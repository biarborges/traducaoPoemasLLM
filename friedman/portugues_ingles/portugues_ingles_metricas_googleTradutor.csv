"a viagem de alexandre à índia
andaste de um ao outro lado da terra na vida interminável,
tiveste degredos, piedosos cíumes, a fé desvanescida,
amantes paradas na lavoura, roubando-te o rosto amado.
viste vestígios de que foste a sombra de ninguém,
olhos sem pudor, do reflexo dos ferros no tropel,
franjas do domínio pueril de alexandre, olhando gaugamela.
partiste num porto de transição para o levante,
com vazios para trás, todo o tempo a poder ver,
e ao primeiro inverno, pelos cardeais das suas cinzas,
começaste a travessia que não termina, a história que não acaba.
soubeste porque se vislumbra, em lágrimas, o pinheiro da juventude,
o nome quebrado num turvo ar medido sem corda,
e a maresia do vento de feição no segundo inverno.
em troca perseguiste o que rege o homem fortuito,
segredando em palácios de mármore que são apenas pedras,
dos fracassos a que jamais alguém ajoelhara.
ao terceiro inverno descobriste o hemisfério, e ao quarto,
sem ideia de guerra ou ordem para mudar o reino,
escolheste adornar os aquedutos sob o manto dos regatos,
sentado, na brisa no tanque, ao febril entardecer.
de quem te aproximaste, no seu trajecto interminado,
sem lugar senão o que esfria na mente recortada,
naquilo que se ramifica, tornando-se na própria teia,
contigo propagou o dever de passar em toda a parte.
e quando veio o quinto inverno, e o sexto, suturaste o sangue,
trouxeste a pele à curva dos rios, acolheste o que de resto se desmorona,
e pudeste enfim, na crença dos migradores furtivos, entender que
tudo se perde noutro lugar ainda, e após esse ainda noutro
e que ao fim de cada manhã noutra manhã
tudo é incerto, tão conforme o dente-de-leão no meio de searas,
tão emudecido como a veia exausta dos não sepultados.

o vento responde, cortando o centeio e o calcário, e a vela
que brilha na luz de estrelas veladas, já desaparecidas,
pisadas, mudas, engolidas aos pés do sétimo inverno,
arpoa o coração e a ruína — os meridianos despem-se, voam
em vinte e cinco anos que há pouco se beijavam, e seja dito ou não dito

i’m thinking of you, dear girl,
your mother’s memory haunts me.
my eyes fill up with tears,
they are bathing you gently.
you were born amid sorrow—
may it yet prove a blessing.
since fortune, struck with envy,
singled you out at birth.
gone forever was contentment,
you heard no joyful voices.
your mother’s life had ended,
while ours went on in sadness.
in anguish born and raised!
i don’t know where all this is going.
i’ve watched you grow, my girl,
with green eyes so lovely.
beauty like yours wasn’t meant
to be born in exile. curses on
fate! this was clearly a work
of malevolence, not a mistake.
here lies your mother,
and we languish in grief.
you did nothing, my girl,
to incur a loss so great.
the fates spurn reason,
and will admit no protest.
i pity your poor father,
for the pain he must lament.
i heard you crying, alone,
before anyone else. you’d not
be here, had i not been there.
still, i ask if i did right.
but surely it can’t be wrong
for you to have been born
with that elegant smile of yours,
those dazzling green eyes.
it’s an unlikely comfort
that i take for myself.
may god grant you the grace
that has eluded you till now.
beauty and good fortune,
or so the old story goes,
were once the best of friends,
but became bitterly opposed.
many hold that it’s fantasy,
but in my life i’ve seen
enough not to doubt it:
fate inflicts great damage.
no harm is ever believed;
we always expect the good.
in hoping and believing
lies an element of change,
an element of concern.",pt_XX,en_XX,"of the girl and young woman
I am thinking of you, daughter
your mother is reminding me
my eyes are filling with tears
I am washing you in her:
you were born a daughter amidst sorrow
so that you may be well-begotten daughter
that at your birth
fortune hears you enviously:
contentment was dead
you heard no joy,
your mother was deceased,
we were all sad:
nothing in pain, in pain grown
I do not know where this will lead
I see you, beautiful daughter
with green eyes growing:
this grace of yours was not to be born in exile
may misfortune
put you more than error:
here was your grave
your mother and sorrow to us
you were not a daughter
not to die for you:
there was no reason in fate
nor is it permitted to beg
of your father I am so sorry
that he will only complain of himself:
I heard you only
first that no one else
you were not yours
I do not know if I did wrong or good:
but it cannot be lady
for any evil to be born
with this graceful smile
that you have under your green eyes:

us that the next morning we would have to leave our homeland; but he soon recovered, saying that Kobanî was no longer really our land, that our house was the ruin of our house, that all of Syria was nothing more than an eardrum exhausted from so much noise and two tired eyes, so tired, from flames and blood. my father thought that Aylan was too young to understand, and so he had simply told him that we were going for a boat ride, that we would spend the day on a beach, and that while my mother and I swam in the sea until we were breathless, he could simply lie face down on the sand, as he so liked. my father never lied to us.",0.5374253186730976,0.7605671105202377,0.9296912550926208,0.97264856

a bicicleta sobre a falta
e se sentava na relva prendendo as lágrimas
as mãos tapando o rosto o rosto entre os geolhos e uma
roda atrás a girar
não havia o ecrã de bolso oportuno
era inevitável encarar o que não tem conserto
nem nunca terá
era do dia o instante altíloquo
uma harmónica crepitava nos auscultadores
feria de morte o touro da tarde
esse búfalo ermo que se aparta da manada
para ficar-se
os subidos candeeiros acendiam
havia um muro recém pintado
sujo já por um grafito de província
um cão passava ao largo levantava o focinho ao
perfume dos jantares
que chegava de onde
se entrevia o espalha-cor dos televisores
havia o farrapo de lua
como flanela posta sobre a ganga das alturas
agraudava os dós arrumados
na caixa do futuro
a hédera das extensões percorria aquela hora
uma ideia sulcava a charneca celeste
o coração alpinista no avesso dos volumes
rarefeito
o mundo era já uma seara de nojo
e fartura – belo desastroso feroz – lugar de forças
e destruições
eu tacteava de olhos fechados
puro intrínseco
procurava um celeiro urbano onde guardar
o ouro-sémen pronto a detonar
a libélula extrema o grilo inicial
a andorinha cujo ninho resulta de um cúmulo
de lama e ervas secas e rasoira
as superfícies alimentando-se no ar
nas minhas costas o exíguo refrigério
da biblioteca pública
àquela hora antro de nebulosos soldados
repousando da luta de guerrilha
hasta la derrota, siempre!
infligiam estragos mínimos a um inimigo
bronco mas relutante
apenas tombavam nas emboscadas aqueles
como eu mais sorumbáticos
tanto oito visível ainda sobre o chão
lavrado à força de rodar no mesmo sítio

that moment when i was really falling apart
and the sun lingered over the lawn, and the palms
billowed above the turbid lake
faraway the promised beetle
reduced those palms to a stump
until they seemed like a pineapple which these days
rots in the gardens
the fountain blandly animated the swamp
of the young
the balconies on fire
the summer beginning at its end
overtime hours those
in which the birds delayed their naps because
of the next shift of insects
hallucinating self-absorbed clamorous
at that hour no one else like me setting their bicycle
down on the dearth
sitting on the grass holding back tears
covering their face with their hands, face between their knees and a
wheel behind still spinning
there was no convenient pocket screen
facing up to that which can’t be fixed and never will be

it was on that day the eloquent moment
a harmonica crackled in my headphones
mortally wounding the afternoon’s bull
that solitary buffalo that steers clear of the herd
to die
the high lamps lit up
a newly painted wall
already marked with a small town’s graffito
a dog went past lifting its snout to the
scent of dinners
which came from where
the televisions’ color-blend rose in the air
there was the shred of moon
like flannel sewn onto the denim of the heights
it nurtured hoarded hurt
in the box of the future
the ivy of extensions twined through that hour
an idea furrowed the celestial fen
the mountaineer heart inside the volumes
rarefied
the world was already a glebe of lamentation
and overabundance – beautiful disastrous fierce – locus of forces
and ruin
i fingered with my eyes closed
pure intrinsic
searched out an urban granary where i could keep
the semen-gold ready to detonate
the extreme dragonfly the first cricket
the swallow who got up its nest in a cumulus
of mud and dried weeds who smooths
the surfaces feeding itself in the air
at my back the exiguous cooling
of the public library
at that hour a cavern of nebulous soldiers
resting from their war of resistance
hasta la derrota, siempre!
they inflicted little damage on a rough
but reluctant enemy
only those as sullen as i
walked into ambushes
so many figure eights still visible on the ground
forcefully hoed up from repeatedly going round in the same place

were waving in a murky lake

of youth

for me it makes little difference: poet, poetess –

2.
my earliest poetry was about rain
and weeping. today it would be
prose and rain, or gunpowder:
it's raining out, wind rapes the window,
a street is never like the brochures –
with fine eloquence i stab my note
to the world through my heart.
it bursts, withered muscle bloat –
a thousand times that life were more than art.

if the line’s strict measure doesn’t aim to show
but is a seeking instead –
or is the taste of what it finds . . .
if i don’t write to order,
but showered by latter rain.

certainly, i can pose
for the camera,
mold my mouth to the click, close
down the diaphragm. it depends

whole day that climaxed in the minus-one ground of this brief logarithmic

guindastes do porto de roterdão, e apago-o com

das mães, afogavam-se em lama, no meio dos sambos. as paredes
das casas diluíam-se em nata e os oleiros desistiram de encomendar
a sua obra a deus. enormes cuidados foram inventados
para proteger o fogo nos altares e as crianças adoptaram a nudez.
as termiteiras deixaram de existir e as formigas aladas
perderam as asas. os pés dos mais-velhos fenderam-se em chagas
e as mamas das virgens, mal eram tocadas, colavam-se aos dedos
como cinza húmida. os lábios dos sexos das mulheres paridas
inchavam carnudos de uma carne branca e os ventres pendiam
como fruta mole.

ficou colado ao trono e ao boi sagrado cresceram-lhe os olhos,
que depois cegaram. as sementes grelaram nos celeiros
e essa semente assim era servida aos homens e daí lhes ocorreu
um tal vigor que os seus sexos cresceram desmedidos
e os homens vacilaram, tendo-os nas mãos e mudos de fascínio.
a chuva choveu tanto que as serpentes saíram dos buracos
e vieram alongar-se ao pé dos paus, mantendo com esforço
as cabeças erguidas. nas terrinas do leite vicejavam musgos
e o leite das vacas alterou-se em soro, a coalhar na urina.

talos e as enxurradas produziram peixe e até o ferro se lavou
sozinho e os diamantes vieram rebolar nas pedras concavadas
de moer farinha. as próprias aves morreram quase todas
e apenas se salvaram as de penas brancas, que a distância atraiu,
depois comeu.

que se animaram e até pedras comuns a transmudar-se em carne.

o sentido. as gargantas entupiram-se de limos
e as testas que os velhos pousavam nas mãos fundiam-se aos dedos
e os braços às pernas e os gestos de graça fundiam os corpos
e as jovens crianças ficavam coladas ao peito das mães.
só as bocas teimavam em manter-se abertas e quando mais tarde

"os figos de d.h. lawrence
lawrence aconselhou a que se partisse um figo
em quatro pedaços, para o comer, depois de deitar fora
a casca. deste modo, pensava ele, a sociedade não veria
com maus olhos o gesto de cortar o figo, e de o
saborear lentamente, como quem lê um poema. mas
nem todos os figos se podem comer desta maneira; e,
no caso dos figos verdes, o melhor é tirar-lhes a pele a
partir de cima, sem que ela se desprenda completamente
do fruto; e só depois de comer a parte de cima, é que
chegará o momento em que só vai ficar um pouco de figo
a segurar a casca. nessa altura, pode-se arrancá-la, e acabar
de comer o que sobra, para que a refeição fique completa.
de facto, lawrence também admite esta solução (e
aceita que se coma também a casca); mas teremos
de ir mais longe do que ele, o que significa
que se deve também pensar na figueira. e se, ao comermos
o figo, a árvore nos agarra a alma com os seus ramos
ásperos, obrigando-nos a afastar as folhas para ver como
é que se pode fugir debaixo dela, o sabor que fica na boca
lembra a imagem da mulher primitiva, com o seu ventre redondo
como o dos figos de s. joão, os primeiros, que se colhem
com um gesto só, ficando inteiros na mão. então, a mão
torna-se um prolongamento da figueira, e começo a pensar
que talvez possam nascer folhas de figueira nos braços,
como se estes fossem ramos; e que essas folhas servirão para
tapar os figos que irei colher, mantendo a sua frescura.
em alternativa, poderei transformar o tronco da figueira
num corpo de mulher nua; e essas folhas irão vesti-la. mas o figo
que tenho na mão far-me-á sentir os seus seios macios, fazendo
com que, ao tirar a casca do figo, a mulher saia de dentro dele,
e eu possa chegar à mesma conclusão de lawrence sobre
as múltiplas formas de comer um figo.","d.h. lawrence’s figs
lawrence recommended that the fig be divided into
into four pieces, for eating, after discarding
the skin. in this way, he reasoned, society would not look
askance upon the act of cutting open the fig and of
savoring it slowly, as one would read a poem. but
not all figs can be eaten in such a way; and
in the case of green figs, it’s better to skin them from
the top down, without separating the skin completely
from the fruit; it’s only after eating the top part, that
the moment arrives where there is only a bit of fig left
clinging to its skin. then you can finally pluck it, and finish
eating what is left, for the meal to be complete.
indeed, lawrence also acknowledges this solution (and
also says it’s okay to eat the skin); but we must
go even further than he does, which means that we must
also consider the tree itself. and if, while we’re eating
the fig, the tree grabs our soul with its rough
branches, making it necessary to pull back its leaves to see how
it is we can escape beneath it, the taste which lingers in the mouth
recalls the image of the primitive woman, with her round womb
like the one of the early figs of saint john, the first ones, that are gathered up
whole, in one sweep of the hand. so, my hand
becomes an extension of the fig tree, and i begin to think
that perhaps fig leaves will start growing from my arms,
as though they were branches; and that these leaves will hide
the figs that i will gather, keeping them fresh.
alternatively, i could transform the trunk of the fig tree
into the body of a naked woman; and these leaves would adorn her. but the fig
that i have in my hand will make me feel her soft breasts, making
it seem like in stripping the skin from the fig the woman might appear from within,
and i would reach the same conclusion as lawrence about
the many ways to eat a fig.",pt_XX,en_XX,"d.h. lawrence's figs
lawrence advised that a fig should be cut into four pieces and eaten after discarding the skin. this way, he thought, society would not look down on the gesture of cutting the fig and savoring it slowly, as if reading a poem. but not all figs can be eaten this way; and, in the case of green figs, it is best to remove the skin from the top, without letting it completely detach from the fruit; and only after eating the top part will the moment come when only a little fig will be left holding the skin. at that point, it can be torn off and the rest eaten, so that the meal is complete. in fact, lawrence also accepts this solution (and accepts that the skin should also be eaten); but we will have to go further than that, which means that we must also think about the fig tree. and if, when we eat the fig, the tree grabs our soul with its rough branches, forcing us to push the leaves aside to see how we can escape from under it, the taste that remains in our mouths reminds us of the image of the primitive woman, with her round belly like that of the figs of St. John, the first ones, which are picked with a single gesture, remaining whole in the hand. then, the hand becomes an extension of the fig tree, and I begin to think that perhaps fig leaves can grow on the arms, as if they were branches; and that these leaves will serve to cover the figs that I will pick, keeping them fresh. alternatively, I can transform the trunk of the fig tree into the body of a naked woman; and these leaves will clothe her. but the fig
that I have in my hand will make me feel her soft breasts, making
that, when I remove the fig's skin, the woman comes out of it,
and I can reach the same conclusion as lawrence about
the multiple ways of eating a fig.",0.4567548121470377,0.6539713862851504,0.9098279476165771,0.96618176

mes vacances: I really enjoyed the holidays
je suis allée à la plage (with two ee,
the verb ètre requires agreement), j'ai beaucoup
nagé and then I would finish with the sun setting
in the sea and I would go and see seagulls in the dictionary
the corrections in red and the passé simple,
writing a hundred times nous fûmes vous fûtes ils fûrent
the sunny afternoons
and madame denise who would say toi ma petite
with the air of a sergeant and her angry face turning
red (I have too many blood cells, please pay attention)
and the look that denied everything
in tenderness remplit
and the rules I had memorized and the verb endings
ais, ais, ait,

filtering through the desks,
the nun watching distractedly in psalms
me dreaming with an open book

and the third-degree equations to an

to be good, it wasn't the little saint or the candy
it was the sweet word caressing me inside,
the all-white gowns splashed with colorful gouache
and the blue belt that I always wore loose
so falling to the side like a swordsman

like attending prayer in the chapel and reading the epistles
(from Saint Paul to the Corinthians:
at that time...),
she has a beautiful voice and reads so well, and then
they told me to tighten my belt to be
more composed on top of the little stool,
to the right of the priest

the whispered voices in the thin brown wood
hiding a fault,
the smell of the sealed floor and the wax of the candles

"o sentimento dum ocidental
i
ave-marias
nas nossas ruas, ao anoitecer,
há tal soturnidade, há tal melancolia,
que as sombras, o bulício, o tejo, a maresia
despertam-me um desejo absurdo de sofrer.
o céu parece baixo e de neblina,
o gás extravasado enjoa-me, perturba;
e os edifícios, com as chaminés, e a turba
toldam-se duma cor monótona e londrina.
batem carros de aluguer, ao fundo,
levando à via-férrea os que se vão. felizes!
ocorrem-me em revista exposições, países:
madrid, paris, berlim, s. petersburgo, o mundo!
semelham-se a gaiolas, com viveiros,
as edificações somente emadeiradas:
como morcegos, ao cair das badaladas,
saltam de viga em viga os mestres carpinteiros.
voltam os calafates, aos magotes,
de jaquetão ao ombro, enfarruscados, secos;
embrenho-me, a cismar, por boqueirões, por becos,
ou erro pelos cais a que se atracam botes.
e evoco, então, as crónicas navais:
mouros, baixéis, heróis, tudo ressuscitado!
luta camões no sul, salvando um livro a nado!
singram soberbas naus que eu não verei jamais!
e o fim da tarde inspira-me; e incomoda!
de um couraçado inglês vogam os escaleres;
e em terra num tinir de louças e talheres
flamejam, ao jantar alguns hotéis da moda.
num trem de praça arengam dois dentistas;
um trôpego arlequim braceja numas andas;
os querubins do lar flutuam nas varandas;
às portas, em cabelo, enfadam-se os lojistas!
vazam-se os arsenais e as oficinas;
reluz, viscoso, o rio, apressam-se as obreiras;
e num cardume negro, hercúleas, galhofeiras,
correndo com firmeza, assomam as varinas.
vêm sacudindo as ancas opulentas!
seus troncos varonis recordam-me pilastras;
e algumas, à cabeça, embalam nas canastras
os filhos que depois naufragam nas tormentas.
descalças! nas descargas de carvão,
desde manhã à noite, a bordo das fragatas;
e apinham-se num bairro aonde miam gatas,
e o peixe podre gera os focos de infecção!

toca-se às grades, nas cadeias. som
que mortifica e deixa umas loucuras mansas!
o aljube, em que hoje estão velhinhas e crianças,
bem raramente encerra uma mulher de “dom”!
e eu desconfio, até, de um aneurisma
tão mórbido me sinto, ao acender das luzes;
à vista das prisões, da velha sé, das cruzes,
chora-me o coração que se enche e que se abisma.
a espaços, iluminam-se os andares,
e as tascas, os cafés, as tendas, os estancos
alastram em lençol os seus reflexos brancos;
e a lua lembra o circo e os jogos malabares.
duas igrejas, num saudoso largo,
lançam a nódoa negra e fúnebre do clero:
nelas esfumo um ermo inquisidor severo,
assim que pela história eu me aventuro e alargo.
na parte que abateu no terremoto,
muram-me as construções rectas, iguais, crescidas;
afrontam-me, no resto, as íngremes subidas,
e os sinos dum tanger monástico e devoto.
mas, num recinto público e vulgar,
com bancos de namoro e exíguas pimenteiras,
brônzeo, monumental, de proporções guerreiras,
um épico doutrora ascende, num pilar!
e eu sonho o cólera, imagino a febre,
nesta acumulação de corpos enfezados;
sombrios e espectrais recolhem os soldados;
inflama-se um palácio em face de um casebre.
partem patrulhas de cavalaria
dos arcos dos quartéis que foram já conventos;
idade média! a pé, outras, a passos lentos,
derramam-se por toda a capital, que esfria.
triste cidade! eu temo que me avives
uma paixão defunta! aos lampiões distantes,
enlutam-me, alvejando, as tuas elegantes,
curvadas a sorrir às montras dos ourives.
e mais: as costureiras, as floristas
descem dos magasins, causam-me sobressaltos;
custa-lhes a elevar os seus pescoços altos
e muitas delas são comparsas ou coristas.

eu acho sempre assunto a quadros revoltados:

ao riso e à crua luz joga-se o dominó.","the feeling of a westerner

when evening falls across our streets
and sullen melancholy fills the air,
the tagus, the tang, the shadows and bustle
bring me an absurd desire to suffer.
the sky hangs low and seems all hazy;
the gas from the streetlamps makes me queasy;
the tumult of buildings, chimneys and people
is cloaked in a dullish, londonish hue.
oh lucky travellers in hired coaches
now hieing to the railway station! countries
and exhibitions file past me: madrid,
paris, berlin, st petersburg, the world!
the timber frames of future buildings
resemble cages for keeping animals;
like swooping bats the carpenters leap
from beam to beam at the sound of the bell.
clusters of callous, tar-smeared caulkers
return from the slipways, coats on their shoulders;
i wander through alleys that lead to the river
or walk by the wharves where boats are docked.
i evoke the ocean chronicles: the moors,
old vessels and heroes – all resurrected!
shipwrecked camões swims his book to shore! (1)
great carracks that i’ll never see ride the waves!
the twilight inspires, and also disturbs me!
an english battleship launches its cutters
while swank hotels on land bedazzle
with china and flatware clinking at dinner.
two dentists argue inside a streetcar;
a clumsy clown is struggling on stilts;
children flit, like cherubs, on balconies;
hatless, bored shopkeepers wait at their doors!
the shipyards and workshops are emptying out;
the river glints thickly, the workwomen hurry;
and a black school of herculean fishwives
bursts out of nowhere, joking, laughing.
wagging sumptuous hips they come!
their manly torsos remind me of pillars;
and some, in the baskets on their heads,
rock sons who’ll one day drown in storms.
on frigates – barefoot! – they unload coal (2)
from dawn to dusk, then crowd together
in a neighbourhood where cats meow
and the rotting fish breed infection!

after dark
prisoners bang on the bars of their cells –
a sound that rattles my nerves with shame!
the aljube jail, for old women and children,
rarely encloses a titled lady!
i feel so ill as the lights come on
i worry i might have an aneurysm;
the sight of the jails, crosses, cathedral,
fills and sinks my heart with tears.
one floor after another lights up,
and cafés, restaurants, tobacco and other shops
spread like a sheet their white reflections.
the moon brings jugglers, the circus, to mind.
on an ancient square two churches raise
the clergy’s black, funereal spectre;
i sketch there a lonely, dour inquisitor,
daring to extend myself into history.
in quarters which the earthquake flattened
equal, straight buildings wall me in; (3)
everywhere else i face steep streets
and the tolling of pious, monastic bells.
but gracing a common, public square
with lovers’ benches and lithe pepper trees
a war-sized monument cast in bronze
stands, on a pillar, for an epic that was! (4)
and in this assemblage of stunted bodies
i think of the fever, imagine the cholera;
returning soldiers look sombre as ghosts;
a gleaming palace stands opposite a hovel.
mounted patrolmen set out from the archways
of army barracks that once were convents;
the middle ages! others, on foot,
range through the capital, now turning cold.
sad town! i dread you’ll arouse a dead passion
in me! i mourn upon seeing your elegant
ladies so white in the lamp-lit distance,
leaning and smiling at jewellers’ windows.
coming down from the department stores,
the florists and dressmakers wrench my gut;
they’re hardly able to hold up their heads,
and many are walk-ons and chorus girls.

harshly lit, they laugh and play dominoes.",pt_XX,en_XX,"the feeling of a westerner

in our streets, at dusk,
there is such gloom, such melancholy,
that the shadows, the hustle and bustle, the Tagus, the sea air
awaken in me an absurd desire to suffer.
the sky seems low and foggy,
the leaking gas makes me nauseous, disturbs me;
and the buildings, with their chimneys, and the crowd
are covered in a monotonous, London color.
hired cars crash in the background,
taking those who are leaving to the railway. happy!
exhibitions, countries come to mind in review:
madrid, paris, berlin, st. petersburg, the world!
the buildings are like cages, with aviaries,
the only wooden buildings:
like bats, when the chimes fall,
the master carpenters jump from beam to beam.
the caulkers return in droves,
with their jackets on their shoulders, dirty, dry;
I wander off, wondering, through gorges, through alleys,
or wander along the quays where boats are moored.
and then I recall the naval chronicles:
Moors, ships, heroes, all resurrected!
Camões fights in the south, saving a book by swimming!
Superb ships sail that I will never see!
and the end of the afternoon inspires me; and disturbs me!
the longboats of an English battleship sail;
and on land, with the clanging of crockery and cutlery,
some fashionable hotels blaze at dinner.
on a train, two dentists harangue;
a clumsy harlequin swings his arms on stilts;
the cherubs of the home float on the balconies;
at the doors, in their hair, the shopkeepers are getting angry!
the arsenals and workshops are empty;
the river shines, viscous, the workers hurry;
and in a black shoal, Herculean, playful,
running firmly, the fishwives appear.
they come shaking their opulent hips!
their manly torsos remind me of pillars;
and some, at the head, rock in baskets
their children who later sink in the storms.
barefoot! in the coal dumps,
from morning to night, on board the frigates;
and they crowd into a neighborhood where cats meow,
and the rotten fish generates foci of infection!
ii
in the dead of night
they knock on the bars, in the prisons. a sound
that mortifies and leaves some gentle madness! the dungeon, where old women and children are today,
rarely holds a woman of gift!
and I even suspect an aneurysm
so morbid I feel, when I turn on the lights;
at the sight of the prisons, the old cathedral, the crosses,
my heart weeps, filling and sinking.
at times, the floors light up,
and the taverns, the cafés, the tents, the stalls
spread out their white reflections like a sheet;
and the moon reminds me of the circus and juggling games.
two churches, in a long-missed square,
cast the black and funereal stain of the clergy:
in them I see a severe inquisitorial wasteland,
so that I venture and expand through history.
in the part that was destroyed by the earthquake,
the straight, equal, tall buildings wall me up;
I am confronted, in the rest, by the steep climbs,
and the bells of a monastic and devout ringing.
but, in a public and common place,
with courtship benches and small pepper trees,
bronze, monumental, of warlike proportions,
an epic of old rises, on a pillar!
and I dream of cholera, I imagine fever,
in this accumulation of emaciated bodies;
somber and spectral, the soldiers gather;
a palace catches fire opposite a hovel.
cavalry patrols set off
from the arches of the barracks that were once convents;
the Middle Ages! on foot, others, at slow pace,
spread throughout the capital, which is growing cold.
sad city! I fear that you are rekindling
a dead passion in me! to the distant street lamps,
your elegant women,
bent over smiling in the goldsmiths' windows,
mourn me,
and what's more: the seamstresses and the florists
come down from the stores,
they startle me;
they have trouble raising their tall necks
and many of them are accomplices or chorus girls.

quem quer que lhe tivesse concebido os ossos, era então visível o objectivo de os fazer florir. deles brotaria a pele, o céu, a encenação da glória. tudo isso mais não eram, entretanto, do que imagens em apuros, imagens atacadas por memórias em conflito com o presente, ou mesmo com o passado onde pareciam radicar, e que, esbeiçando-se nos bordos, davam lugar a que o esquecimento sobre elas actuasse como uma espécie de ácido sulfúrico.

descuidadas, um homem cisma, confia
do caminho ao macho lento a decisão.

a retórica não serve. trata-se de uma coisa simples, que não
precisa de requintes nem de fórmulas. apanha-se

no meio do campo, nem das que se vendem nas lojas
ou nos mercados. é uma flor de sílabas, em que as
pétalas são as vogais, e o caule uma consoante. põe-se
no jarro da estrofe, e deixa-se estar. para que não morra,
basta um pedaço de primavera na água, que se vai
buscar à imaginação, quando está um dia de chuva,
ou se faz entrar pela janela, quando o ar fresco
da manhã enche o quarto de azul. então,
a flor confunde-se com o poema, mas ainda não é
o poema. para que ele nasça, a flor precisa
de encontrar cores mais naturais do que essas
que a natureza lhe deu. podem ser as cores do teu
rosto – a sua brancura, quando o sol vem ter contigo,
ou o fundo dos teus olhos em que todas as cores
da vida se confundem, com o brilho da vida. depois,
deito essas cores sobre a corola, e vejo-as descerem

on a rainy day, is fetched from the imagination,

of morning fills the blue room. this is when
the flower begins to seem like a poem, but it’s still not
the poem. for it to really sprout, the flower needs
to find more natural colors than those
which nature gave it. they might be the colors
of your complexion – its whiteness, when the sun falls on you,
or the depths of your eyes in which all the colors
of life mix with the sheen of life. after that,

beijavam. não precisava de gestos ou palavras,
bastava-lhe ser ouvido, partilhar o impartilhável

capaz de matar (mas não a ele) por uma cerveja,

a quinta sinfonia, numa gravação
de klemperer. as manhãs
e as tardes auguravam um futuro
melhor, prendados costumes
que depressa perdi. já então olhava
para a taberna da ana,
enchendo a janela do meu quarto.
tinha medo da sombra, do silêncio,
adivinhando em cada passo o monstro
que me habitava. e lia, para não pensar,
desacreditados escritores franceses.
um dia, de tanto o amar,
peguei no disco e quebrei-o
em pequenos pedaços de vinil
– para doerem mais, melhor.
mantive, não sei bem porquê,
a dura capa de cartão,
essa fúnebre alegoria da infância.
e o que sobrou do disco foi parar
ao ribeiro junto à casa dos meus pais.
mais tarde, o ribeiro com hortas
de domingo à volta foi sufocado pelo terror
de um aldeamento, versão provinciana
de condomínio fechado, num mundo
em que são cada vez mais as portas.

de me comover, soterrado como as rãs
pelas mãos invisíveis de quem mata.

tempo, é perceber que fiz a esse disco
o mesmo que faço e volto a fazer
aos corpos que julgo amar:
parti-los, muito devagar, para
que doam sempre um pouco mais.","grimy bits of vinyl
it must have been the most-played record:
the fifth symphony, conducted
by klemperer. the mornings
and afternoons promised a better
future, virtuous habits,
which i soon forgot. i was already eyeing
ana’s tavern,
which filled my bedroom window.
i feared the shadows, silence,
feeling in each footstep the monster
inside me. and i read, so as not to think,
discredited french writers.
i loved it so much that one day
i grabbed the record and broke it
to bits – tiny bits of vinyl –
so that they’d hurt even more.
i’m not sure why, but i kept
the stiff cardboard jacket,
that lugubrious allegory of childhood.
and the remains of the record ended up
in the stream next to my parents’ house.
later on the stream, flanked by weekend
vegetable patches, was strangled by an implacable
housing development, the provincial version
of a gated condominium, in a world
with ever more doors.
as for beethoven, buried like the frogs

quem tão baixa tivesse a fantasia
que nunca em mores cousas a metesse
que em só levar seu gado à fonte fria
e mungir-lhe o leite que bebesse!
quão bem-aventurado que seria!
que, por mais que fortuna revolvesse,
nunca em si sentiria maior pena
que pesar-lhe da vida ser pequena.
veria erguer do sol a roxa face,
veria correr sempre a clara fonte,
sem imaginar a água donde nace,
nem quem a luz esconde no horizonte.
tangendo a frauta donde o gado pace,
conheceria as ervas do alto monte;
em deus creria, simples e quieto,
sem mais especular nenhum secreto.

entre as cousas da velha antiguidade,
que perdido um grão tempo o siso teve
por causa dũa grande infirmidade;
e enquanto, de si fora, doudo esteve,
tinha por teima e cria por verdade,
que eram suas as naus que navegavam,
quantas no porto píreo ancoravam.
por um senhor mui grande se teria
(além da vida alegre que passava),
pois nas que se perdiam não perdia,
e das que vinham salvas se alegrava.
não tardou muito tempo quando, um dia,
um crito, seu irmão, que ausente estava,
à terra chega; e vendo o irmão perdido,
do fraternal amor foi comovido.

o faz estar à cura refusada.

lhe tira a doce vida descansada!

dos trabalhos que o siso lhe obrigava,
e despois de não ver o estado antigo
que a vã opinião lhe apresentava,
—ó inimigo irmão, com cor d’amigo!
para que me tiraste (suspirava)
da mais quieta vida e livre em tudo
que nunca pôde ter nenhum sesudo?
por que rei, por que duque me trocara?
por que senhor de grande fortaleza?
que me dava que o mundo se acabara,
ou que a ordem mudasse a natureza?
agora é-me pesada a vida cara;
sei que cousa é trabalho e que tristeza.

que na doudice só consiste o siso.","on the world\'s chaos and confusion (excerpt)
happy the man who never places
his small and humble fantasy
in anything greater than simply leading
his cattle to drink from the cold spring
and drawing their milk so that he can drink!
however fortune may stir things up,
he’ll never feel any greater grief
than the weight of knowing his life is brief.
he’ll see the rising sun’s red face
and see the clear spring always flowing,
not wondering where the water comes from
nor who on the horizon hides the light.
playing the flute where his cattle graze,
he’ll know the grass that covers the hill;
in god he’ll simply and calmly believe,
not pondering truths he can’t conceive.
among the things of antiquity,
it’s written of a certain thrasyllus
that, due to a grave infirmity,
he lost his senses for a long season,
during which time, bereft of reason,
he claimed and believed that all the ships
which at the port of piraeus landed
were ships he owned if not commanded.
he took himself for a mighty lord
and enjoyed as well a happy life,
since he lost nothing when ships were lost,
and rejoiced for those that landed safely.
time went by till one day crito
his brother returned after a long absence
and, seeing how thrasyllus had lost his wits,
was moved by fraternal love to pity.
he gave him to doctors, charging them
to perform the cure thus far refused.
alas! by restoring his brother’s senses,
he robbed him of his sweet easy life!
the herbs of apollo, without delay,
gave him back his former health.
now of sound mind, thrasyllus thanked
his brother for caring, not for his act.
for when he saw himself in danger
of the toils that sanity would impose
and saw no more that state of privilege
conferred on him by his fantasy,
he sighed: “o enemy brother, pretended
friend, why did you take from me
that life so calm and free of pains,
which can’t be had by anyone sane?
“what king, or duke or mighty lord
would i have wished to trade places with?
what did i care if the world ended
or if nature’s order suddenly changed?
now dear life is a heavy burden,
for i know what toil and sadness are.
restore me to that state of bliss;
the only sane condition is madness.”",pt_XX,en_XX,"on the world's confusion (excerpt)
whoever had such a low imagination
that he would never put it into anything else
than just taking his cattle to the cold spring
and milking them to drink!
how blessed he would be!
who, no matter how much fortune turned,
would never feel greater sorrow
than the regret that his life was short.
he would see the sun rise the purple face,
he would see the clear spring always run,
without imagining the water from which it springs,
nor who the light hides on the horizon.
playing the flute from which the cattle pace,
he would know the grasses of the high mountain;
he would believe in God, simple and quiet,
without further speculating on any secret.
of a certain Thrasylaus it is read and written,
among the things of ancient antiquity,
that his wisdom lost a great deal of time
because of great infirmity; and while he was out of his mind, he was stubborn and believed to be true, that the ships that were sailing were his, as many as were anchored in the Pyrenean port. he would have been a great master (in addition to the happy life he was living), because he did not lose in those that were lost, and he was happy with those that were saved. It was not long before, one day, a Christian, his brother, who was absent, arrived on land; and seeing his brother lost, he was moved by fraternal love. He handed him over to the doctors, and with a warning, he had him refused a cure. sad, that by restoring his dear sense, he took away his sweet and peaceful life! the Apollonian herbs, suddenly, restored him to his former health. wise, Thrasylaus thanked his dear brother for his will, but not for his work. because, after seeing himself in danger
of the work that his sense of sense forced him to do,
and after not seeing the old state
that his vain opinion presented to him,
—oh, brother enemy, with the color of a friend!
why did you take me (he sighed)
from the most peaceful and free life in everything
that no sensible person could ever have?
For what king, for what duke did I exchange?
For what lord of a great fortress?
What did it matter to me that the world had ended,
or that order changed nature?

I know what work is and what sadness.

since it is in what we have lost that we have been letting live.”

will it be worth the effort to pretend, to our poor followers,
that in our greetings we are nothing more than compensating for our fear?
we will lie, yes, but for different reasons, some of them you mentioned,
others because we do not see ourselves wavering in one more departure. precisely, such is the acrid smell of the first rains of summer,
we grow from soul to soul that passes through us and guarantees
the line of life that we have allowed to be made.

"twilight
uma mulher estava nos cuidados intensivos
enevoada em suas ligaduras
e tubos nas narinas e nas mãos
que se agitavam e tudo era metálico,
mas ela, a retalhada,
era só tempo incerto, interrogado e trôpego,
só gemido sem voz quando o homem ansioso
se debruçava na contagem dos segundos,
mas ela, a gotejante,
era um puro intervalo numa frouxa fronteira,
só um peso de pálpebras e noite espessa, quando ele, debruçado,
murmurava as palavras, as que ela não ouvia.
terminada a visita, um olhar de relance, um último
desse dia, cercou-a de silêncios pensativos.
a interrogação, a negação da esperança, são como a rosa negra
das condições da esperança.
despiu a bata branca obrigatória, foi-se devagar
e guardou-lhe o rosto translúcido envolto em gazes leves.
há quanto tempo foi? em que lugar, em que manhã furtiva da memória?
quem era o homem? que palavras proferia?
hoje não sei. é como ver da rua uma figura entre cortinas
numa corrente de ar, às vezes penso que era eu,
mas pergunto também, seria alguém por mim, numa curva do tempo,
a murmurar tão baixo palavras esquecidas?
mas se não era eu, como é que soube dessa voz comovida
a resvalar assim até ser inaudível
fora do coração? e se era eu, como pude
tão de dentro falar, tão apagadamente?
porque eu procuro outros andamentos do mundo,
outros nós na garganta, mais pensados a frio, outras intensidades
sacudidas, mais distantes da emoção imediata,
e nunca mais diria palavras tão obscuras.
não interessa quem era. os mares, os ventos
rolaram e rodaram e foram erodindo verdades, circunstâncias.

a woman lay in intensive care
in a fog of bandages with tubes
entering her nostrils and hands,
which twitched, and it was all metallic,
but she, the cut and punctured,
was just a question of tottering, uncertain time,
just a voiceless moan when the troubled man
leaned over in the countdown of seconds,

was a pure interlude on a weak frontier,
just the weight of eyelids and thick night, when he, leaning over,
murmured the words she didn’t hear.

how long ago was it? in what place, in what furtive morning of memory?
who was the man? what words did he proffer?

through wind-blown curtains. sometimes i think it was me,
but i also wonder if someone in my stead, in a fold of time,
might have so softly murmured the forgotten words.
but if it wasn’t me, how did i know about that choked voice
that kept slipping until it could no longer be heard
outside the heart? and if it was me, how could i
have spoken so inwardly, in such a muffled tone?
because it’s other rhythms i seek in the world, other,
more coldly considered knots in the throat, other trembling
intensities, more detached from immediate emotion,

aos amantes enlaçados contraponho
um cão de pompeia, decerto ele andaria
a brincar junto ao forum, à cata de algum osso,
quando o vesúvio o caçou, mais lesto,
para moldá-lo em pedra-pomes.
insisto em vê-lo como um bicho magro e descuidado,
de penúria diuturna. passou de leve
pelos peristilos, alheio ao luxo, à corrupção,
à astrologia, e nunca dos triclínios
lhe caiu um naco envenenado, nunca se tornou
nem animal simbólico, nem mito que ganisse.
nunca foi encontrado nas escavações, mas é para aqui chamado.
era um cão, just a dog, com pulgas e
que alçava a perna como todos os cães
e ladrava e mordia quando era preciso.
fazia pela vida e, fauno das esquinas, pelas cadelas no cio.
alguma tabuleta diria cave canem em tésseras minúsculas,
sem alaridos da história, e só sobreviveu
nos livros de latim expurgados, misturada
com a guerra das gálias e alguns nomes de deuses.

talvez uivando, uns dias depois dele.

rather than a pair of embracing lovers i propose
a dog from pompei. one that was no doubt
frolicking next to the forum, in search of a bone,

on seeing him as a scrawny, neglected creature
for whom poverty was a way of life. he skipped
through peristyles, a stranger to luxury, to corruption
to astrology, and no poisoned morsel ever befell him

making no mark in history, surviving only
in expurgated books in latin, mixed up
with the gallic wars and a few names of gods.

an ordinary mutt belonging, let’s say, to pliny
the elder, who happens to have died nearby,
perhaps screaming, a few days later.
“you’re so cerebral,” said vexed and golden-haired chloe.

"para a educação sentimental
tantas vezes se vive de uma arrebatada
noção dos contrastes mais fortes entre o bem e o
mal, entre a grandeza e a abjecção, entre as rápidas
peripécias de um heroísmo ansioso e o destino inexorável,
que o melodrama é da nossa mais funda natureza,
nostálgica, obscuramente nostálgica do coração radical,
do que vai à desfilada nos sonhos contraditórios,
do que engendra imagens capciosas e julga viver em liberdade,
mas é só imprudente e explosivo, mas esbarra
nas malhas deste mundo, nos imprevistos
da traição e da morte, ou tem de renunciar perante os rasgos
mais sublimes. a paixão dilacera bruscamente as personagens
apegadas à felicidade, os obstáculos
também têm protagonistas, ajustes de contas, cruéis fulgores,
perseguições, e nos casos desvairados de amor não há saída.
desse falhanço insuportável nasce o melodrama,
lírico, incontido, entre golfadas de espiral vertiginosa
com o sangue e a memória, com o que não tem remédio e a música trágica,
em que alguém vai morrer, alguém se perde alucinado,
e alguém se salva e porventura alguém escreve
a história e alguém lhe junta a música
para as emoções serem mais opressivas e talvez mais devoradoras
e mais fáceis, e alguém tem o desejo disso, um estremecimento
de arrepio e vulgaridade, um ávido prazer inconfessado.","sentimental education
we often live according to a rash
notion of stark contrasts between good
and evil, greatness and wretchedness, the swift deeds
of an avid heroism and the inexorable march of destiny,
melodrama being part of our deepest nature,
obscurely but stubbornly nostalgic for the radical heart,
which races at top speed in contradictory dreams,
which engenders seductive images and thinks it lives in freedom,
but it’s merely reckless and explosive, it stumbles
into the world’s snares, into unexpected
treachery and death, or it must renounce in the face of the most
sublime flashes. passion rudely lacerates people
attached to happiness. the obstacles we meet
also have protagonists, scores to settle, cruel splendors,
feverish pursuits. and in desperate cases of love there’s no way out.
from that unbearable failure is born lyrical, unbridled
melodrama, amid whirling, dizzying spurts
of blood and memory, of dashed hopes and tragic music,
in which someone dies, someone goes mad,
and someone is saved, and maybe someone writes down
the story, and someone else adds music

of windows, it speaks to us of the worn gold of these days,
of that meaning gained in the things that are lost,
salivating the passing of the hours, sustaining
the drain of our lives against pain.
we remember the little oracles of childhood,
the dreams that are memories already in their dark
tower of collapse, when we summon, in the quiet
of the town, the elusive soul of the past. we seek
a reward in yesterday, knowing that there is no
other man for the man of this place,
cleaner blood running through the flesh
of those who are born, their genuine pastoral death.
the time of the harvest has come, of the omens
brought from afar in the murmur of autumnal trumpets.
the words, the trembling branches of the words,
sensate the spirit of revelation in each thing.
thus we mourn the last feast of moments,
days of a faithful mist cover our steps,
obscuring those hands that would like to climb
to heaven like ladders. if I knew the easy language
of tribute I would sing the predicted fall

e há troar de canhões além dos muros da cidade,
queria o direito a uma hora indulgente e fugaz,
num espaço inviolável,
guardado pelas asas da musa e os provérbios da sibila
como o actor recolhido aos bastidores do teatro.
esquecidos os sonhos da cabeça adornada por folhas de louro
ou os canapés onde se alongam as últimas almas epicuristas,
num sossego adverbial, em que nada mais ouvisse,
tudo ele pudesse guardar, no âmbito da sua arte,
com a leveza que deixa a pluma ao roçar o papel.
purificada, ao salivá-la como hóstia sob a língua,
cada palavra tivesse a autoridade da grinalda
ou do selo real
e estreitasse numa sebe o mundo que conheceu,
enquanto tudo se gentiliza e desmorona à sua volta.
nesse trabalho de falcoaria sobre o tempo ido,
escrever lembra-lhe os cortes feitos pela navalha
do prisioneiro na parede da cela, contando os dias,
certo de esperá-lo o nó corrediço da forca
ou o tiro disparado de frente sobre o crânio.
sabendo todo o seu trabalho entregue nessa hora
à dispersão,
deseja salvar, consoladora e suficiente,
palavra sua na face de uma estela futura.","the last roman poet
as waves break over the beaches
and cannons boom beyond the city walls,
he asks for one fleeting, indulgent hour
in an inviolable place,
shielded by the muse’s wings and the sibyl’s words
like an actor gone backstage.
forgetting the dream of a laurel-crowned head
and the couches that cradle the last epicurean souls,
he longs only for adverbial quiet – not a sound –
in which all might be preserved, in the ambit of his art,
with the lightness of a quill passing over paper.
that each word, purified, rolling on the tongue
like a host, might have the authority of a garland
or royal seal
and press the world he knew into a hedge
as everything degenerates and collapses around him.
in this work of falconry applied to time past,
writing reminds him of the notches the prisoner
cuts in the wall of his cell to count the days,
knowing what will come: the slipknot of the gallows
or a shot fired straight into his brain.

assomas no arco da porta com teu rosto de cera
e seguras o colar num gesto extravagante,
defendida de mais uma piada suburbana.
“espera-te o museu”, ia dizer, numa derrisão fatal.
a palavra é recolher sem perda de tempo
e tudo receber com uma última aclamação.

antigos, ébrios de sangue, chamando-nos

e a segurança, já o sabemos, é o teu sonho preferido,
se te debruças para os toldos e a linha da água.

que se acendem, inelutavelmente, na distância.

de olhar velado e face muda, inexpressiva,
recolhida, como estás, dentro de ti,
ao esconderijo mais abstruso de todos.

um ruído clamoroso na distância, olhamo-nos,
pois cumprida é a promessa, o sacramento
de ordem com que fomos investidos pelo tempo.

ou escavar em casa a galeria de mina,
desertando os dois, por um fuso horário,
na descida para os antípodas do mundo?
tomar um revulsivo ou deixarmo-nos ir,
movidos pelo vento, sob a aba dos telhados?
nada poderás levar, num último arrebatamento.
tu mesma serás presa, na tarde momentosa,
de quando foi desejo teu e perdes sem apelo
sob a lei da plebe ou uma qualquer ordem
pretoriana, sentenciada ao motivo bíblico
e à resignação de uma existência romana.
hoje tens só a imitação do teu rosto
no espelho. e nada mais te cumpre defender
à hora de sublevarem-se as obras de deus

you loom in the doorway with your waxen face,
flamboyantly clutching your necklace
like a shield against one more suburban joke.
“rehearsing for the museum?” i thought to shoot.
the order of the day is to retreat in haste
and to salute everything with a last hurrah.
drums are rolling, dear, as in olden times, drunk
with blood, calling us to the sacrificial rite.
there’s something ancestral and terrifying
about the face the television promises, look,
in the middle of its ominous harangue.
no comment. we don’t have kneeling pads
at home, and if you lean out to the umbrellas along
the shore, we know security is your preferred dream.
you go to the balcony as an eyewitness of the fires
inevitably blazing in the distance.
i see how fear chisels in you a statue
with veiled gaze and a speechless,
expressionless face, withdrawn into you,
the most recondite hiding place of all.

together now, happy if we hear a racket
in the distance, we look at each other,
for the promise is fulfilled, the ritual
sacrament conferred on us by time.
what should we do, you ask. hoist the sails
or dig a mine shaft in the floor, deserting
who we are as we descend time’s tunnel
to reach the world’s antipodes?
swallow a pill or let ourselves go,
pushed by the wind, beneath the eaves?
you cannot, in a final rapture, take anything.
you’ll be the prey, on that crucial day,
of all you desired and lose, without appeal,
under mob rule or some praetorian
order, sentenced to biblical logic
and the resignation of roman existence.

in the mirror. and that’s all you'll have to defend
in the hour when god's creation rebels (and beyond
your gaze – look! – there's still the whole world . . .).",pt_XX,en_XX,"de temporum fine comoedia

juntando a voz ao gemido comum. “ – quem é este?” –

"receita para fazer azul
se quiseres fazer azul,
pega num pedaço de céu e mete-o numa panela grande,
que possas levar ao lume do horizonte;
depois mexe o azul com um resto de vermelho
da madrugada, até que ele se desfaça;
despeja tudo num bacio bem limpo,
para que nada reste das impurezas da tarde.
por fim, peneira um resto de ouro da areia
do meio-dia, até que a cor pegue ao fundo de metal.
se quiseres, para que as cores se não desprendam
com o tempo, deita no líquido um caroço de pêssego queimado.
vê-lo-ás desfazer-se, sem deixar sinais de que alguma vez
ali o puseste; e nem o negro da cinza deixará um resto de ocre
na superfície dourada. podes, então, levantar a cor
até à altura dos olhos, e compará-la com o azul autêntico.
ambas as cores te parecerão semelhantes, sem que
possas distinguir entre uma e outra.

if you wish to make the colour blue
take a piece of sky and put it in a pot
large enough to place on the flame of the horizon.
stir into the blue a pinch of early morning red
until it dissolves. pour everything
into a brass bowl that has been well washed
to eliminate all of the afternoon’s impurities.
finally, sift in a few smidgens of gold from the sand
of midday until the colour adheres to the bottom of the bowl.
to prevent the colours from separating with time,

if you want to make blue,
take a piece of sky and put it in a large pan,
which you can place on the horizon's fire;
then mix the blue with a remnant of red
from dawn, until it dissolves;
pour everything into a very clean basin,
so that nothing remains of the afternoon's impurities.
finally, sift a remnant of gold from the sand
from midday, until the color sticks to the metal bottom.
if you want, so that the colors do not come off
over time, throw a burnt peach stone into the liquid.
you will see it dissolve, without leaving any sign that you ever
put it there; and not even the black of the ash will leave a trace of ochre
on the golden surface. You can then lift the color
up to eye level, and compare it with the real blue.
both colors will seem similar to you, without
you being able to distinguish one from the other. That’s what I did – I, Abraham Ben Judah Ibn Haim,

"das coisas
nem todas as coisas marcam para nós
o tempo com tenacidade, nos seus halos.
muitas ocultam ou não nos devolvem
o pensamento com que as havíamos querido.
ó coisa imaginada, reflexo na água,
ó tanque que conténs a história do tempo,
hora a hora nas quatro estações.
tens o inverno, o verão, a primavera
e sobretudo o outono perfeito, tão imóvel.
e o miósporo e a ameixoeira
não só te dão as imagens da imagem
como te lançam as pétalas soltas
para que o arquétipo tombe sobre a imagem.
e não apenas do reino vegetal as figuras
visitam o teu espelho, ó tanque antigo,
como os peixes, as aves e os insectos
passam, no inteiro tempo em que tu guardas
os sinais do passado e do presente.
tanta coisa passou sem me lembrar
que passamos, só esta água
parada no seu círculo e a escorrer
tem uma força móvel e imóvel
que me puxa de idade para idade.
continuamente jorra, e sai pela caleira
rasa ao chão, espalhada nos terrenos.
e o tempo vai-se gastando como a água
que nunca tem em si o mesmo espelho
para as imagens vindas e perdidas.","on things

you have winter, summer and spring
to show, and perfect, motionless autumn.
the plum tree and the windstay bush
give you not only images of the image
but also their fallen petals,
so that the archetype overlies the image.
and not only from the plant kingdom,
o ancient tank, do figures visit your mirror;
fishes, birds and insects pass
in the whole time where you preserve
the signs of the past and present.
so many things have passed, and yet i forget
that we pass, that only this water
enclosed in its circle and flowing
has a mobile and immobile force
that pulls me from age to age.
