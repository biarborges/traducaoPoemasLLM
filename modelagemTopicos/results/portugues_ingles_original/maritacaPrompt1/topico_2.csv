at peace with myself.
now i see the great harm

disillusion costs dearly:
so costly was my latest
disillusion, it didn’t kill me.

in sorrow after sorrow,
cruelly sent my way.

have taken ahold of me.

very dear it cost me

what can i be sure of?
rather dubious hopes,

i wave on these disillusions
in my long, useless illusion.

a different set of concerns.

unaware of what they risk.",pt_XX,en_XX,"Amidst so much change

"amar!
eu quero amar, amar perdidamente!
amar só por amar: aqui... além...
mais este e aquele, o outro e toda a gente
amar! amar! e não amar ninguém!
recordar? esquecer? indiferente!...
prender ou desprender? é mal? é bem?
quem disser que se pode amar alguém
durante a vida inteira é porque mente!
há uma primavera em cada vida:
é preciso cantá-la assim florida,
pois se deus nos deu voz, foi pra cantar!
e se um dia hei-de ser pó, cinza e nada
que seja a minha noite uma alvorada,
que me saiba perder... pra me encontrar...","to love!

to love just to love: here... there...

everyone! to love and not love anyone!
remember? forget? it’s all the same!...
hold on or let go? wrong? or right?
those who say they can love someone
their whole life long are telling a lie!
there is in every life a spring.
when it flowers, it must be sung.
the voice god gave us is for singing!

nothing, then let my night be a dawn
and let me be lost... to find myself...",pt_XX,en_XX,"To love!

I want to love, to love recklessly!
To love just for the sake of love: here... there...

Bind or loosen? Is it wrong? Is it right?
Whoever says you can love someone
For the whole life is lying!

There is a spring in every life:
It's necessary to sing it in full bloom,
For if God gave us voice, it's to sing!

And if one day I am to be dust, ashes and nothingness,
That my night becomes a dawn,
That I know how to lose myself... to find myself...",2
"a necessidade
uma porta fechada não é suficiente para que o homem
esconda o seu amor. ele também necessita de uma porta aberta
para poder partir e se perder na multidão quando esse amor explodir
como o barril de pólvora no arsenal alcançado pelo raio.
um telhado não basta para que o homem se proteja
do calor e da tempestade. para fugir ao relâmpago
ele precisa de um corpo estendido na cama
e ao alcance de sua mão ainda temerosa
de avançar no excuro quando a chuva cai no silêncio do mundo aberto como uma fruta
entre dios estrondos.
na noite que declina, no dia que nasce,
o homem precisa de tudo: do amor e do raio.","necessities
a closed door is not enough for a man
to hide his love. he also needs an open door
so he can leave and lose himself in the crowd when that love explodes
like a barrel of powder in the arsenal hit by lightning.

from heat and storm. to flee the thunderbolt
he needs a body stretched out in bed
and within reach of his hand still afraid
to advance in the dark as the rain falls on the silence of the world open like a fruit
between two thunderclaps.

man needs it all: love and the lightning bolt.",pt_XX,en_XX,"The need

"extrema-unção

surfacing in the eyes, a distant disappointment,

for making us lose time.

and, hovering above us, you waited
for us to say it all, and do what needed to be done.
dying is no reason to be proud,
but you were too exhausted to explain yourself.

vacations set, relatives already gone.

with freshly laundered sheets. nothing missing, but your death.",pt_XX,en_XX,"last rites

floral gaze, a distant letdown,

for wasting our time.

for us to say everything, to do what's appropriate.

with vacations planned, family absent.

our love. then i’d be ruined, since i love only you.

you’re pursuing another lover. so i detach
myself, believing your retribution will match
the sacrificial depths my love has cost:

never to try to be happy again.

i mourn the past in whatever i say,
as each day passes, step by step;

that not for an hour in so long a life
could i give evil so much as a side step!
surely, i’m better dead than alive?
why complain, at last? what’s more to say,
having failed to be cheated by my own eyes?

whose absence caused me as much pain

you should keep the burning ray alive

must advance to close these sad eyes

in writing of so troublesome a life

i envisage a sad version of life
that places no value on such eyes,
i cannot conceive how such pain
could find a pen to declare i’m alive.

if they found no relief in what i say
they would now have made ashes of my pain;
but beyond this grief i overstep,
i’m softened by the tears of those eyes

Not a single hour has been so long a life
in which to move from this evil by a step.
What's the use of being alive rather than dead?
For what do I weep? For what do I speak,
if I could not hold onto my eyes?
O fair, gentle, and bright eyes,
your absence moves me to such sorrow
as cannot be comprehended while I speak!
If, at the end of such a long and short life,
your living ray still inflamed me,
then everything I've endured would have been worthwhile.
But I know, that before the final step
it will come to close my sad eyes
that love will not show those for whom I live.
The ink and pen shall be witnesses,
that wrote of such a grievous life
the least of what I've passed, and the most of what I speak.
Oh! I do not know what I write, nor what I speak!
That from one thought to another step,
I see such a sad kind of life
that, if it is not aided by so many eyes,
I cannot imagine what is the pain
that translates this pain with which I live.
In my soul I constantly bear a living fire,
which, if it did not breathe in what I speak,
the pen would already be ash;
but, above the greatest pain that I suffer and endure,
my tears from my eyes
with which fleeing, life does not end.
I am dying in life,
and in death I live;
I see without eyes,
and without tongue I speak;
and I simultaneously pass
glory and pain.",2
"oh! como se me alonga, de ano em ano,
a peregrinação cansada minha!
como se encurta, e como ao fim caminha
este meu breve e vão discurso humano!
vai-se gastando a idade e cresce o dano;
perde-se-me um remédio, que inda tinha;
se por experiência se adivinha,
qualquer grande esperança é grande engano.
corro após este bem que não se alcança;
no meio do caminho me falece,
mil vezes caio, e perco a confiança.

se os olhos ergo a ver se inda parece,
da vista se me perde e da esperança.","oh how long, year after year . . .

how short a space until my brief
and useless human rambling ends!
time wastes away and my ruin increases;
a remedy i used to have is gone.
if we can judge from past experience,
every large hope is a grand illusion.
i chase some good that can’t be had:
when halfway there, i’ve lost the trail;
falling a thousand times, i despair.
it flees, i lag; and if, in my lagging,
i look up to see if it’s still there,
it’s lost from sight and lost from hope.",pt_XX,en_XX,"Oh! how my weary pilgrimage grows,
year after year, more long and more slow!

approaching its end, its course does reach!

a remedy I lose, which I did boast;
if by experience one does forecast,
any great hope is found to be a woe.
I run after this good that cannot be caught;
in the middle of the path, it's lost;
I fall a thousand times, and faith is smote.
when it escapes, I linger; and, in delay,
if I my eyes uplift to see if it's still in sight,
from vision and hope it's gone, out of sight.",2
