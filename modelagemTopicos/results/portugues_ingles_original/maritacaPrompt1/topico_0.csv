não há lugares, nunca houve, nem mesmo antigos.

places don’t exist, never existed, not even the ancient ones.
what exists is what we see in them, the brick dust traces making them vanish.
only thus we’ll land. lightly, just for the remembrance.
not in order to touch the lilac columns or go across on the tangerine sailing boat.
only vaguely we progress. we don’t walk under the sun.
the nomads’ feet are not blackened by the sand and the sea in small ports.
the elms shelter us, not the terraces.
the dust traces bruise us with a faint drop
we can wile between our fingers and still it doesn’t solidify.

taking us along the mediterranean horizon are our eyes,

There are no places, never were, not even ancient ones.
There's what we look at them, their dust-stone imprint that makes them vanish.
Only this way we manage to arrive. Only softly, to remember.
Not to touch the lilac columns or cross in the orange boat.
We only wander vaguely. We don't walk, beneath the sun.
The nomads' feet don't darken with the sands and the waters of small ports.
It's the elm trees that protect us, not their terraces.
The dust imprint marks us in a faded drop,
we can entertain it even between our fingers, it doesn't petrify.
Nothing has changed since the first complaint; it was
with our eyes that we set out along the Mediterranean line
and the olive trees are its diurnal limit.",0
"nada existe que não tivesse começado.
mesmo na lonjura, decisiva porção iluminada,
em territórios despojados de todo o fim, em
areais de mares a desaguar desconhecidamente,
mais não olhamos senão a extensão do que vimos.
se campos da livónia vão dar a campos da mazúria,
se mosaicos amaciam na água de banhos mornos,
e além houver só cemitérios seguindo cemitérios, e
a meio deles, parado sem vento, o bosque de bétulas,
se o sol é o lume do azeite a esmiolar o pão
ou o clarão lascado nas muralhas de helsingør,
se o enredo da morte é igual em toda a parte,
seja na flauta de santa maria ou no gaiteiro de tallinn,
é porque modulamos num lugar o que lastrou de outro.
mesmo sem querer, ou sejam sombras afastando-se,
mais não tecemos que a linha de acasos e acertos
que uma corrente conduz, a cada um, em separado,
à passagem mais sensível do acabamento.
mesmo isolando os lugares numa função laboriosa,
detalhando as suas divergências, e as pontas extremas
— a parecença entre o que são e o que pensámos serem,
mesmo nas regiões cruzadas por comboios extensos,
onde a noite cairá em escamas de lavanda,
seguiremos a mesma história — afundamos os pés no mesmo solo.
naquilo por que vamos repetidamente levados,
ansiando o que se manifeste acolá na próxima enseada,
alisando com a mão os castanheiros onde inscrevemos, depois
de outros, nossos sinuosos nomes, nossos amores,
sempre tornamos ao ponto em que tudo se repete e inicia,
de que atingimos apenas um minuto só — um instante,
a lâmina que medeia o ano que passa e o ano que vem.","nothing exists that hasn’t had a beginning.
nothing exists that hasn’t had a beginning.
even in the distance, a clear lit speck,
in territories stripped from all limits, on
sands that flow from unknown seas,
we only contemplate the extent of what we perceived.
if fields in livonia lead to fields in masuria,
if tiles are smoothed in tepid bath waters,
and further on graveyard follows graveyard, and
in their midst, inert in the lack of wind, the birch wood stands,
if the sun is the flame of the olive oil crumbling the bread
or the chipped lightening on the walls of helsingør,
if the death plot is everywhere the same,
be it in the santa maria flute or in the tallinn concertina
it is because we modulate in one place what has seeped from another.
even unwillingly, or perhaps it’s the shadows on the move,
we weave no more than a row of chances and discretions
along a current which takes each one of us, separately,
to the most sensitive final passage.
even if laboriously we detach the places,
detailing their diversions and extremes
— the similarity between what they are and what we thought they were,
even throughout regions intersected by extensive trains,
where night will fall in scales of lavender,
we’ll follow the same story — we sink our feet in the same mud.
in that which repeatedly sucks us in,
as we yearn for whatever comes to pass further in the next cove
smoothing with our hands the oak trees on whose bark we inscribe,
like others before us, our sinuous names, our loves,
we constantly return to the point where all is repeated and begun,
of which we grasp a mere minute — an instant,
the blade mediating between this year and the next.",pt_XX,en_XX,"Nothing exists that had not begun.
Even in the distance, a decisive portion illuminated,
in territories stripped of all end, on
sandbanks where seas flow into the unknown,
we look no further than the extension of what we see.
Whether fields of livonia lead to fields of masuria,
whether mosaics soften in the warm bathwater,
and beyond there are only cemeteries following cemeteries, and
at their center, motionless without wind, the birch forest,
whether the sun is the oil flame to split the bread
or the flash struck from the ramparts of helsingør,
whether the plot of death is the same everywhere,
whether in the flute of santa maria or the piper from tallinn,
it is because we play a tune in one place that another is weighed down.
Even without wanting, or whether shadows receding,
we weave nothing but the line of chance and accuracy
that a chain leads, to each one, in isolation,
to the most sensitive passage of completion.
Even isolating places in a laborious function,
detailing their divergences, and the extreme ends
— the resemblance between what they are and what we thought they were,
even in regions crossed by long trains,
where the night will fall in lavender scales,
we will follow the same story — we sink our feet into the same ground.
In what repeatedly drives us,
yearning for what manifests over there in the next cove,
smooth with our hand the chestnut trees where, after others,
we inscribe our winding names, our loves,
we always return to the point where everything repeats and begins,
which we reach only for a minute — an instant,
the blade that mediates the year that passes and the year that comes.",0

"tempo circular
na sombra das folhas de nossos passos
sob um manto de nuvens o dia escureceu; o outono
gerou e apagou novas e efémeras
constelações, e à janela, olhando os cumes nevados ao
longe envoltos no orvalho de um doce sofrimento,
nossos olhos envelheceram; as nossas lembranças e aqueles
que amámos teceram palavras esquecidas; e a vida,
seguindo e caindo sem fim, pareceu apagar-se
como espuma numa recordação fugaz, um bloco de gelo,
transparente, esculpindo e transformando os aspectos do tempo ou
que os gansos agarravam com as asas as frágeis
penas do seu ser, as faziam estilhaçar.
mas era justamente por os anos passados pesarem
sobre nós, voltarem, ou desaparerem, que as terras e os
vales se sentia que suspiravam, que marcavam grãos de areia
no rosto, como outrora em connemara; que se sentia que a natureza
estava prestes a transformar-se, que a nossa sombra estava
prestes a desaparecer; que a neve caía, ia caindo, a neve dos teixos
deixando passar a neve; e que o inverno chegava com
as suas raízes escoradas pela água, e que a ronda do ano
dava outra volta fortuita na charneca, outra volta
na primavera e no verão; outro sopro do seu espírito, como um
gerânio que as pétalas desenham num curso incessante, invisível, e caíssem
na cratera da inocência, dos que vivem, dos que morrem.","circular time
in the leafed shadows of our footsteps
under a mantle of cloud, the day darkened; autumn
crafted and wiped out new and ephemeral
constellations, and by the window, reaching out to distant
snow dusted peaks robed in sweet suffering dew,

we loved weaved a forgotten word; and life,
ever returning, and ever falling, seemed to vanish

transparent, shaping and changing the faces of time, or
like a shattering of fragile wings, were the geese
to try and grab it in full flight.
but it was precisely because the passing of the years
weighing on us was coming back or disappearing, that the lands and
the valleys were heard sighing, were allowed to leave the grains of sand

seemed to be about to transform, our shadow was
about to disappear; the snow was falling, kept falling, the yew snow
letting the snow through; and winter arrived with
its roots dipped in water, and the turn of the year
went yet fortuitously round the heath,
through spring, and summer; another breath of its spirit like

That the geese caught with their wings the fragile
Feathers of their being, made them shatter.

About to disappear; that the snow fell, was falling, the snow of the hollies
Letting the snow pass; and that winter came with
Its roots supported by water, and that the round of the year
Gave another fortuitous turn on the moor, another turn
In spring and summer; another breath of its spirit, like a
Geranium whose petals draw an endless, invisible course, and fell
Into the crater of innocence, of the living, of the dying.",0

na hora em que eu mais ruía
o sol aplainava o relvado, palmeiras
ondulavam num lago turvo
longe o escaravelho porvindoiro
que as reduziu a um coto
assemelhando-as a um ananás que degrada hoje
pelos jardins
o repuxo animava sem triunfo o pântano
da juventude
as varandas em fogo
o verão começando pelo fim
horas extraordinárias aquelas
em que as aves adiavam o repouso por causa
dos insectos do turno sequente
ourados absortos estrepitantes
a hora em que mais ninguém deitava como eu
a bicicleta sobre a falta
e se sentava na relva prendendo as lágrimas
as mãos tapando o rosto o rosto entre os geolhos e uma
roda atrás a girar
não havia o ecrã de bolso oportuno
era inevitável encarar o que não tem conserto
nem nunca terá
era do dia o instante altíloquo
uma harmónica crepitava nos auscultadores
feria de morte o touro da tarde
esse búfalo ermo que se aparta da manada
para ficar-se
os subidos candeeiros acendiam
havia um muro recém pintado
sujo já por um grafito de província
um cão passava ao largo levantava o focinho ao
perfume dos jantares
que chegava de onde
se entrevia o espalha-cor dos televisores
havia o farrapo de lua
como flanela posta sobre a ganga das alturas
agraudava os dós arrumados
na caixa do futuro
a hédera das extensões percorria aquela hora
uma ideia sulcava a charneca celeste
o coração alpinista no avesso dos volumes
rarefeito
o mundo era já uma seara de nojo
e fartura – belo desastroso feroz – lugar de forças
e destruições
eu tacteava de olhos fechados
puro intrínseco
procurava um celeiro urbano onde guardar
o ouro-sémen pronto a detonar
a libélula extrema o grilo inicial
a andorinha cujo ninho resulta de um cúmulo
de lama e ervas secas e rasoira

nas minhas costas o exíguo refrigério
da biblioteca pública

repousando da luta de guerrilha

that moment when i was really falling apart
and the sun lingered over the lawn, and the palms
billowed above the turbid lake
faraway the promised beetle
reduced those palms to a stump
until they seemed like a pineapple which these days
rots in the gardens
the fountain blandly animated the swamp

the balconies on fire

in which the birds delayed their naps because
of the next shift of insects

the surfaces feeding itself in the air

but reluctant enemy

sacudimos o que sobrou do gozo
o pequeno lumaréu que à boca do abrigo
longas frias horas crepitou
atufamos mochilas
testados couros e ataduras
aprumados os cabelos
levamos aos dentes um pouco de farinha
fiapos de carne seca
tragos de café fumegante
nós, soldadas de alexandre
a quem o whiskey dos serões jamais tombou
e as botas não pesam
nem vexam as febres
o rectângulo onde a tenda demorou
ficará por um tempo assinalado no gazão
com as pedras a rodear o que foi
a labareda cintilante que depois negrejou
e é pasto para o faro da medrosa
fauna que virá
sondar esta parte sujada do lugar
por essa altura o nosso odor
planará por ravinas desfiladeiros
misturado com o pó e o estrépito dos cascos com que
erramos à beira dos abismos
produziremos ecos de que o nosso pudor
se acanhará
mas por dentro – tácitas mais que a estorga
dos penhascos –
e duras, róridas, raras
abaulando a vista sobre os mapas
destapando bússolas
tirando pequenas notas sobre o rumo

i’m watching her:
sweet the alp in the angle of her jaw
when she wakes
the canvas soaked at dawn
the grass outside darkens just as the sun rising
dilutes sleep
the mules feed off the fleeting
boreal pastures
before us a way opens up
luminously
glued to keeping quiet
to moving
but a breeze already inflames
making us want for a lake, placing
a range on the horizon
a less uncrossable elevation
than the lowlands of lived life
we say goodbye to the humid moss
fingered between thighs
stir the last pleasure out of the little
campfire that crackled
at the shelter’s opening through the long cold hours
we stuff rucksacks
leather and straps tested
we fixed our hair
munch a bit of flour
shredded bits of jerky
swigs of steaming coffee
we, the soldiers of alexander
whom nights of whiskey never fell
whose boots don’t weigh a thing
nor shame the fevers
the rectangle left by the tent
will remain for a while marking the plot of grass
stones ringing what had been
a scintillating flame later gone dark
now pasture to the scent of the timid
animals that will wander in
sounding out this sullied bit of the scene
at this very moment our scent
sails through narrow ravines
mixed with the dust and the clamor of hoofs that brings us
straying close on the edge of precipices
our own echoing
will embarrass us
but within – more silence even than the gorse
on the cliff sides –
and hardened, soaked with mist, atypical
arching over our maps
opening compasses
jotting quick notes about the way
and the error
more goat than us more mountainous: life
this leather hard to tan",pt_XX,en_XX,"Annemarie Schwarzenbach

I look at her:
sweet the vertex at the angle of the jaw
when she awakens
the canvas has soaked in the dawn
outside the grass tints as much as the rising star
dilutes the sleep
the mules graze the northern pastures of phantoms
before us a path articulates
illuminating
attached to the silence
to the movement
but already a breath inflames
returns us the desire of a lake, sets
on the horizon the mountain range
elevation less insurmountable
than the plain of the lived
we bid farewell to the moss heard
typed between thighs
we shake off what remains of pleasure
the small luminary that at the mouth of the shelter
long cold hours crackled
we stuff our backpacks
tested leather and bandages
straightened hair
we carry to our teeth a bit of flour
bits of dried meat
puffs of steaming coffee
we, soldiers of Alexander
to whom the whiskey of the evenings never fainted
and the boots do not weigh
nor fevers shame
the rectangle where the tent lingered
will be for a time marked on the lawn
with the stones surrounding what was
the flickering flame that then darkened
and is pasture for the timid
fauna that will come
to probe this soiled part of the place
by this time our odor
will hover over ravines and gorges
mixed with the dust and the clatter of hooves with which
we wandered the edge of the abyss
we will produce echoes of which our modesty
will be embarrassed
but inside – more silent than the thongs
of the cliffs –
and hard, dewy, rare
swelling the view over the maps
uncovering compasses
taking small notes on the route

metade solar outra metade
adentrada na noite que divide e reparte irmãmente os dois
pedaços da mesma ideia:
redonda achatada nos polos insegura no seu tombo
escuridão afora
a cabeça pendular metida entre ombros
sombras
na órbita do absurdo a cumprir a curvatura que lhe cabe
errando distorcendo a silenciosa
nitidez dos hemisférios

de visíveis

onde uma língua lambe partículas, intenta locuções
ou a mudez dos vaga-lumes

partindo do centro, desalcançando

veloz rebobinado, o retroverso inteiro, e vejamos passar
pelo buraco de uma agulha o camelo
do raciocínio

resplandece muito como se às mãos um lume
viesse entreter as trevas

queimando as ervas
enterrando os sinais
inclinando a esfera do pensamento para a água

menos nítidas

é no sossego de um quarto extinto rumoroso
que a nossa esfera abate na mole dos seus fantasmas

floco de neve ampliado uma magnólia floresce e floresce

arrefece na lâmpada do tecto

órfãs do disjuntor

half solar the other half
plunged in night that divides and fraternally shares two
scraps of the same idea:
round flattened at the poles insecure in its fall
out of darkness
the pendular head sunk between shoulders
shadows
the orbit of the absurd fulfilling its incumbent curvature
wandering distorting the silent
clarity of hemispheres
festooned in eyes of beryl, orifices, surrounded
by visibilities
panoramas breaking off that linger
long afterwards, coiling
a game of veiling and unveiling on the rooftop terrace
of events
where a tongue licks particles, proffers phrases
or the muteness of fireflies
but everything scatters from everything else
even though we thrust an arm into the void
out from the center, it’s thwarted
and everything crashes, velocious
mobile rewinding, an utter retroversion, and we can see
the camel of reason
pass through the eye of a needle
and it snows in this geometry
such
resplendence really as though a flame were handed to us
to fill the darkness
this is how we are upon the the face of the earth
burning the weeds
burying the signs
tipping the sphere of thinking into the water
each year we go down a series of narrow paths
ever dimmer
inundated, sleep is submerged under nocturnal weight
the body shudders with anonymity
it’s in the calm of a room humming with death
that our sphere falls into its crowd of ghosts
the ceiling opens on the celestial fire
on a different, a singular clarity
and in this emptiness, this opening, in this
high burgeoning snowflake a magnolia blooms and blooms
the immense sequoia of the world retires
to its dominion
while dimensions of fear and crap cool in their own venue
the naked bulb in the middle of the ceiling
the orphan waves of the circuit breaker are hushed
in hidden complexities
attend to fable-like vibrations beyond evidence

into its power

nas nossas ruas, ao anoitecer,
há tal soturnidade, há tal melancolia,
que as sombras, o bulício, o tejo, a maresia
despertam-me um desejo absurdo de sofrer.
o céu parece baixo e de neblina,
o gás extravasado enjoa-me, perturba;
e os edifícios, com as chaminés, e a turba
toldam-se duma cor monótona e londrina.
batem carros de aluguer, ao fundo,
levando à via-férrea os que se vão. felizes!
ocorrem-me em revista exposições, países:
madrid, paris, berlim, s. petersburgo, o mundo!
semelham-se a gaiolas, com viveiros,
as edificações somente emadeiradas:
como morcegos, ao cair das badaladas,
saltam de viga em viga os mestres carpinteiros.
voltam os calafates, aos magotes,
de jaquetão ao ombro, enfarruscados, secos;
embrenho-me, a cismar, por boqueirões, por becos,
ou erro pelos cais a que se atracam botes.
e evoco, então, as crónicas navais:
mouros, baixéis, heróis, tudo ressuscitado!
luta camões no sul, salvando um livro a nado!
singram soberbas naus que eu não verei jamais!
e o fim da tarde inspira-me; e incomoda!
de um couraçado inglês vogam os escaleres;
e em terra num tinir de louças e talheres
flamejam, ao jantar alguns hotéis da moda.
num trem de praça arengam dois dentistas;
um trôpego arlequim braceja numas andas;
os querubins do lar flutuam nas varandas;
às portas, em cabelo, enfadam-se os lojistas!
vazam-se os arsenais e as oficinas;
reluz, viscoso, o rio, apressam-se as obreiras;
e num cardume negro, hercúleas, galhofeiras,
correndo com firmeza, assomam as varinas.
vêm sacudindo as ancas opulentas!
seus troncos varonis recordam-me pilastras;
e algumas, à cabeça, embalam nas canastras
os filhos que depois naufragam nas tormentas.
descalças! nas descargas de carvão,
desde manhã à noite, a bordo das fragatas;
e apinham-se num bairro aonde miam gatas,
e o peixe podre gera os focos de infecção!

toca-se às grades, nas cadeias. som
que mortifica e deixa umas loucuras mansas!
o aljube, em que hoje estão velhinhas e crianças,
bem raramente encerra uma mulher de “dom”!
e eu desconfio, até, de um aneurisma
tão mórbido me sinto, ao acender das luzes;
à vista das prisões, da velha sé, das cruzes,
chora-me o coração que se enche e que se abisma.
a espaços, iluminam-se os andares,
e as tascas, os cafés, as tendas, os estancos
alastram em lençol os seus reflexos brancos;
e a lua lembra o circo e os jogos malabares.
duas igrejas, num saudoso largo,
lançam a nódoa negra e fúnebre do clero:
nelas esfumo um ermo inquisidor severo,
assim que pela história eu me aventuro e alargo.
na parte que abateu no terremoto,
muram-me as construções rectas, iguais, crescidas;
afrontam-me, no resto, as íngremes subidas,
e os sinos dum tanger monástico e devoto.
mas, num recinto público e vulgar,
com bancos de namoro e exíguas pimenteiras,
brônzeo, monumental, de proporções guerreiras,
um épico doutrora ascende, num pilar!
e eu sonho o cólera, imagino a febre,
nesta acumulação de corpos enfezados;
sombrios e espectrais recolhem os soldados;
inflama-se um palácio em face de um casebre.
partem patrulhas de cavalaria
dos arcos dos quartéis que foram já conventos;
idade média! a pé, outras, a passos lentos,
derramam-se por toda a capital, que esfria.
triste cidade! eu temo que me avives
uma paixão defunta! aos lampiões distantes,
enlutam-me, alvejando, as tuas elegantes,
curvadas a sorrir às montras dos ourives.
e mais: as costureiras, as floristas
descem dos magasins, causam-me sobressaltos;
custa-lhes a elevar os seus pescoços altos
e muitas delas são comparsas ou coristas.

eu acho sempre assunto a quadros revoltados:
entro na brasserie; às mesas de emigrados,
ao riso e à crua luz joga-se o dominó.

passeios de lajedo arrastam-se as impuras.

um sopro que arripia os ombros quase nus.
cercam-me as lojas, tépidas. eu penso
ver círios laterais, ver filas de capelas,
com santos e fiéis, andores, ramos, velas,
em uma catedral de um comprimento imenso.
as burguesinhas do catolicismo
resvalam pelo chão minado pelos canos;
e lembram-me, ao chorar doente dos pianos,
as freiras que os jejuns matavam de histerismo.
num cutileiro, de avental, ao torno,
um forjador maneja um malho, rubramente;
e de uma padaria exala-se, inda quente,
um cheiro salutar e honesto a pão no forno.
e eu que medito um livro que exacerbe,
quisera que o real e a análise mo dessem;
casas de confecções e modas resplandecem;
pelas vitrines olha um ratoneiro imberbe.
longas descidas! não poder pintar
com versos magistrais, salubres e sinceros,
a esguia difusão dos vossos reverberos,
e a vossa palidez romântica e lunar!
que grande cobra, a lúbrica pessoa,
que espartilhada escolhe uns xales com debuxo!
sua excelência atrai, magnética, entre luxo,
que ao longo dos balcões de mogno se amontoa.
e aquela velha, de bandós! por vezes,
a sua traîne imita um leque antigo, aberto,
nas barras verticais, a duas tintas. perto,
escarvam, à vitória, os seus mecklemburgueses.
desdobram-se tecidos estrangeiros;
plantas ornamentais secam nos mostradores;
flocos de pós de arroz pairam sufocadores,
e em nuvens de cetins requebram-se os caixeiros.
mas tudo cansa! apagam-se nas frentes
os candelabros, como estrelas, pouco a pouco;
da solidão regouga um cauteleiro rouco;
tornam-se mausoléus as armações fulgentes.

pede-me esmola um homenzinho idoso,
meu velho professor nas aulas de latim!

por baixo, que portões! que arruamentos!
um parafuso cai nas lajes, às escuras:
colocam-se taipais, rangem as fechaduras,
e os olhos dum caleche espantam-me, sangrentos.
e eu sigo, como as linhas de uma pauta
a dupla correnteza augusta das fachadas;
pois sobem, no silêncio, infaustas e trinadas,
as notas pastoris de uma longínqua flauta.
se eu não morresse, nunca! e eternamente
buscasse e conseguisse a perfeição das cousas!
esqueço-me a prever castíssimas esposas,
que aninhem em mansões de vidro transparente!
ó nossos filhos! que de sonhos ágeis,
pousando, vos trarão a nitidez às vidas!
eu quero as vossas mães e irmãs estremecidas,
numas habitações translúcidas e frágeis.
ah! como a raça ruiva do porvir,
e as frotas dos avós, e os nómadas ardentes,
nós vamos explorar todos os continentes
e pelas vastidões aquáticas seguir!
mas se vivemos, os emparedados,
sem árvores, no vale escuro das muralhas!...
julgo avistar, na treva, as folhas das navalhas
e os gritos de socorro ouvir estrangulados.
e nestes nebulosos corredores
nauseiam-me, surgindo, os ventres das tabernas;
na volta, com saudade, e aos bordos sobre as pernas,
cantam, de braço dado, uns tristes bebedores.
eu não receio, todavia, os roubos;
afastam-se, a distância, os dúbios caminhantes;
e sujos, sem ladrar, ósseos, febris, errantes,
amareladamente, os cães parecem lobos.
e os guardas, que revistam as escadas,
caminham de lanterna e servem de chaveiros;
por cima, as imorais, nos seus roupões ligeiros,

vespers
when evening falls across our streets
and sullen melancholy fills the air,
the tagus, the tang, the shadows and bustle
bring me an absurd desire to suffer.
the sky hangs low and seems all hazy;
the gas from the streetlamps makes me queasy;
the tumult of buildings, chimneys and people
is cloaked in a dullish, londonish hue.
oh lucky travellers in hired coaches
now hieing to the railway station! countries
and exhibitions file past me: madrid,
paris, berlin, st petersburg, the world!
the timber frames of future buildings
resemble cages for keeping animals;
like swooping bats the carpenters leap
from beam to beam at the sound of the bell.
clusters of callous, tar-smeared caulkers
return from the slipways, coats on their shoulders;
i wander through alleys that lead to the river
or walk by the wharves where boats are docked.
i evoke the ocean chronicles: the moors,
old vessels and heroes – all resurrected!
shipwrecked camões swims his book to shore! (1)
great carracks that i’ll never see ride the waves!
the twilight inspires, and also disturbs me!
an english battleship launches its cutters
while swank hotels on land bedazzle
with china and flatware clinking at dinner.
two dentists argue inside a streetcar;
a clumsy clown is struggling on stilts;
children flit, like cherubs, on balconies;
hatless, bored shopkeepers wait at their doors!
the shipyards and workshops are emptying out;
the river glints thickly, the workwomen hurry;
and a black school of herculean fishwives
bursts out of nowhere, joking, laughing.
wagging sumptuous hips they come!
their manly torsos remind me of pillars;
and some, in the baskets on their heads,
rock sons who’ll one day drown in storms.
on frigates – barefoot! – they unload coal (2)
from dawn to dusk, then crowd together
in a neighbourhood where cats meow
and the rotting fish breed infection!
ii
after dark
prisoners bang on the bars of their cells –
a sound that rattles my nerves with shame!
the aljube jail, for old women and children,
rarely encloses a titled lady!
i feel so ill as the lights come on
i worry i might have an aneurysm;
the sight of the jails, crosses, cathedral,
fills and sinks my heart with tears.
one floor after another lights up,
and cafés, restaurants, tobacco and other shops
spread like a sheet their white reflections.
the moon brings jugglers, the circus, to mind.
on an ancient square two churches raise
the clergy’s black, funereal spectre;
i sketch there a lonely, dour inquisitor,
daring to extend myself into history.
in quarters which the earthquake flattened
equal, straight buildings wall me in; (3)
everywhere else i face steep streets
and the tolling of pious, monastic bells.
but gracing a common, public square
with lovers’ benches and lithe pepper trees
a war-sized monument cast in bronze
stands, on a pillar, for an epic that was! (4)
and in this assemblage of stunted bodies
i think of the fever, imagine the cholera;
returning soldiers look sombre as ghosts;
a gleaming palace stands opposite a hovel.
mounted patrolmen set out from the archways
of army barracks that once were convents;
the middle ages! others, on foot,
range through the capital, now turning cold.
sad town! i dread you’ll arouse a dead passion
in me! i mourn upon seeing your elegant
ladies so white in the lamp-lit distance,
leaning and smiling at jewellers’ windows.
coming down from the department stores,
the florists and dressmakers wrench my gut;
they’re hardly able to hold up their heads,
and many are walk-ons and chorus girls.
even in sordid human tableaus
i, with my pince-nez, find subject matter:
i enter the beerhouse; at the immigrants’ tables,
harshly lit, they laugh and play dominoes.
iii
by gaslight
and i go back out. the night’s weight crushes.
impure women roam the sidewalks.
o languid hospitals! ill-clad shoulders
shiver from drafts where streets open up.
warm shops surround me. i think i’m seeing
flanking candles, rows of chapels
with saints and the faithful, flowers, more candles,
more saints, in a vastly long cathedral.
the bourgeois women of catholicism
slip on the ground that’s tunnelled by drainpipes.
to me they recall, with their whining pianos,
the nuns who, fasting, died of madness.
an aproned knife maker, working the lathe,
redhotly wields his blacksmith’s hammer;
and bread, still warm, from the baker’s oven
sends forth its honest, wholesome smell.
and i, whose goal is a book that galls,
want it to show and examine what’s real.
boutiques shine with the latest fashions;
a street urchin gapes at their window displays.
o long descents! could i but paint
with skilled, sincere, salubrious verses
the delicate shimmering of your streetlamps
and all your romantic moonlit pallor!
that sensual, corseted creature selecting
printed shawls – she moves like a snake!
her excellence is a magnet amidst
the finery piled on mahogany counters.
and that old dame with coiled plaits!
her train with its vertical, two-tone stripes
mocks a spread fan! her mecklenburg horses
wait with the carriage, pawing the pavement.
decorative plants wilt on the tables
where clerks unroll their foreign fabrics;
in clouds of satins they bow and smile;
rice powder hovers and chokes the air.
but all grows weary! slowly, like stars,
the storefronts’ hanging lights go dim;
the glittering buildings become mausoleums;
a lone, hoarse voice hawks lottery tickets.
and there on a corner: “please, sir! take pity!”
whenever i pass him, that little old man,
bald and eternal, begs for alms:
the teacher at school who taught me latin!
iv
the dead hours
the lofty ceiling of air, of oxygen,
runs between the facing rooftops;
the stars’ tired eyes shed tears of light;
blue dreams of transmigration exalt me.
below all that, what portals! what streets!
i hear, in the dark, a screw hit the ground,
the clacking of shutters, the jangle of locks;
and the bloodshot eyes of a buggy scare me.
i follow, like lines on a music stave,
the stately double row of façades
while pastoral notes from a distant flute
trill, in the silence, a gloomy warning.
oh, if i’d never die! if forever
i’d seek and attain the perfection of things!
i lose myself envisioning wives
who chastely nest in clear-glass mansions!
dear sons! what swift dreams, alighting,
will bring sharp clarity to your lives!
i want the mothers and sisters you love
to live in luminous, fragile homes.
ah! like our grandfathers’ fleets, like fervent
nomads, like the ruddy race to come, (5)
we’ll go and explore every continent
and sail across the watery expanses!
but how, if we live enclosed by stone
in a dark and treeless valley of walls?
i think i see knives flash in the shadows
and hear a strangled cry for help.
and along these murky corridors
the taverns, if i peer in, appall me.
some sorry drunks are staggering home
and sing, arms joined, for old time’s sake.
but i’m not afraid of being robbed;
the dubious characters fall behind me.
the scrawny and mangy dogs don’t bark;
they look a little like yellowish wolves.
and those keepers of keys, the night watchmen,
scan with their lanterns each entryway;
above them loose women, in scanty robes,
smoke and cough at the balcony windows.

human pain, like a baleful sea,

Ave Marias
In our streets, at twilight,
There's such sullenness, such melancholy,
That the shadows, the bustle, the river, the briny
Awaken in me an absurd desire to suffer.
The sky seems low and fog-laden,
The gas that leaks sickens me, disturbs;
And the buildings, with the chimneys, and the crowd
Turn a monotonous and London-like hue.
Trams chime, in the distance,
Carrying off the happy ones to the railway.
Countries and exhibitions flash before my eyes:
Madrid, Paris, Berlin, St. Petersburg, the world!
The buildings resemble cages with aviaries,
As bats, upon the chiming of the bells,
They leap from beam to beam the master carpenters.
The shipbuilders return in droves,
With oilskins over their shoulders, grimy, dry;
I wander through alleyways and narrow streets,
Or stray along docksides where boats are moored.
And I recall naval chronicles:
Moors, caravels, heroes, all resurrected!
Camões fights in the south, saving a book by swimming!
Grand ships sail by that I shall never see!
And twilight inspires me; and it pains!
From an English battleship boats are rowing out;
And onshore, in a clinking of plates and cutlery,
Some fashionable hotels blaze.
Two dentists argue in a hansom cab;
A lopsided clown struggles with his hoops;
The cherubs of the home float on the balconies;
At the doors, disheveled, shopkeepers are bored!
Factories and arsenals are emptied;
The river gleams viscous, the workers hurry;
And in a school of black, robust, playful,
They rush with firmness, the varinas appear.
They shake their plump hips!
Their sturdy trunks remind me of pillars;
And some, on their heads, rock their babies in baskets
Who will later drown in the storms.
Unshod! In the coal unloading,
From morning to night, aboard the ships;
And they crowd in a neighborhood where cats meow,
And rotten fish breed the foci of infection!
II
Closed Night
They call at the grilles, in the prisons. Sound
That mortifies and leaves gentle insanities!
The prison where today there are old women and children,
Rarely confines a woman of ""distinction""!
And I even suspect an aneurysm
So morbid I feel, at the lighting of the lamps;
At the sight of prisons, the old cathedral, the crosses,
My heart cries out, that swells and that sinks.
At intervals, the floors are illuminated,
And the taverns, cafes, shops, tobacconists
Spread their white reflections;
And the moon reminds me of the circus and the jugglers.
Two churches in a nostalgic square,
Cast a black stain and funereal of the clergy:
In them I dissipate an austere inquisitor,
As soon as I venture through history and expand.
In the part that collapsed in the earthquake,
The straight, equal, growing constructions enclose me;
In the rest, the steep ascents confront me,
And the bells of a monastic and devout ringing.
But, in a public and vulgar place,
With benches for lovers and slender pepper plants,
Bronze, monumental, of warlike proportions,
An epic hero ascends, on a pillar!
And I dream of cholera, I imagine the fever,
In this accumulation of stunted bodies;
Gloomy and spectral, the soldiers return;
A palace is set ablaze in the face of a hut.
Cavalry patrols leave the arches
Of barracks that were once monasteries;
Aged, others, in slow steps,
They spread throughout the capital, which cools.
Sad city! I fear that a dead passion
Will be revived for me in the distant lamps;
Your elegant women grieve me, white,
Curved to smile at the showcases of goldsmiths.
And more: the seamstresses, the florists
Descend from the department stores, causing me a jolt;
They struggle to raise their high necks
And many of them are chorus girls or accomplices.
And I, with a one-eyed lens,
I always find subject for revolted pictures:
I enter the brasserie; at tables of emigrants,
To laughter and harsh light, domino is played.
III
Under Gaslight
And I leave. The night weighs, crushes. On
The flagstone sidewalks, the impure drag themselves.
Oh, moles hospitals! Emerging from the entrances
A breath that chills the shoulders almost naked.
The shops surround me, warm. I think
I see side candles, see rows of chapels,
With saints and faithful, litters, branches, candles,
In a cathedral of immense length.
The little bourgeois of Catholicism
Slide on the floor mined by pipes;
And the piano's sick moan reminds me of the nuns
Who were killed by fasting in the Middle Ages.
In a cutler, with an apron, at the lathe,
A blacksmith swings a hammer, redly;
And from a bakery, still warm, exhales,
A wholesome and honest smell of bread in the oven.
And I who meditate a book that exacerbates,
I wish that the real and the analysis would give it to me;
Confectionery and fashion stores shine brightly;
Through the showcases an undercover man looks on.
Long descents! To paint
With verses, masterful, healthy and sincere,
The diffuse scattering of your reverberators,
And your pale, romantic and lunar look!
What a great snake, the lubricious person,
Who chooses a shawl with a debuxo pattern!
His Excellency attracts, magnetic, amidst luxury,
That along the mahogany balconies gathers.
And that old woman, with tippets! Sometimes,
Her train imitates an old fan, open,
In vertical stripes, two colors. Nearby,
Her Mecklenburg escorts prance victorious.
Foreign fabrics are displayed;
Ornamental plants dry on the shelves;
Flakes of rice powder float suffocating,
And in clouds of satin the shop assistants sway.
But everything bores! Lanterns extinguish
On the fronts, like stars, little by little;
From solitude, a hoarse peddler croaks;
They become mausoleums the radiant frameworks.
""Pity of misery!... Compassion for me!...""
And in the corners, bald, eternal, without rest,
An old man asks me for alms,
My old teacher in the Latin classes!
IV
Dead Hours
The deep ceiling of oxygen, air,
Stretches along the skylight vents;
Tears of light come from the starry eyes,
I am enthralled by the azure chimera of transmigrate.
Below, what gates! What passageways!
A bolt falls on the slabs, in the dark:
Shutters are placed, locks creak,
And the eyes of a hack chaise frighten me, bloody.
And I follow, like the lines of a staff
The august double stream of the façades;
For the silence ascends, inauspicious and whining,
The pastoral notes of a distant flute.
If I did not die, never! And eternally
Sought and achieved the perfection of things!
I forget myself to envision most chaste wives,
That nest in mansions of transparent glass!
Oh! Our children! What agile dreams,
Coming to you will bring clarity to your lives!
I want your mothers and sisters moved,
In translucent and fragile dwellings.
Ah! How the red-haired race of the future,
And the fleets of our grandfathers, and the wandering beings,
We will explore all continents
And through the vast aquatic expanses follow!
But if we live, the walled ones,
Without trees, in the dark valley of the walls!...
I think I see, in the dark, the blades of knives
And the cries of help strangled hear.
And in these cloudy corridors
They nauseate me, arising, the bellies of the taverns;
On the way, with longing, and on the edges resting their knees,
They sing, arm in arm, some sad drinkers.
I do not fear, however, the thefts;
The dubious passersby move away at a distance;
And dirty, without barking, bony, feverish, wandering,
The dogs seem wolves yellowly.
And the guards, who search the staircases,
Walk with lanterns and serve as keyholders;
Above, the immoral ones, in their light robes,
Cough, smoking on the stone of the balconies.
And, enormous, in this irregular mass
Of sepulchral buildings, with dimensions of hills,
Human pain seeks the wide horizons,
And has tides, of gall, like a sinister sea!",0

That the sun is a symbol, alright...
That the moon is a symbol, alright...
That the earth is a symbol, alright...
But who notices the sun except when the rain stops
And it bursts from the clouds and points back
To the blue of the sky?
But who notices the moon except to find
The light she casts beautiful, and not her?
But who notices the earth, which is what we step on?
They call fields, trees, and mountains ""earth""
Through an instinctive diminution,
Because the sea is also earth...
Alright, let everything be symbols...
But what symbol is it, not the sun, not the moon, not the earth,
But in this early sunset barely turning blue,
The sun peeking through tattered bits of clouds,
While the moon is already seen, mystical, on the other side,
And what remains of the daylight's glow
Gilds the head of the seamstress who pauses vaguely at the corner
Where she used to linger (she lives nearby) with her boyfriend who left her?
Symbols?... I don't want symbols...
I only want – poor figure of thinness and abandonment! –
That the boyfriend would return to the seamstress.",0

Closes the eyelids at night, before sleep.

Beside you like a corpse! In vain

Of communication, the wind dedicated to lace-like patterns

Its knees as if by the office of afternoons
And the reeds that wobble a purposeless inclination
To you who arrive, to you who depart, without words,

That you scatter over the childhood of paths,
Searching the fate of stars in the heights.

"receita para fazer azul
se quiseres fazer azul,
pega num pedaço de céu e mete-o numa panela grande,
que possas levar ao lume do horizonte;
depois mexe o azul com um resto de vermelho
da madrugada, até que ele se desfaça;
despeja tudo num bacio bem limpo,
para que nada reste das impurezas da tarde.
por fim, peneira um resto de ouro da areia
do meio-dia, até que a cor pegue ao fundo de metal.
se quiseres, para que as cores se não desprendam
com o tempo, deita no líquido um caroço de pêssego queimado.
vê-lo-ás desfazer-se, sem deixar sinais de que alguma vez
ali o puseste; e nem o negro da cinza deixará um resto de ocre
na superfície dourada. podes, então, levantar a cor
até à altura dos olhos, e compará-la com o azul autêntico.
ambas as cores te parecerão semelhantes, sem que
possas distinguir entre uma e outra.
assim o fiz – eu, abraão ben judá ibn haim,
iluminador de loulé – e deixei a receita a quem quiser,
algum dia, imitar o céu.","recipe for making the colour blue
if you wish to make the colour blue
take a piece of sky and put it in a pot
large enough to place on the flame of the horizon.
stir into the blue a pinch of early morning red
until it dissolves. pour everything
into a brass bowl that has been well washed
to eliminate all of the afternoon’s impurities.
finally, sift in a few smidgens of gold from the sand
of midday until the colour adheres to the bottom of the bowl.
to prevent the colours from separating with time,
drop a charred peach pit into the liquid.
it will disintegrate, leaving no telltale
sign, not even – from the black ash – an ochre trace
on the golden surface. you may then raise the colour
to eye level and compare it with genuine blue.
the two colours will look so alike
that you cannot distinguish one from the other.
this was how i did it – i, abraham ben judah ibn haim,
illuminator from the town of loulé. and i left the recipe
for whoever, one day, would imitate the sky.",pt_XX,en_XX,"recipe for making blue

so that nothing remains of the impurities of the evening.
finally, sieve a remnant of gold from the sand
of midday, until the color sets on the metal base.
if you wish, so that the colors do not fade
over time, add to the liquid a burned peach pit.
you will see it dissolve, leaving no signs that it was ever
there; and not even the black of the ash will leave a trace of ochre

to the height of your eyes, and compare it with the authentic blue.

parada no seu círculo e a escorrer

rasa ao chão, espalhada nos terrenos.
e o tempo vai-se gastando como a água

And especially the perfect autumn, so motionless.
And the moss spore and the plum tree
Not only give you the images of the image
But cast loose petals
So that the archetype falls upon the image.
And not only from the vegetable kingdom do the figures
Visit your mirror, o ancient pond,

Pass, in the whole time you hold
The signs of the past and the present.
So much has passed without me remembering
That we pass, only this water
Stopped in its circle and to drip
Has a mobile and immobile force
That pulls me from age to age.
Continuously it gushes, and flows out by the drain
Shallow to the ground, scattered in the lands.
And time is spent like the water
That never holds within itself the same mirror
For the images that come and are lost.",0
