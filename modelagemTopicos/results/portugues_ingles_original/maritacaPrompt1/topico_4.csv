"da menina e moça
pensando-vos estou filha
vossa mãe me está lembrando
enchem-se-me os olhos d’água
nela vos estou lavando:
nascestes filha antre mágoa
para bem filha vos seja
que no vosso nascimento
vos ouve a fortuna inveja:
morto era o contentamento
nenhuma alegria ouvistes,
vossa mãe era finada,
nos outras éamos tristes:
nada em dor em dor crescida
não sei onde isto há de ir ter
vejo-vos filha fermosa
cos olhos verdes crescer:
não era esta graça vossa
para nascer em desterro
mal haja a desaventura
que pôs mais nisto que o erro:
tinha aqui sua sepultura
vossa mãe e mágoa a nós
não éreis vos filha não
para morrerem por vós:
não houve em fados razão
nem se consente rogar
de vosso pai hei mor dó
que de si s’á de queixar:
eu vos ouvi a vós só
primeiro que outrem ninguém
não fôreis vós seu não fora
não sei se fiz mal se bem:
mas não pode ser senhora
para mal nenhum nascerdes
com este riso gracioso
que tendes sobr’olhos verdes:
conforto mais duvidoso
me é este que tomo assi
deus voos dê milhor ventura
da que tevestes té ‘qui:
que a dita e a fermosura
dizem patranhas antigas
que pelejaram um dia
sendo dantes muito amigas:
muitos hão que é fantasia
eu que vi tempos e anos
nenhuma cousa duvido
como ela é caso de danos:
mas nenhum mal nom é crido
o bem só é esperado
e na crença e na esperança
em ambas há i mudança
em ambas há i cuidado","from menina e moça
i’m thinking of you, dear girl,
your mother’s memory haunts me.
my eyes fill up with tears,
they are bathing you gently.
you were born amid sorrow—
may it yet prove a blessing.
since fortune, struck with envy,
singled you out at birth.
gone forever was contentment,
you heard no joyful voices.
your mother’s life had ended,
while ours went on in sadness.
in anguish born and raised!
i don’t know where all this is going.
i’ve watched you grow, my girl,
with green eyes so lovely.
beauty like yours wasn’t meant
to be born in exile. curses on
fate! this was clearly a work
of malevolence, not a mistake.
here lies your mother,
and we languish in grief.
you did nothing, my girl,
to incur a loss so great.
the fates spurn reason,
and will admit no protest.
i pity your poor father,
for the pain he must lament.
i heard you crying, alone,
before anyone else. you’d not
be here, had i not been there.
still, i ask if i did right.
but surely it can’t be wrong
for you to have been born
with that elegant smile of yours,
those dazzling green eyes.
it’s an unlikely comfort
that i take for myself.
may god grant you the grace
that has eluded you till now.
beauty and good fortune,
or so the old story goes,
were once the best of friends,
but became bitterly opposed.
many hold that it’s fantasy,
but in my life i’ve seen
enough not to doubt it:
fate inflicts great damage.
no harm is ever believed;
we always expect the good.
in hoping and believing
lies an element of change,
an element of concern.",pt_XX,en_XX,"Of the girl and maiden
Thinking of you I am daughter
Your mother is reminding me
My eyes fill with water
In her I am washing you:
You were born daughter between sorrow
To be well daughter it may be
That at your birth
Fortune's envy heard you:
Contentment was dead
No joy you heard,
Your mother was deceased,
We others were sad:
Nothing in pain in pain grown
I don't know where this will lead
I see you daughter beautiful
With green eyes grow:
This grace was not yours
To be born in exile
May disaster be cursed
Which put more into this than error:
Here was her burial
Your mother and sorrow to us
You were not daughter not
To die for you:
There was no reason in fate
Nor is praying allowed
I have much pity for your father
Who will complain of himself:
I heard only you
First before anyone else
You weren't his, nor was anyone else
I don't know if I did wrong or right:
But it cannot be mistress
For no evil to be born
With this gracious smile
That you have over green eyes:
More dubious comfort
This is what I take thus
God give you better fortune
Than you have had until now:
That happiness and beauty
They say old tales
That fought one day
Being once very friendly:
Many believe it's fantasy
I who have seen times and years
I doubt nothing
As it is a case of harm:
But no evil is believed
Good is only expected
And in belief and hope
In both there is change
In both there is care",4

reserves a bed for me

just beneath the grass

and a band of horses
to pummel me now and then
with their gallant trotting.

where skirmishes play out,
where worthless life
assents to the sacrifice
of the living, bitter deaths
sweeping down the ravine,
to the crack of gunshot
and the clang of swords…

the mean, grubby streets
where the frightful throng
erupts in a tumult…
loudly jostling
in savage conflict,
feral gleams in their eyes,
leaping and shouting!
thievery and murder!

in scrappy fistfights…

laughing so hard
because it doesn’t hurt.",pt_XX,en_XX,"Because the best, at last,

do not harm me...
uninvolved in vain labors,
the seasons of the year.
pass the summer, autumn,
the pruning, the plowing, and the sowing,
and I sleeping a sleep
beneath a stone.
better still if by chance
my bed is reserved
on the extensive and flat plain
only under the grass
that April copious soaks...
and, slender, at intervals
be struck by the gallop
of bands of horses.
or in the mountainous forest,
to strife so propitious,
where the ungrateful life
disposes to sacrifice
of lives, hard deaths
roll through the ravines,
with clashes of armor
and clinks of swords...
or beneath the floor, even,
infamous and vile of the street,
where the turbulent rabble
breaks out, stirs,
writhes, screams,
wild in the conflicts,
with impulses of a savage beast
in eyes, leaps, shouts...
robberies, murders!
hours never tranquil,
in brutal fistfights
the jawbones are broken...
and I under the firm earth,
compact, pressed down,
very quietly. laughing
at nothing hurting me.",4
"pulmões
[sobre a fotografia de uma criança encontrada morta numa praia da turquia]
o meu pai chamou-me e pediu-me que escolhesse
um brinquedo – só um – de que gostasse muito; e
que separasse outro brinquedo para o aylan, que
ainda não sabia escolher, mas só um, e tinha de
ser pequeno. o meu pai explicou-me que nessa
noite ia fazer de tudo quase nada numa trouxa
leve; porque assim, quando o aylan e eu caíssemos
de sono, ele e a minha mãe poderiam levar-nos ao
colo sem ficarem para trás. havia lágrimas nos olhos
do meu pai quando contou que, na manhã seguinte,
teríamos de deixar a nossa terra; mas logo se
recompôs, dizendo que kobanî também já não era
bem a nossa terra, que a nossa casa era a ruína da
nossa casa, que toda a síria não passava de um tímpano
exausto de tanto estrondo e dois olhos cansados,
mas tão cansados, de chamas e de sangue. o meu pai
achava que o aylan era demasiado pequeno para
compreender e, por isso, dissera-lhe apenas que
iríamos dar um passeio de barco, que passaríamos
o dia numa praia e que, enquanto eu e a minha mãe
nadássemos no mar até ficarmos sem fôlego, ele
podia simplesmente deitar-se de bruços na areia,
como tanto gostava. o meu pai nunca nos mentiu.","lungs
[on a photograph of a child found dead on a beach in turkey]
my father called me over and told me to pick out
a toy – just one – that i liked the most; and
to pick out another toy for aylan, who
was still too young to choose, but just one, and
it had to be small. my father told me that
tonight he’d wrap up our things in a light
bundle; this way, once aylan and i fell
asleep, he and my mother could carry us
without staying behind. there were tears in my father’s
eyes when he said that, tomorrow morning,
we’d have to leave our land; but he quickly
pulled it together, saying kobanî wasn’t really
our land anymore, that our home was the ruins
of our home, that all of syria was nothing but an eardrum
exhausted from all the noise and two eyes, tired,
so tired, of seeing flames and blood. my father
thought aylan was too little to
understand, so he just told him that
we were going on a boat ride, that we’d spend
the day on a beach and that, while my mother and i
swam in the sea until we were breathless, he
could simply lie face down in the sand,
as he loved to do so much. my father never lied to us.",pt_XX,en_XX,"lungs

"tempo e memória
em qualquer momento, no começo e no fim,
na medida de toda a vida, prostrados de toda a pena,
permanecemos sem amanhã nem princípio,
esbatidos na idade e na distância, saqueados na mentira,
apenas juntando a areia ao fundo de um recreio,
riscando a areia escorada do nosso entendimento,
a simular um amuleto contra o regresso impossível.
não temos trégua, não podemos voltar, e sem
ruído afastamo-nos para onde de longe chamamos
no ar rarefeito, entre os ramos, dos plátanos de ontem,
figuras resumidas a uma branca poeira informe,
em quantas inumeráveis semelhanças com a morte.

senão para entender a justa aceitação da nossa vida.","time and memory
in any given moment, in the beginning and in the end,
in the measure of a life time, downcast by full sorrow,

only able to gather sand in some recreation ground,
drawing lines through the dust that bears our understanding,
pretending there’s some lucky charm against the impossible return.
there’s no truce, we can’t go back, and soundless
we shift away towards there where we call from afar
through the rarefied air, amongst the branches, the plane trees of yesterday,
figures compressed into shapeless white dirt,
in so many countless death similes.
sensing decay, this intimate decline of all there is,
fully aware of incertitude as the exhibited sign of memory
which exposes each breath of time as its own hoax
and denies us the slightest parting from forsakenness

if not only to admit that which we believe didn’t happen
except to understand the fair acceptance of our living.",pt_XX,en_XX,"time and memory

e escarros escuros

bem remanesce no contorno puído de cidades

viemos de longe, de patíbulos que ninguém contará,
evocando pontos brumosos e vagas escolhas,
a custo apartados da dor de uma época a outra sobrepondo-se,

Evoking foggy points and vague choices,
Struggling separated from pain as one era overlaps another,
To finally see elusive the attics from which we left

And realize that the path is made by seizing
What continuously slips from it, inaudible – fading.

Immersed in the background noise of a staircase,

Is the root of what we did in our favor,
The joy that emanates after captivity.",4

“que só nos convirá em sorte acenar, acenar sempre, e sem remorso,
pois que é no que perdido foi que fomos deixando que se viva.”

valerá o esforço em simular, a nossos pobres seguidores,

a linha que da vida fomos consentindo que se faça.

regressa e entrar humildemente por engano pela morte dentro

happy the man who manages sadness wisely
and learns to divide it among the days
though months and years pass it will never leave him

while weaving in our hands a belated heart

the blue equilibrium of summer’s sheer mornings
by the ocean that overflows with us
in the long farewell of our condition
it is sad to see in the garden the sun’s solitude
reaching from the city’s houses and din
to a distant hint of river
and the meager life meted out to us
it is sadder to have to be born and to die
and to have trees at the end of the street

returning and to enter humbly into death by mistake

was the only season
