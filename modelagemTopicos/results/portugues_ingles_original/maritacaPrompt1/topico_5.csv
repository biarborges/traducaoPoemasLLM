"carta ao pai
agora que o senhor
mais assemelha pedaço
de carne com dois olhos
dirigidos ao teto escuro
no leito em que provável
só não há-de morrer só
porque nem a própria
saliva poderá engolir
por si na companhia
somente desta sonda
que o alimenta
me pergunto se ainda
em validade a proibição
da mãe em confessar
ao senhor os hábitos
amorosos das mucosas
que são minhas
e se deveras me amaria
tanto menos soubesse
quanta fricção já tiveram
que não lhes cabia
biológica ou religiosa
-mente e se também
pediria para sua filhoa
a morte que desejou
a tantos de minha laia
quando surgiam na tela
da glboo da record
da manchete do sbt
que sempre constituíram
seu cordão umbilical
com a tradição
e se deveras faria
sobrevir a eles
grande destruição
pela violência
com que urrava
seus xingamentos
típicos de macho
nascido no interior
desse pais de machos
interiores e quebrados
em seus orgulhos falhos
de crer que o pai
é o que abarrota
geladeiras e não deixa
que falte à mesa
o alimento que nutre
as mesmas mucosas
em que corre
o seu sangre
mas não seu deus
e ora neste leito partido
o cérebro em veias
como riachos insistentes
em correr
fora das margens
se o senhor
soubesse o dolo
com que manchei
a mesa
de todos os patriarcas
ainda pergunto-me
se me receberia
com a mansidão
que aceita na testa
o beijo desta sua filhoa
que nada mais é
que a sua imagem
e semelhança invertidas
tal espelho
que refletisse opostos
de gênero e religião
ou o desenho
animado na infância
de uma sala de justiça
onde numa tela
podia-se observar
um mundo ao avesso
e se o pai e o pai
odeiam deveras
o gerado nas normas
da biologia e religião
mais tarde porém geridos
na transgressão das leis
que o pai e o pai
impõem-nos na ciência
de sermos todos falhos
nessa terra onde procriar
é tão frequente
que gere prazer
nenhum e olho
o senhor
com essas pupilas
que talvez jamais
reflitam o pai
mas ora veem o pai
eu
mesmo pedaço
de carne
com dois olhos
peço perdão
em silêncio
pois sequer posso
dizer que não
mais há tempo
e mesmo assim
e porém
e no entanto
e contudo
pelo medo adversativo
de talvez abalar

de alicerces

now that my lord
more closely resembles a hunk
of meat with two eyes

from the gurney where likely
you will not die alone
only because not even able
to swallow your saliva
yourself in the company
of this tube alone
that feeds you
i ask myself
if mother's ban
against confessing
to my lord the amorous habits
of my mucous membranes
is still in place
and if indeed you would love me
the less you knew about
how much rubbing they'd already had
that did not befit them
biological or religious
-ly and also if
you would want for your boyess
the death you wished
on so many of my kind
when they appeared on screen
on globo record
manchete or sbt
which always constituted
your umbilical connection
to tradition
and if indeed you would
make come upon them
great destruction
by the violence
of your raging slurs
typical of a macho man
born in a remote town
in this country of machos
remote and broken
in their false pride
believing that a father
is he who crams
refrigerators full and does
not let the table want for
food to nourish
the same mucous membranes
in which your blood
but not your god
runs thick
and now in this broken gurney
your brain all veins
like rivulets bent on
running
outside the lines
if my lord
knew how
i'd stained the patriarchs'
table with deceit
i still ask myself
if you would welcome
me as meekly
as you accept a kiss
on the forehead from
your boyess
who is nothing more
than your own image
and likeness inverted
a mirror such
as reflects opposites
of gender and religion
or the cartoon
from my childhood
of a hall of justice
where on a screen
you could watch a world gone wrong
and if the father and father
indeed scorn
one created by the norms
of biology and religion
yet later corrected
after flaunting the laws
the father and the father
impose on us in the science
of being all of us flawed
on this earth where procreating
is so common
it brings pleasure
not at all and i look at
my lord
with these pupils
that maybe never
reflect the father
but now see the father
i
also a hunk
of meat
with two eyes
ask forgiveness
in silence
for at least i can
say there is no more time
and nevertheless
and even still
and although
and yet
for conflicted fear
of possibly shaking
a rudimentary system
of foundation
holding up this house
holding up this room
holding up this borrowed

silence",pt_XX,en_XX,"Letter to Father
Now that you are
More akin to a piece
Of meat with two eyes
Directed at the dark ceiling
In the bed where it's likely
You won't die alone
Because not even your own
Saliva you can swallow
In the company solely
Of this tube
That feeds you
I wonder if the prohibition
Of mother in confessing
To you the amorous habits
Of the mucous membranes
That are mine
And whether you would love me
Even less knowing
How much friction they've had
Which isn't biologically or religiously
-ly and if she too
Would ask for your death
Which you wished for so many of my kind
When they appeared on the screen
Of glboo's highlight reel
Of the sbt's headline
Which always constituted
Your umbilical cord
With tradition
And whether indeed
You would bring upon them
Great destruction
Through the violence
With which you roared
Your typical male insults
Born in the interior
Of this country of broken
Inwardly proud men
Who believe that a father
Is one who stocks
Refrigerators and doesn't let
The table lack the food
That nourishes
The same mucous membranes
In which runs
Your blood
But not your god
And now in this broken bed
The brain in veins
Like streams insistently
Running
Outside the banks
If you
Knew the deceit
With which I've stained
The table
Of all patriarchs
I still wonder
If you would receive me
With the meekness
That accepts on the forehead
The kiss of this your daughter
Who is nothing more
Than your image
And likeness reversed
Like a mirror
That reflects opposites
Of gender and religion
Or the animated series
Of childhood
From a courtroom
Where on a screen
One could observe
A world turned upside down
And if the father and the father
Really hate the one generated
Under the laws of biology and religion
But later governed
By the transgression of the laws
That father and father
Impose upon us in the knowledge
That we are all flawed
In this land where procreation
Is so frequent
That it brings no pleasure
And I look at you
With these pupils
That perhaps will never
Reflect the father
But now see the father
I myself
Piece of meat
With two eyes
Ask for forgiveness
In silence
For I can barely
Say that I don't
There is still time
And even so
And yet
And however
And despite
Because of the adversative fear
Of perhaps shaking
A rudimentary system
Of foundations
Below the house
Below the room
Below this borrowed
Hospital bed

Silence once again",5
"morticínio ancestral
quando minha avó torcia o pescoço
dos frangos, não raras vezes
chegando a decapitá-los,
e os lançava ao chão frio de cimento
para aquela dança assustadora,
não havia em seu rosto
paixão, prazer, ou pena.
na escuridão escondida dentro do meio-dia,
aqueles morticínios eram os atos
mais honestos na violência
daquela casa e daquela infância.
afogando na água fervente
os cadáveres sem cabeça
[que ficara de banda no quintal
interrogando seu criador],
ela passava a depená-los, ágil,
qual fosse ela um gavião-pedrês.
como o cafuné do crânio da onça
no crânio da capivara,
ou o abraço anelar das garras do carcará
ao redor do corpo todo-torso da cobra,
nada naquela velha
era cogitado
para além da missão simples:
alimentar a prole.
como todo animal que não questiona
a cadeia alimentar diante da fome,
minha avó foi o bicho mais inocente
da minha casa e da minha selva.
mais do que os gatos e pombos,
mais do que os jabutis e coelhos,
com certeza
era mais inocente minha avó
do que as cachorras da casa,
aquelas cachorras grandes e gordas
com os dentes afiados — mas inúteis,
esperando também daquela mamífera-anciã
que manchasse ela as mãos de sangue.","ancestral slaughter
when my grandmother used to wring
the necks of chickens, not infrequently
to the point of decapitation,
and dropped them to the cold cement floor
and that shocking dance,
on her face there was no trace
of passion, pleasure, or pity.
in the darkness hidden within the noonday,
those killings were the most honest acts
in the violence of that house,
that childhood.
after plunging into boiling water
those headless corpses
[who’d stood in brood in the yard
questioning their creator],
she began to pluck them, with all
the agility of a gray-lined hawk.
like the caress of the jaguar’s skull
on the capybara’s, or the annulate
embrace of the caracara’s claws
on a snake’s all-torso body,
nothing in that old woman
was cognized
beyond a simple mission:
to feed her offspring.
as any animal does not question
the food chain in the face of hunger,
my grandmother was of all animals
the most innocent in my house
and in my forest.
more than cats and pigeons,
more than tortoises and rabbits,
this is far more certain:
my grandmother was more innocent
even than our household dogs,
our big, fat dogs
with sharp — but useless — teeth,
also waiting for that age-old mammal
to drench her hands in blood.",pt_XX,en_XX,"ancestral slaughter

quem quer que lhe tivesse concebido os ossos, era então visível o objectivo de os fazer florir. deles brotaria a pele, o céu, a encenação da glória. tudo isso mais não eram, entretanto, do que imagens em apuros, imagens atacadas por memórias em conflito com o presente, ou mesmo com o passado onde pareciam radicar, e que, esbeiçando-se nos bordos, davam lugar a que o esquecimento sobre elas actuasse como uma espécie de ácido sulfúrico.
de cada vez que o invadia, a enxurrada da memória ascendia-lhe assim a um tal nível da consciência que os seus próprios ossos, deixando de ser pontos fixos e estáveis aos quais ele se pudesse segurar, vinham, desmantelados, boiar à superfície das águas borrascosas, de mistura
com entranhas donde só a alma parecia não se ter desalojado ainda, como que as inflando e

The self had shattered so violently that his very name was a wound, through which flesh oozed. From the lost mornings of his childhood, sunlit and now reduced to scant rags clinging to the roots, there would sometimes escape a flash, a desperate call towards reality, rending him from eyes to ears.
It was visible then, whoever had conceived his bones, the goal of making them bloom. From them would emerge the skin, the sky, the staging of glory. Yet all this was no more than images in distress, images assaulted by memories in conflict with the present, or even with the past where they seemed to originate, and that, fraying at the edges, gave way to forgetfulness acting upon them like a sort of sulfuric acid.
Each time the torrent of memory overwhelmed him, it rose to such a level of consciousness that his own bones, no longer fixed and stable points to which he could cling, came, dislodged, to float on the surface of the stormy waters, mingling
with intestines from which the soul seemed not yet to have been dislodged, inflating and preserving it afloat among the fatness and turmoil of memories.",5

"sete anos de pastor jacob servia
labão, pai de raquel, serrana bela;
mas não servia ao pai, servia a ela,
e a ela só por prémio pretendia.
os dias, na esperança de um só dia,
passava, contentando-se com vê-la;
porém o pai, usando de cautela
em lugar de raquel lhe dava lia.
vendo o triste pastor que com enganos
lhe fora assi negada a sua pastora,
como se a não tivera merecida;
começa de servir outros sete anos,
dizendo: — mais servira, se não fora
para tão longo amor tão curta a vida.","jacob
for seven years, the shepherd jacob slaved
for the father of beautiful rachel, working not for the man,
but only for her, knowing ever since he began
that she alone was the only reward he craved.
his days, dreaming of the wedding that lay ahead,
passed by, content to see her from time to time,
until her father plotted his duplicitous crime,
by placing leah in jacob’s marriage bed.
learning the cruel deception, jacob, in tears,
had lost the one he loved, as if, somehow,
he hadn’t truly earned the proper wife.
but he starts all over again, for seven more years,
saying, “if life wasn’t so short, beginning right now,
i\'d serve even longer for rachel, the love of my life.”",pt_XX,en_XX,"seven years as a shepherd Jacob served
Laban, father of Rachel, she who is fair;
but not to the father he served, but to her,
and for her alone he sought the prize.
The days he spent, hoping for just one day,
content to merely see her;
but the father, using caution,
in Rachel's place gave him Leah.
Seeing the shepherd's sorrow, tricked by deceit,
he realized the beloved one was denied him,
as if he had not deserved her;
he then began to serve another seven years,
saying: — I would have served longer, if not
for the shortness of life in such a long love.",5
"abdicação
toma-me, ó noite eterna, nos teus braços
e chama-me teu filho. eu sou um rei
que voluntariamente abandonei
o meu trono de sonhos e cansaços.
minha espada, pesada a braços lassos,
em mãos viris e calmas entreguei,
e meu ceptro e coroa — eu os deixei
na antecâmara, feitos em pedaços.
minha cota de malha, tão inútil,
minhas esporas, de um tinir tão fútil,
deixei-as pela fria escadaria.
despi a realeza, corpo e alma,
e regressei à noite antiga e calma
como a paisagem ao morrer do dia.","abdication

and take me into your arms. i’m a king
who relinquished, willingly,
my throne of dreams and tedium.
my sword, which dragged my weak arms down,
i surrendered to strong and steady hands,
and in the anteroom i abandoned
my shattered scepter and crown.
my spurs that jingled to no avail
and my useless coat of mail
i left on the cold stone steps.
i took off royalty, body and soul,
and returned to the night so calm, so old,
like the landscape when the sun sets.",pt_XX,en_XX,"Renunciation
Take me, oh eternal night, in your arms
And call me your child. I am a king
Who has voluntarily relinquished
My throne of dreams and weariness.
My sword, heavy in weary hands,
I gave to strong and calm ones,
And my scepter and crown — I left them
In the antechamber, shattered.
My armor, so useless,
My spurs, with their trivial jingle,
I left them on the cold staircase.
I stripped off royalty, body and soul,
And returned to the ancient, calm night
Like the landscape at dusk.",5
"retrato de uma princesa desconhecida
para que ela tivesse um pescoço tão fino
para que os seus pulsos tivessem um quebrar de caule
para que os seus olhos fossem tão frontais e limpos
para que a sua espinha fosse tão direita
e ela usasse a cabeça tão erguida
com uma tão simples claridade sobre a testa
foram necessárias sucessivas gerações de escravos
de corpo dobrado e grossas mãos pacientes
servindo sucessivas gerações de príncipes

para que ela fosse aquela perfeição

with such a natural glow on her forehead

with stooping bodies and patient rough hands
serving successive generations of princes

that lonely exiled aimless perfection",pt_XX,en_XX,"portrait of an unknown princess
