"nada existe que não tivesse começado.
mesmo na lonjura, decisiva porção iluminada,
em territórios despojados de todo o fim, em
areais de mares a desaguar desconhecidamente,
mais não olhamos senão a extensão do que vimos.
se campos da livónia vão dar a campos da mazúria,
se mosaicos amaciam na água de banhos mornos,
e além houver só cemitérios seguindo cemitérios, e
a meio deles, parado sem vento, o bosque de bétulas,
se o sol é o lume do azeite a esmiolar o pão
ou o clarão lascado nas muralhas de helsingør,
se o enredo da morte é igual em toda a parte,
seja na flauta de santa maria ou no gaiteiro de tallinn,
é porque modulamos num lugar o que lastrou de outro.
mesmo sem querer, ou sejam sombras afastando-se,
mais não tecemos que a linha de acasos e acertos
que uma corrente conduz, a cada um, em separado,
à passagem mais sensível do acabamento.
mesmo isolando os lugares numa função laboriosa,
detalhando as suas divergências, e as pontas extremas
— a parecença entre o que são e o que pensámos serem,
mesmo nas regiões cruzadas por comboios extensos,
onde a noite cairá em escamas de lavanda,
seguiremos a mesma história — afundamos os pés no mesmo solo.
naquilo por que vamos repetidamente levados,
ansiando o que se manifeste acolá na próxima enseada,
alisando com a mão os castanheiros onde inscrevemos, depois
de outros, nossos sinuosos nomes, nossos amores,
sempre tornamos ao ponto em que tudo se repete e inicia,
de que atingimos apenas um minuto só — um instante,
a lâmina que medeia o ano que passa e o ano que vem.","nothing exists that hasn’t had a beginning.
nothing exists that hasn’t had a beginning.
even in the distance, a clear lit speck,
in territories stripped from all limits, on
sands that flow from unknown seas,
we only contemplate the extent of what we perceived.
if fields in livonia lead to fields in masuria,
if tiles are smoothed in tepid bath waters,
and further on graveyard follows graveyard, and
in their midst, inert in the lack of wind, the birch wood stands,
if the sun is the flame of the olive oil crumbling the bread
or the chipped lightening on the walls of helsingør,
if the death plot is everywhere the same,
be it in the santa maria flute or in the tallinn concertina
it is because we modulate in one place what has seeped from another.
even unwillingly, or perhaps it’s the shadows on the move,
we weave no more than a row of chances and discretions
along a current which takes each one of us, separately,
to the most sensitive final passage.
even if laboriously we detach the places,
detailing their diversions and extremes
— the similarity between what they are and what we thought they were,
even throughout regions intersected by extensive trains,
where night will fall in scales of lavender,
we’ll follow the same story — we sink our feet in the same mud.
in that which repeatedly sucks us in,
as we yearn for whatever comes to pass further in the next cove
smoothing with our hands the oak trees on whose bark we inscribe,
like others before us, our sinuous names, our loves,

of which we grasp a mere minute — an instant,
the blade mediating between this year and the next.",pt_XX,en_XX,"nothing exists that did not have a beginning.

na sombra das folhas de nossos passos
sob um manto de nuvens o dia escureceu; o outono
gerou e apagou novas e efémeras
constelações, e à janela, olhando os cumes nevados ao
longe envoltos no orvalho de um doce sofrimento,
nossos olhos envelheceram; as nossas lembranças e aqueles
que amámos teceram palavras esquecidas; e a vida,
seguindo e caindo sem fim, pareceu apagar-se
como espuma numa recordação fugaz, um bloco de gelo,
transparente, esculpindo e transformando os aspectos do tempo ou
que os gansos agarravam com as asas as frágeis
penas do seu ser, as faziam estilhaçar.
mas era justamente por os anos passados pesarem
sobre nós, voltarem, ou desaparerem, que as terras e os
vales se sentia que suspiravam, que marcavam grãos de areia
no rosto, como outrora em connemara; que se sentia que a natureza
estava prestes a transformar-se, que a nossa sombra estava
prestes a desaparecer; que a neve caía, ia caindo, a neve dos teixos
deixando passar a neve; e que o inverno chegava com
as suas raízes escoradas pela água, e que a ronda do ano
dava outra volta fortuita na charneca, outra volta
na primavera e no verão; outro sopro do seu espírito, como um
gerânio que as pétalas desenham num curso incessante, invisível, e caíssem
na cratera da inocência, dos que vivem, dos que morrem.","circular time

about to disappear; the snow was falling, kept falling, the yew snow

its roots dipped in water, and the turn of the year

na hora em que eu mais ruía
o sol aplainava o relvado, palmeiras
ondulavam num lago turvo
longe o escaravelho porvindoiro
que as reduziu a um coto
assemelhando-as a um ananás que degrada hoje
pelos jardins
o repuxo animava sem triunfo o pântano
da juventude
as varandas em fogo
o verão começando pelo fim
horas extraordinárias aquelas
em que as aves adiavam o repouso por causa
dos insectos do turno sequente
ourados absortos estrepitantes
a hora em que mais ninguém deitava como eu
a bicicleta sobre a falta
e se sentava na relva prendendo as lágrimas
as mãos tapando o rosto o rosto entre os geolhos e uma
roda atrás a girar
não havia o ecrã de bolso oportuno
era inevitável encarar o que não tem conserto
nem nunca terá
era do dia o instante altíloquo
uma harmónica crepitava nos auscultadores
feria de morte o touro da tarde
esse búfalo ermo que se aparta da manada
para ficar-se
os subidos candeeiros acendiam
havia um muro recém pintado
sujo já por um grafito de província
um cão passava ao largo levantava o focinho ao
perfume dos jantares
que chegava de onde
se entrevia o espalha-cor dos televisores
havia o farrapo de lua
como flanela posta sobre a ganga das alturas
agraudava os dós arrumados
na caixa do futuro
a hédera das extensões percorria aquela hora
uma ideia sulcava a charneca celeste
o coração alpinista no avesso dos volumes
rarefeito
o mundo era já uma seara de nojo
e fartura – belo desastroso feroz – lugar de forças
e destruições
eu tacteava de olhos fechados
puro intrínseco
procurava um celeiro urbano onde guardar
o ouro-sémen pronto a detonar
a libélula extrema o grilo inicial
a andorinha cujo ninho resulta de um cúmulo
de lama e ervas secas e rasoira

nas minhas costas o exíguo refrigério
da biblioteca pública

repousando da luta de guerrilha
hasta la derrota, siempre!

billowed above the turbid lake
faraway the promised beetle
reduced those palms to a stump
until they seemed like a pineapple which these days
rots in the gardens

scent of dinners

the televisions’ color-blend rose in the air

like flannel sewn onto the denim of the heights

of mud and dried weeds who smooths
the surfaces feeding itself in the air

of the public library

resting from their war of resistance

but reluctant enemy

fiapos de carne seca
tragos de café fumegante

i’m watching her:
sweet the alp in the angle of her jaw
when she wakes
the canvas soaked at dawn
the grass outside darkens just as the sun rising
dilutes sleep
the mules feed off the fleeting
boreal pastures
before us a way opens up
luminously
glued to keeping quiet
to moving
but a breeze already inflames
making us want for a lake, placing
a range on the horizon
a less uncrossable elevation
than the lowlands of lived life
we say goodbye to the humid moss
fingered between thighs
stir the last pleasure out of the little
campfire that crackled
at the shelter’s opening through the long cold hours
we stuff rucksacks
leather and straps tested
we fixed our hair
munch a bit of flour
shredded bits of jerky
swigs of steaming coffee
we, the soldiers of alexander
whom nights of whiskey never fell
whose boots don’t weigh a thing
nor shame the fevers
the rectangle left by the tent
will remain for a while marking the plot of grass
stones ringing what had been
a scintillating flame later gone dark
now pasture to the scent of the timid
animals that will wander in
sounding out this sullied bit of the scene
at this very moment our scent
sails through narrow ravines
mixed with the dust and the clamor of hoofs that brings us
straying close on the edge of precipices
our own echoing
will embarrass us
but within – more silence even than the gorse
on the cliff sides –
and hardened, soaked with mist, atypical
arching over our maps
opening compasses
jotting quick notes about the way

I look at her:
sweet the vertex in the angle of the jaw
when she wakes
the canvas soaked in the dawn
outside the grass dyes as much as the star under it
dilutes sleep
the mules feed on the fatuous
boreal pastures
in front of us a path articulates
illuminating
glued to silence
to movement
but already a breath ignites
returns to us the desire for a lake, places
on the horizon the mountain range
a less insurmountable elevation
than the plain of the lived
we say goodbye to the wet moss
fingerprinted between thighs
we shake off what is left of the pleasure
the small light that crackled at the mouth of the shelter
long cold hours

tested leather and bandages
straightened our hair
we put a little flour in our teeth
threads of dried meat
sips of coffee smoking

the sparkling flame that later turned black
and is fodder for the scent of the fearful
fauna that will come
to probe this dirty part of the place

will soar through ravines and gorges
mixed with the dust and the clatter of the hooves with which
we wandered on the edge of the abysses

will be ashamed

adentrada na noite que divide e reparte irmãmente os dois
pedaços da mesma ideia:
redonda achatada nos polos insegura no seu tombo
escuridão afora
a cabeça pendular metida entre ombros
sombras
na órbita do absurdo a cumprir a curvatura que lhe cabe
errando distorcendo a silenciosa
nitidez dos hemisférios

de visíveis

onde uma língua lambe partículas, intenta locuções
ou a mudez dos vaga-lumes

pelo buraco de uma agulha o camelo
do raciocínio

round flattened at the poles insecure in its fall
out of darkness
the pendular head sunk between shoulders
shadows
the orbit of the absurd fulfilling its incumbent curvature
wandering distorting the silent
clarity of hemispheres
festooned in eyes of beryl, orifices, surrounded
by visibilities
panoramas breaking off that linger
long afterwards, coiling
a game of veiling and unveiling on the rooftop terrace
of events
where a tongue licks particles, proffers phrases
or the muteness of fireflies
but everything scatters from everything else
even though we thrust an arm into the void
out from the center, it’s thwarted
and everything crashes, velocious
mobile rewinding, an utter retroversion, and we can see
the camel of reason
pass through the eye of a needle
and it snows in this geometry
such
resplendence really as though a flame were handed to us
to fill the darkness

burning the weeds
burying the signs
tipping the sphere of thinking into the water

ever dimmer
inundated, sleep is submerged under nocturnal weight
the body shudders with anonymity
it’s in the calm of a room humming with death
that our sphere falls into its crowd of ghosts

on a different, a singular clarity
and in this emptiness, this opening, in this
high burgeoning snowflake a magnolia blooms and blooms
the immense sequoia of the world retires
to its dominion
while dimensions of fear and crap cool in their own venue

if you wish to make the colour blue

stir into the blue a pinch of early morning red
until it dissolves. pour everything
into a brass bowl that has been well washed

to prevent the colours from separating with time,
drop a charred peach pit into the liquid.
it will disintegrate, leaving no telltale
sign, not even – from the black ash – an ochre trace
on the golden surface. you may then raise the colour
to eye level and compare it with genuine blue.
the two colours will look so alike
that you cannot distinguish one from the other.

madrugada. passos soltos de gente que saiu
com destino certo e sem destino aos tombos
no meu quarto cai o som depois
a luz. ninguém sabe o que vai
por esse mundo. que dia é hoje?
soa o sino sólido as horas. os pombos
alisam as penas. no meu quarto cai o pó.
um cano rebentou junto ao passeio.
um pombo morto foi na enxurrada
junto com as folhas dum jornal já lido.
impera o declive
um carro foi-se abaixo
portas duplas fecham
no ovo do sono a nossa gema.
sirenes e buzinas. ainda ninguém via satélite
sabe ao certo o que aconteceu. estragou-se o alarme
da joalharia. os lençóis na corda
abanam os prédios. pombos debicam
o azul dos azulejos. assoma à janela
quem acordou. o alarme não pára o sangue
desavém-se. não veio via satélite a querida imagem o vídeo
não gravou
e duma varanda um pingo cai
de um vaso salpicando o fato do bancário","waking up on the street of the world
early morning. footsteps of people going out
with a definite destination or indefinitely stumbling
the sound falling in my room and then
the light. no one knows what goes on
in this world. what day is today?
the bell solidly tolls the hour. the pigeons
smooth their feathers. the dust falls in my room.
a pipe burst open next to the sidewalk
a dead pigeon was swept away in the torrent
along with the pages of an old newspaper.
the slope rules
a car went under
double doors close
our yolk in the egg of sleep.
horns and sirens. it’s still not clear
via satellite just what happened. the alarm
of the jewelry shop went haywire. hanging sheets
fan the buildings. pigeons peck
the glaze on the tiles. those who woke up have come
to the window. the alarm won’t quit. the blood
seethes. the precious image via satellite didn’t arrive the vcr
recorded nothing
and from a flower-pot on a balcony a drop of water
falls and lands on the bank teller’s suit",pt_XX,en_XX,"waking up on the street of the world

"das coisas
nem todas as coisas marcam para nós
o tempo com tenacidade, nos seus halos.
muitas ocultam ou não nos devolvem
o pensamento com que as havíamos querido.
ó coisa imaginada, reflexo na água,
ó tanque que conténs a história do tempo,
hora a hora nas quatro estações.
tens o inverno, o verão, a primavera
e sobretudo o outono perfeito, tão imóvel.
e o miósporo e a ameixoeira
não só te dão as imagens da imagem
como te lançam as pétalas soltas
para que o arquétipo tombe sobre a imagem.
e não apenas do reino vegetal as figuras
visitam o teu espelho, ó tanque antigo,
como os peixes, as aves e os insectos
passam, no inteiro tempo em que tu guardas
os sinais do passado e do presente.
tanta coisa passou sem me lembrar
que passamos, só esta água
parada no seu círculo e a escorrer
tem uma força móvel e imóvel
que me puxa de idade para idade.
continuamente jorra, e sai pela caleira
rasa ao chão, espalhada nos terrenos.
e o tempo vai-se gastando como a água
que nunca tem em si o mesmo espelho
para as imagens vindas e perdidas.","on things

in the whole time where you preserve
the signs of the past and present.

enclosed in its circle and flowing
has a mobile and immobile force
