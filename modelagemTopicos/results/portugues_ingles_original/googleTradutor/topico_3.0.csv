"a viagem de alexandre à índia
andaste de um ao outro lado da terra na vida interminável,
tiveste degredos, piedosos cíumes, a fé desvanescida,
amantes paradas na lavoura, roubando-te o rosto amado.
viste vestígios de que foste a sombra de ninguém,
olhos sem pudor, do reflexo dos ferros no tropel,
franjas do domínio pueril de alexandre, olhando gaugamela.
partiste num porto de transição para o levante,
com vazios para trás, todo o tempo a poder ver,
e ao primeiro inverno, pelos cardeais das suas cinzas,
começaste a travessia que não termina, a história que não acaba.
soubeste porque se vislumbra, em lágrimas, o pinheiro da juventude,
o nome quebrado num turvo ar medido sem corda,
e a maresia do vento de feição no segundo inverno.
em troca perseguiste o que rege o homem fortuito,
segredando em palácios de mármore que são apenas pedras,
dos fracassos a que jamais alguém ajoelhara.
ao terceiro inverno descobriste o hemisfério, e ao quarto,
sem ideia de guerra ou ordem para mudar o reino,
escolheste adornar os aquedutos sob o manto dos regatos,
sentado, na brisa no tanque, ao febril entardecer.
de quem te aproximaste, no seu trajecto interminado,
sem lugar senão o que esfria na mente recortada,
naquilo que se ramifica, tornando-se na própria teia,
contigo propagou o dever de passar em toda a parte.
e quando veio o quinto inverno, e o sexto, suturaste o sangue,
trouxeste a pele à curva dos rios, acolheste o que de resto se desmorona,
e pudeste enfim, na crença dos migradores furtivos, entender que
tudo se perde noutro lugar ainda, e após esse ainda noutro
e que ao fim de cada manhã noutra manhã
tudo é incerto, tão conforme o dente-de-leão no meio de searas,
tão emudecido como a veia exausta dos não sepultados.
na mansarda onde vagueia o dia e a noite
o vento responde, cortando o centeio e o calcário, e a vela
que brilha na luz de estrelas veladas, já desaparecidas,
pisadas, mudas, engolidas aos pés do sétimo inverno,
arpoa o coração e a ruína — os meridianos despem-se, voam
em vinte e cinco anos que há pouco se beijavam, e seja dito ou não dito
o prazer que inflige um pico de tormentos
por lábios que só as mulheres conhecem
no moinho das águas da morte em varanasi,
sacode a chama de quanto vale, dura e canta
o princípio e o fim do teu poder na terra.","alexandres`s travel to india
you wandered an interminable life across the earth,
suffered exile, piteous jealousy, futile faith,
labour-arrested lovers plundering your beloved’s face.
you saw traces of having been no one’s shadow,
impudent eyes, the reflection of iron on the rampage,
hints of alexander’s puerile dominance, contemplating gaugamela.
you set off from a transient port towards the levant,
leaving emptiness behind, seeing all of time,
and in the first winter, by the cardinals of its ashes,
you started the endless crossing, the incessant history.
you knew, because the pine tree of youth can be glimpsed through tears,
of the shattered name in a cloudy mood measured without ropes,
and of the favourable sea breeze in the second winter.
in exchange you pursued that which rules the fortuitous man,
whispering in marble palaces that are but stones,
failures to which no one had ever knelt.
by the third winter you discovered the hemisphere, and by the fourth,
non intent on war or order to change the kingdom,
you chose to adorn aqueducts with the mantle of streams,
sitting by the pool breeze, in the evening´s lingering fever.
whomever you approached, in their indefinite path,
without a place except that which fades inside a patchy mind,
in that which branches out and becomes the very web,
has spread with you the duty to pass through everywhere.
and by the fifth winter, and the sixth, you stitched up the blood,
brought the skin on to the river bends, welcomed that which falls apart,
and were at last capable, with the belief of a stealthy migrant, of understanding
that all is lost yet in another place, and after this in yet another
and that by the end of each morning in another morning
all is uncertain, just like a dandelion in a field of wheat,
as muted as the exhausted vein of the unburied.
in the attic where night and day roam
the wind replies, cutting the chalk and the rye, and the candle,
shimmering in the light of the veiled stars already gone,
trodden, voiceless, swallowed up by the seventh winter,
spears the heart and the ruin — the meridians undress, fly away
in twenty five years that were just kissing yesterday, and be it told or untold
the pleasure that brings a peak of torment, inflicted
by lips that only women know
in the turmoil of varanasi´s death waters,
tests the flame of the merit, endurance and song of
the beginning and the end of your power on earth.",pt_XX,en_XX,"alexander's journey to india
you walked from one side of the earth to the other in your endless life,
you had exiles, pious jealousies, vanished faith,
lovers stopped in the fields, stealing your beloved face.
you saw traces that you were no one's shadow,
shameless eyes, the reflection of irons in the tramp,
fringes of alexander's childish dominion, looking at gaugamela.
you set off from a transitional port to the east,
with emptiness behind, always able to see,
and in the first winter, through the cardinals of your ashes,
you began the crossing that never ends, the story that never ends.
you knew why one glimpses, in tears, the pine tree of youth,
the name broken in a murky air measured without a rope,
and the sea breeze of the wind of favor in the second winter.
in return you pursued what governs the fortuitous man, whispering in marble palaces that are only stones, of the failures to which no one had ever knelt. in the third winter you discovered the hemisphere, and in the fourth, without any idea of ​​war or order to change the kingdom, you chose to adorn the aqueducts under the mantle of the streams, sitting, in the breeze in the tank, at the feverish sunset. of whom you approached, in their interminable path, with no place but that which cools in the cut-out mind, in that which branches out, becoming the web itself, with you spread the duty of passing everywhere. and when the fifth winter came, and the sixth, you sutured the blood,
you brought the skin to the bend of the rivers, you welcomed what was otherwise falling apart,
and you were finally able, in the belief of furtive migrants, to understand that
everything is lost in another place, and after that in another

that shines in the light of veiled stars, already gone,
trodden on, silent, swallowed at the feet of the seventh winter,

in twenty-five years that were just kissing, and whether said or not
the pleasure that inflicts a peak of torments

"a europa em roterdão
dói-me o coração da europa, com as suas veias inchadas
pelo vento do ocidente, e as mãos gretadas pelo gelo
dos invernos. sentei-me com a europa num bar de roterdão,
desenhando na cabeça os mapas do mundo; e obriguei-a
a beber o café holandês, com os seus lábios doentes,
como se a europa não fosse o continente insone
dos últimos milénios, varrido pelos temporais da
mitologia, de crença abalada por um terror ateu.
vi a europa nesse café de roterdão, antes de sair
para as ruas desenhadas a compasso e esquadro;
perguntei-lhe para onde queria ir; e ouvi o seu
murmúrio despir-se de uma palidez plural, como
se ela quisesse ser o rosto único da multidão,
e passear num anonimato de rua cosmopolita,
ouvindo as vozes que lhe falam de ilhas e praias,
restituindo-lhe um sonho de antigas viagens.
vejo nos seus olhos um reflexo das gruas e
guindastes do porto de roterdão, e apago-o com
a borracha da eternidade, para que ela se sente
na esplanada onde lhe peço que me fale; e
ela olha-me, em silêncio, com a voz alucinada
num eco de loucura; e ouço-a dizer-me que
não sabe em que tempo vive, como se fosse
eu que lhe tivesse de ensinar o caminho.
pego na sua mão; e ela desfaz-se nas linhas
improváveis do poema, onde se projecta uma
sombra que eu perco, na noite de roterdão.","europe in rotterdam
the heart of europe is hurting me, with its veins swollen
by the wind out of the west, and its hands cracked by the ice
of winters. i sat down with europe in a rotterdam bar,
drawing the maps of the world in my mind; i made her
drink a dutch coffee, with her sick lips,
as though europe were not the insomniac continent
of the latest millennia, swept by the storms of
mythology, belief shaken by an atheist terror.
i saw europe in that café in rotterdam, before going out
into the streets drawn by compass and set square;
i asked her where she would like to go; and heard her
murmur slip out of her plural paleness, as though
she’d wanted to be the crowd’s single face,
and walk anonymously down the cosmopolitan street,
hearing the voices which speak of to her of islands and beaches,
that restore her dream of ancient voyages.
in her eyes i see a reflection of the cranes and
winches of rotterdam port, and i rub it out
with eternity’s eraser, so that she’ll sit
on the esplanade where i ask her to talk to me; and
she looks at me, in silence, with her voice crazed
by an echo of madness; and i listen to her tell me that
she doesn’t know what period she lives in, as though
it had to be me that had shown her the path.

mais composta em cima do banquinho,

over the sea, looking up ‘gulls’ in the dictionary

to be good, and neither the little saint nor candy,

oh old notebook
in which I wrote my French compositions
mes vacances: I really enjoyed the holidays
je suis allée à la plage (with two ee,
the verb ètre requires agreement), j'ai beaucoup
nagé and then I would finish with the sun setting
in the sea and I would go and see seagulls in the dictionary
the corrections in red and the passé simple,
writing a hundred times nous fûmes vous fûtes ils fûrent
the sunny afternoons
and madame denise who would say toi ma petite
with the air of a sergeant and her angry face turning
red (I have too many blood cells, please pay attention)
and the look that denied everything
in tenderness remplit
and the rules I had memorized and the verb endings
ais, ais, ait,
the extra study time and the late afternoon sun
filtering through the desks,
the nun watching distractedly in psalms
me dreaming with an open book
once upon a time there was a little boy
and the third-degree equations to an
unknown
ah clear afternoons when it was good
to be good, it wasn't the little saint or the candy
it was the sweet word caressing me inside,
the all-white gowns splashed with colorful gouache
and the blue belt that I always wore loose
so falling to the side like a swordsman
the creaking wooden stairs
to the rhythm of the steps, felt still
from a distance of twenty years,
all of us in a submissive line answering the call,
present seemed logical and right to me then
like attending prayer in the chapel and reading the epistles
(from Saint Paul to the Corinthians:
at that time...),
she has a beautiful voice and reads so well, and then
they told me to tighten my belt to be
more composed on top of the little stool,
to the right of the priest
and the fascination of confessions,
the whispered voices in the thin brown wood
hiding a fault,
the smell of the sealed floor and the wax of the candles
and when I stopped believing in sins
and began to think that words are useless
and that it was useless
the web of wood was useless
ah sleepless nights twenty years apart,
once upon a time there was a little boy
and he went up on journey
there was a little girl, une petite fille

"a neve e o amor
neste dia de calor ardente, estou esperando a neve.
sempre estive à sua espera.
quando menino, li recordações da casa dos mortos
e vi a neve caindo na estepe siberiana
e no casaco roto de fédor dostoievski.
amo a neve porque ela não separa o dia da noite
nem afasta o céu das aflições da terra.
une o que está separado:
os passos dos homens condenados ao gelo escurecido
e os suspiros de amor que se perdem no ar.
é necessário ter um ouvido muito afiado
para ouvir a música da neve caindo, algo quase silencioso
como o roçar da asa de um anjo, caso os anjos existissem,
ou o estertor de um pássaro.
não se deve esperar a neve como se espera o amor.
são coisas diferentes. basta abrirmos os olhos para ver a neve
cair no campo desolado. e ela cai em nós, a neve branca e fria
que não queima como o fogo do amor.
para ver o amor os nossos olhos não bastam,
nem os ouvidos, nem a boca, nem mesmo os nossos corações
que batem na escuridão com o mesmo rumor
da neve caindo nas estepes
e nos telhados das cabanas escuras
e no casaco roto de fédor dostoievski.
para ver o amor, nada basta. e tanto o frio do inverno como o calor escaldante
o afastam de nós, de nossos braços abertos
e de nossos corações atormentados.
fiel à minha infância, prefiro ver a neve
que une o céu e a terra, a noite e o dia,
a ser a presa indefesa do amor,
o amor que não é branco nem puro nem frio como a neve.","snow and love

i love snow because it doesn’t separate day from night
or distance heaven from the sufferings of earth.
it unites what’s separate:
the footsteps of those condemned to darkened ice
and sighs of love vanishing in the air.
one has to have a fine-tuned ear
to hear the music of falling snow, something almost silent
like the touch of an angel’s wing, assuming there are angels,
or the dying breath of a bird.
one shouldn’t wait for snow the way one waits for love.
they are different things. it’s enough to open our eyes to see the snow
falling on a deserted field. and it falls on us, cold white snow
that doesn’t burn like the flame of love.

to see love, nothing suffices. both winter cold and searing heat
keep it from us, from our open arms

dizem que vêm da europa central. eu vejo-os vir
dos lados de grijó em lassa caravana.
debaixo da carroça trota a coelheira,
aproveitando a sombra débil e ambulante.
sentado na boleia, as rédeas na mão morena
descuidadas, um homem cisma, confia
do caminho ao macho lento a decisão.
outros homens a pé e mulheres novas
entretêm de riso a caminhada espessa.
logo após, sobre os burros, os pertences.
alguns velhos também, já cansados de tudo,
tiram partido do precário trote. as crianças
de peito sugam em sonolenta teima

de alguma enfermidade menos limpa
e neles cravam dentes de fome milenária.
dizem que as mulheres estão na intimidade
das estrelas e a troco de uns mil-réis
lêem nas mãos destinos coloridos.
dizem que roubam quintais e assaltam capoeiras,
e os aldeões, em pânico secreto,
os expulsam com voz impiedosa e decidida mão
das cercanias do seu chão governado.

em negócios sempre escuros de animais,
em que fazem passar por uma estampa
o mais escalavrado e cego dos cavalos.
dizem que na vila, ao desfazer das feiras,
têm por costume, depois de embriagados,
trocar com as bengalas possantes e vistosas
pancadaria rija, de que morrem.

dizem que não têm deus e que se casam

slackly holding the reins, a man daydreams,
trusting the slow mule to lead the way.

or salons of glory, confined themselves less to the instrument they had mastered most,
and were exiled longer in suffering for a non-existent country.

of becoming a melody for virgins, a rhythm for the castrated,
a sham, a languishing, a nostalgia of illiterates,

a piece de non-résistance for performers who play for those who believe
they like music but really don’t. and what’s more,
he was a parvenu, a pedant sure of an aristocracy he couldn’t claim,
a reactionary anguished over revolutions that would liberate, among others,
the oligarchies of poland – poor things. and, finally,
one begins to suspect he was not even a romantic,
at least not in the sense he pretended or let others believe he was.

concealing the structure, a harmonious melancholy above

that he still passes for an ass of a genius, this man who had thought in his fingers,
whose boldness put on the mask of feeling and free forms

perseguições, e nos casos desvairados de amor não há saída.

as casas que eu fazia em pequeno
onde estarei eu hoje em pequeno?
onde estarei aliás eu dos versos daqui a pouco?
terei eu casa onde reter tudo isto
ou serei sempre somente esta instabilidade?
as casas essas parecem estáveis
mas são tão frágeis as pobres casas
oh as casas as casas as casas
mudas testemunhas da vida
elas morrem não só ao ser demolidas
elas morrem com a morte das pessoas
as casas de fora olham-nos pelas janelas
não sabem nada de casas os construtores
os senhorios os procuradores
os ricos vivem nos seus palácios
mas a casa dos pobres é todo o mundo
os pobres sim têm o conhecimento das casas
os pobres esses conhecem tudo
eu amei as casas os recantos das casas
visitei casas apalpei casas
só as casas explicam que exista
uma palavra como intimidade
sem casas não haveria ruas
as ruas onde passamos pelos outros
mas passamos principalmente por nós
na casa nasci e hei-de morrer
na casa sofri convivi amei
na casa atravessei as estações
respirei – ó vida simples problema de respiração
oh as casas as casas as casas","oh houses houses houses
oh houses houses houses
houses are born and live and die
while alive they stand out from each other
they stand out namely by their smell
they differ even from room to room
ah the houses i built in my childhood
where might i be today in my childhood?
where might i be in a little while from these verses?
will i have a house to store all of this in
or will i always be just this instability?
unlike me houses seem stable
but they’re so fragile poor houses
oh houses houses houses
silent witnesses of life
they die not only when demolished
they die with the death of people
houses look at us through their windows
builders landlords and real estate agents
know nothing about houses
rich people have their palaces
but the house of the poor is the whole world
it’s the poor who know about houses
the poor know everything
i loved houses their nooks and corners
i visited houses i fondled houses
only houses can explain
why a word like intimacy exists
without houses there would be no streets
the streets where we cross paths with others
and especially with ourselves
in a house i was born and i’ll die
in a house i suffered i lived with others i loved
in a house i went through the seasons
i breathed – o life simple problem of respiration
oh houses houses houses",pt_XX,en_XX,"oh the houses the houses the houses

"you are welcome to elsinore
entre nós e as palavras há metal fundente
entre nós e as palavras há hélices que andam
e podem dar-nos morte violar-nos tirar
do mais fundo de nós o mais útil segredo
entre nós e as palavras há perfis ardentes
espaços cheios de gente de costas
altas flores venenosas portas por abrir
e escadas e ponteiros e crianças sentadas
à espera do seu tempo e do seu precipício
ao longo da muralha que habitamos
há palavras de vida há palavras de morte
há palavras imensas, que esperam por nós
e outras, frágeis, que deixaram de esperar
há palavras acesas como barcos
e há palavras homens, palavras que guardam
o seu segredo e a sua posição
entre nós e as palavras, surdamente,
as mãos e as paredes de elsinore
e há palavras nocturnas palavras gemidos
palavras que nos sobem ilegíveis à boca
palavras diamantes palavras nunca escritas
palavras impossíveis de escrever
por não termos connosco cordas de violinos
nem todo o sangue do mundo nem todo o amplexo do ar
e os braços dos amantes escrevem muito alto
muito além do azul onde oxidados morrem
palavras maternais só sombra só soluço
só espasmos só amor só solidão desfeita
entre nós e as palavras, os emparedados
e entre nós e as palavras, o nosso dever falar","you are welcome to elsinore
between us and words there’s molten metal
between us and words there are spinning propellers
that can kill us ravish us wrench
from our inner depths the most worthwhile secret
between us and words there are burning profiles
spaces full of people with their backs turned
tall poisonous flowers closed doors
and stairs and ticking clocks and seated children
waiting for their time and their precipice
along the walls in which we live
there are words of life words of death
there are vast words that wait for us
and other, fragile words that have stopped waiting
there are words lit up like boats
and there are words that are men, words that conceal
their secret and their position
between us and words, without a sound,
the hands and walls of elsinore
and there are words of night words that are moans
illegible words that rise to our lips
diamond words unwritten words
words that can’t be written
because here we don’t have any violin strings
we don’t have all the world’s blood or the air’s whole embrace
and the arms of lovers write high overhead
far beyond the blue where they rust and die
maternal words just shadow just sobbing
just spasms just love just solitude’s dissolution
between us and words those who are walled in,
and between us and words our duty to speak",pt_XX,en_XX,"you are welcome to elsinore
