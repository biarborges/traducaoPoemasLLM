"da menina e moça
pensando-vos estou filha
vossa mãe me está lembrando
enchem-se-me os olhos d’água
nela vos estou lavando:
nascestes filha antre mágoa
para bem filha vos seja
que no vosso nascimento
vos ouve a fortuna inveja:
morto era o contentamento
nenhuma alegria ouvistes,
vossa mãe era finada,
nos outras éamos tristes:
nada em dor em dor crescida
não sei onde isto há de ir ter
vejo-vos filha fermosa
cos olhos verdes crescer:
não era esta graça vossa
para nascer em desterro
mal haja a desaventura
que pôs mais nisto que o erro:
tinha aqui sua sepultura
vossa mãe e mágoa a nós
não éreis vos filha não
para morrerem por vós:
não houve em fados razão
nem se consente rogar
de vosso pai hei mor dó
que de si s’á de queixar:
eu vos ouvi a vós só
primeiro que outrem ninguém
não fôreis vós seu não fora
não sei se fiz mal se bem:
mas não pode ser senhora
para mal nenhum nascerdes
com este riso gracioso
que tendes sobr’olhos verdes:
conforto mais duvidoso
me é este que tomo assi
deus voos dê milhor ventura
da que tevestes té ‘qui:
que a dita e a fermosura
dizem patranhas antigas
que pelejaram um dia
sendo dantes muito amigas:
muitos hão que é fantasia
eu que vi tempos e anos
nenhuma cousa duvido
como ela é caso de danos:
mas nenhum mal nom é crido
o bem só é esperado
e na crença e na esperança
em ambas há i mudança
em ambas há i cuidado","from menina e moça
i’m thinking of you, dear girl,
your mother’s memory haunts me.
my eyes fill up with tears,
they are bathing you gently.
you were born amid sorrow—
may it yet prove a blessing.
since fortune, struck with envy,
singled you out at birth.
gone forever was contentment,
you heard no joyful voices.
your mother’s life had ended,
while ours went on in sadness.
in anguish born and raised!
i don’t know where all this is going.
i’ve watched you grow, my girl,
with green eyes so lovely.
beauty like yours wasn’t meant
to be born in exile. curses on
fate! this was clearly a work
of malevolence, not a mistake.
here lies your mother,
and we languish in grief.
you did nothing, my girl,
to incur a loss so great.
the fates spurn reason,
and will admit no protest.
i pity your poor father,
for the pain he must lament.
i heard you crying, alone,
before anyone else. you’d not
be here, had i not been there.
still, i ask if i did right.
but surely it can’t be wrong
for you to have been born
with that elegant smile of yours,
those dazzling green eyes.
it’s an unlikely comfort
that i take for myself.
may god grant you the grace
that has eluded you till now.
beauty and good fortune,
or so the old story goes,
were once the best of friends,
but became bitterly opposed.
many hold that it’s fantasy,
but in my life i’ve seen
enough not to doubt it:
fate inflicts great damage.
no harm is ever believed;
we always expect the good.
in hoping and believing
lies an element of change,
an element of concern.",pt_XX,en_XX,"of the girl and lass
thinking of you I am daughter
your mother is reminding me
my eyes fill with tears
washing you in her
you were born amidst sorrow
may it be for your good daughter
that at your birth
fortune envied you:
contentment was dead
you heard no joy,
your mother had passed away,
we were all sad:
nothing grown in pain
I don't know where this will lead
I see you, beautiful daughter
growing with green eyes:
this grace was not yours
to be born in exile
ill be the misfortune
that put more into this than error:
your mother had her grave here
and sorrow for us
you were not daughter, no
for them to die for you:
there was no reason in fate
nor is it allowed to plead
for your father I have more pity
than for himself to complain:
I listened to you alone
before anyone else
you were not theirs, it wasn't
I don't know if I did wrong or right:
but it cannot be madam
for you to be born to any harm
with this gracious smile
that you have beneath green eyes:
more doubtful comfort
this that I take like this
may God give you better fortune
than what you've had so far:
for happiness and beauty
old tales say lies
that once they fought
when they were once very friendly:
many think it's fantasy
I, who have seen times and years
doubt nothing
as it is a case of losses:
but no evil is believed
only good is expected
and in belief and hope
in both there is change
in both there is care",4

assents to the sacrifice

sweeping down the ravine,
to the crack of gunshot
and the clang of swords…

the mean, grubby streets
where the frightful throng
erupts in a tumult…
loudly jostling
in savage conflict,
feral gleams in their eyes,
leaping and shouting!
thievery and murder!

in scrappy fistfights…

laughing so hard

not harming me...
unconcerned with vain struggles,
with the seasons of the year.
passing the summer, the autumn,
the pruning, the hoeing, and the harrow,

underneath a stone.

reserves me a bed
in the vast and shallow meadow
just beneath the grass

and, slender, at intervals
let the gallop
of bands of horses whip me.
or in the mountainous brush,
so conducive to fights,
where harsh living
leads to sacrifice
of lives, hard deaths
tumble down the gullies,
with clashing of armor
and ringing of swords...
or even under the ground,
infamous and vile of the street,
where the sullen rabble
bursts forth, tumults,
twists, shouts,
savage in conflicts,
with ferocious impulses
in their eyes, leaps, shouts...
robberies, murders!
never peaceful hours,
in brutal brawls
jawbones fracture...
and I under the solid,
compact, trodden earth,
very quietly. laughing
because nothing hurts me.",4

[sobre a fotografia de uma criança encontrada morta numa praia da turquia]
o meu pai chamou-me e pediu-me que escolhesse
um brinquedo – só um – de que gostasse muito; e
que separasse outro brinquedo para o aylan, que
ainda não sabia escolher, mas só um, e tinha de
ser pequeno. o meu pai explicou-me que nessa
noite ia fazer de tudo quase nada numa trouxa
leve; porque assim, quando o aylan e eu caíssemos
de sono, ele e a minha mãe poderiam levar-nos ao
colo sem ficarem para trás. havia lágrimas nos olhos
do meu pai quando contou que, na manhã seguinte,
teríamos de deixar a nossa terra; mas logo se
recompôs, dizendo que kobanî também já não era
bem a nossa terra, que a nossa casa era a ruína da
nossa casa, que toda a síria não passava de um tímpano
exausto de tanto estrondo e dois olhos cansados,
mas tão cansados, de chamas e de sangue. o meu pai
achava que o aylan era demasiado pequeno para
compreender e, por isso, dissera-lhe apenas que
iríamos dar um passeio de barco, que passaríamos
o dia numa praia e que, enquanto eu e a minha mãe
nadássemos no mar até ficarmos sem fôlego, ele
podia simplesmente deitar-se de bruços na areia,
como tanto gostava. o meu pai nunca nos mentiu.","lungs
[on a photograph of a child found dead on a beach in turkey]
my father called me over and told me to pick out
a toy – just one – that i liked the most; and
to pick out another toy for aylan, who
was still too young to choose, but just one, and
it had to be small. my father told me that
tonight he’d wrap up our things in a light
bundle; this way, once aylan and i fell
asleep, he and my mother could carry us
without staying behind. there were tears in my father’s
eyes when he said that, tomorrow morning,
we’d have to leave our land; but he quickly
pulled it together, saying kobanî wasn’t really
our land anymore, that our home was the ruins
of our home, that all of syria was nothing but an eardrum
exhausted from all the noise and two eyes, tired,
so tired, of seeing flames and blood. my father
thought aylan was too little to
understand, so he just told him that
we were going on a boat ride, that we’d spend
the day on a beach and that, while my mother and i
swam in the sea until we were breathless, he
could simply lie face down in the sand,
as he loved to do so much. my father never lied to us.",pt_XX,en_XX,"lungs

"tempo e memória
em qualquer momento, no começo e no fim,
na medida de toda a vida, prostrados de toda a pena,
permanecemos sem amanhã nem princípio,
esbatidos na idade e na distância, saqueados na mentira,
apenas juntando a areia ao fundo de um recreio,
riscando a areia escorada do nosso entendimento,
a simular um amuleto contra o regresso impossível.
não temos trégua, não podemos voltar, e sem
ruído afastamo-nos para onde de longe chamamos
no ar rarefeito, entre os ramos, dos plátanos de ontem,

em quantas inumeráveis semelhanças com a morte.

we shift away towards there where we call from afar

in so many countless death similes.
sensing decay, this intimate decline of all there is,
fully aware of incertitude as the exhibited sign of memory

onde estão as verdadeiras lágrimas, que as não vemos?

decorrido que foi o langor de sons pela geada, que
bem remanesce no contorno puído de cidades
– que graça confessamos ter decididamente tocado?
viemos de longe, de patíbulos que ninguém contará,
evocando pontos brumosos e vagas escolhas,
a custo apartados da dor de uma época a outra sobrepondo-se,
para ver enfim esquivas as mansardas donde partimos
– ainda a maioria sorria nos terreiros, tantos anos –
e perceber que o caminho se faz lançando mão
ao que dele continuamente resvala, inaudível – apagando-se.

imersos no ruído de fundo de uma escadaria,
pouco a pouco premindo a vida ao tamanho último,

Evoking misty points and vague choices,
Barely separated from the pain of one era overlapping with another,
To finally see elusive the garrets from which we departed
- Most still smiled in the courtyards, so many years -
And to realize that the path is made by grasping
What continually slips from it, inaudible - fading away.
Time is being abolished, it is the time of flame on water,
And we have often drifted from the greater to the more just,
Immersed in the background noise of a staircase,
Gradually pressing life into its ultimate size,

In which only a retreat, like climbing a flight of stairs,
Is the root of what we have done for ourselves,
The joy that emanates after captivity.",4

espezinhada, por onde em grupos, sob os plátanos, já
na voz cabia a tremura que vinha de ceira rente aos cabelos –
“que só nos convirá em sorte acenar, acenar sempre, e sem remorso,
pois que é no que perdido foi que fomos deixando que se viva.”
por que ousaremos então mentir, gentil companheiro?
valerá o esforço em simular, a nossos pobres seguidores,
que nas saudações mais não estamos do que a compensar o nosso medo?
mentiremos sim, mas por razões distintas, algumas as referiste,

a linha que da vida fomos consentindo que se faça.

e haver árvores ao fim da rua

regressa e entrar humildemente por engano pela morte dentro

que era o verão a única estação

e não soubemos ir até ao fundo da verdura

happy the man who manages sadness wisely
and learns to divide it among the days
though months and years pass it will never leave him

the blue equilibrium of summer’s sheer mornings
by the ocean that overflows with us
in the long farewell of our condition
it is sad to see in the garden the sun’s solitude
reaching from the city’s houses and din
to a distant hint of river
and the meager life meted out to us
it is sadder to have to be born and to die
and to have trees at the end of the street

returning and to enter humbly into death by mistake

was the only season
