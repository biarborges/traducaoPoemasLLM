There are no places, never were, not even ancient ones.
There's what we look at, their mark of brick dust that makes them vanish.
Only thus do we reach. Only softly, to remember.
Not to touch the lilac columns or cross on the tangerine's sailboat.
We only wander vaguely. We don't walk, beneath the sun.
The nomads' feet don't darken with sand nor small ports' waters.
It's the elm trees that shield us, not their terraces.
The dust mark wounds us in a faded droplet,
We can entertain it even between fingers that don't petrify.
Nothing changed since the first complaint; we left
With our eyes along the Mediterranean line
And the olive trees are its diurnal boundary.",0
"nada existe que não tivesse começado.
mesmo na lonjura, decisiva porção iluminada,
em territórios despojados de todo o fim, em
areais de mares a desaguar desconhecidamente,
mais não olhamos senão a extensão do que vimos.
se campos da livónia vão dar a campos da mazúria,
se mosaicos amaciam na água de banhos mornos,
e além houver só cemitérios seguindo cemitérios, e
a meio deles, parado sem vento, o bosque de bétulas,
se o sol é o lume do azeite a esmiolar o pão
ou o clarão lascado nas muralhas de helsingør,
se o enredo da morte é igual em toda a parte,
seja na flauta de santa maria ou no gaiteiro de tallinn,
é porque modulamos num lugar o que lastrou de outro.
mesmo sem querer, ou sejam sombras afastando-se,
mais não tecemos que a linha de acasos e acertos
que uma corrente conduz, a cada um, em separado,
à passagem mais sensível do acabamento.
mesmo isolando os lugares numa função laboriosa,
detalhando as suas divergências, e as pontas extremas
— a parecença entre o que são e o que pensámos serem,
mesmo nas regiões cruzadas por comboios extensos,
onde a noite cairá em escamas de lavanda,
seguiremos a mesma história — afundamos os pés no mesmo solo.
naquilo por que vamos repetidamente levados,
ansiando o que se manifeste acolá na próxima enseada,
alisando com a mão os castanheiros onde inscrevemos, depois
de outros, nossos sinuosos nomes, nossos amores,
sempre tornamos ao ponto em que tudo se repete e inicia,
de que atingimos apenas um minuto só — um instante,
a lâmina que medeia o ano que passa e o ano que vem.","nothing exists that hasn’t had a beginning.
nothing exists that hasn’t had a beginning.
even in the distance, a clear lit speck,
in territories stripped from all limits, on
sands that flow from unknown seas,
we only contemplate the extent of what we perceived.
if fields in livonia lead to fields in masuria,
if tiles are smoothed in tepid bath waters,
and further on graveyard follows graveyard, and
in their midst, inert in the lack of wind, the birch wood stands,
if the sun is the flame of the olive oil crumbling the bread
or the chipped lightening on the walls of helsingør,
if the death plot is everywhere the same,
be it in the santa maria flute or in the tallinn concertina
it is because we modulate in one place what has seeped from another.
even unwillingly, or perhaps it’s the shadows on the move,
we weave no more than a row of chances and discretions
along a current which takes each one of us, separately,
to the most sensitive final passage.
even if laboriously we detach the places,
detailing their diversions and extremes
— the similarity between what they are and what we thought they were,
even throughout regions intersected by extensive trains,
where night will fall in scales of lavender,
we’ll follow the same story — we sink our feet in the same mud.
in that which repeatedly sucks us in,
as we yearn for whatever comes to pass further in the next cove
smoothing with our hands the oak trees on whose bark we inscribe,
like others before us, our sinuous names, our loves,
we constantly return to the point where all is repeated and begun,
of which we grasp a mere minute — an instant,
the blade mediating between this year and the next.",pt_XX,en_XX,"nothing exists that hadn't begun.

in territories stripped of all end, on
sandbanks where seas flow unknown,

whether mosaics soften in the warm bath water,
and beyond lie only cemeteries following cemeteries, and
midway, windless, the birchwood,
whether the sun is the oil lamp splitting the bread
or the gleam chipped off the walls of elsinore,
if the plot of death is the same everywhere,
whether in the flute of santa maria or the piper of tallinn,
it's because we modulate in one place what ballasted from another.
even without wanting, whether shadows receding,
we weave only the thread of chance and accuracy
that a chain leads, to each one, in isolation,
to the most sensitive passage of completion.
even isolating places in a laborious function,
detailing their differences, and the extreme ends

na sombra das folhas de nossos passos
sob um manto de nuvens o dia escureceu; o outono
gerou e apagou novas e efémeras

longe envoltos no orvalho de um doce sofrimento,

que amámos teceram palavras esquecidas; e a vida,
seguindo e caindo sem fim, pareceu apagar-se
como espuma numa recordação fugaz, um bloco de gelo,
transparente, esculpindo e transformando os aspectos do tempo ou
que os gansos agarravam com as asas as frágeis
penas do seu ser, as faziam estilhaçar.
mas era justamente por os anos passados pesarem
sobre nós, voltarem, ou desaparerem, que as terras e os
vales se sentia que suspiravam, que marcavam grãos de areia
no rosto, como outrora em connemara; que se sentia que a natureza
estava prestes a transformar-se, que a nossa sombra estava
prestes a desaparecer; que a neve caía, ia caindo, a neve dos teixos
deixando passar a neve; e que o inverno chegava com
as suas raízes escoradas pela água, e que a ronda do ano
dava outra volta fortuita na charneca, outra volta
na primavera e no verão; outro sopro do seu espírito, como um
gerânio que as pétalas desenham num curso incessante, invisível, e caíssem

about to disappear; the snow was falling, kept falling, the yew snow

na hora em que eu mais ruía
o sol aplainava o relvado, palmeiras
ondulavam num lago turvo

da juventude

o verão começando pelo fim
horas extraordinárias aquelas
em que as aves adiavam o repouso por causa
dos insectos do turno sequente
ourados absortos estrepitantes

a bicicleta sobre a falta
e se sentava na relva prendendo as lágrimas
as mãos tapando o rosto o rosto entre os geolhos e uma
roda atrás a girar

sujo já por um grafito de província

perfume dos jantares

e fartura – belo desastroso feroz – lugar de forças
e destruições

puro intrínseco
procurava um celeiro urbano onde guardar
o ouro-sémen pronto a detonar
a libélula extrema o grilo inicial
a andorinha cujo ninho resulta de um cúmulo
de lama e ervas secas e rasoira

nas minhas costas o exíguo refrigério
da biblioteca pública

repousando da luta de guerrilha

pedaços da mesma ideia:
redonda achatada nos polos insegura no seu tombo
escuridão afora
a cabeça pendular metida entre ombros

na órbita do absurdo a cumprir a curvatura que lhe cabe

pascendo
o vale da sombra da morte.
e a questão hoje é: who’s gonna drive you home tonight?

a subir em tubos estreitos

dejected centres of irregular gravitation.

i didn’t tell you), the pleiades lighting up
my hades
with its flashing little goats
grazing
in the valley of the shadow of death.
and now the question is: who’s gonna drive you home tonight?

to rise inside narrow tubes

Gain anything.
Yet this hasn't stopped me from seeing Pleiades
Each time you appeared—silent—
Pleiades that light my Hades,
With their sparkling kids grazing
In the valley of the shadow of death.

In narrow tubes than mercury?

ave-marias
nas nossas ruas, ao anoitecer,
há tal soturnidade, há tal melancolia,
que as sombras, o bulício, o tejo, a maresia
despertam-me um desejo absurdo de sofrer.
o céu parece baixo e de neblina,
o gás extravasado enjoa-me, perturba;
e os edifícios, com as chaminés, e a turba
toldam-se duma cor monótona e londrina.
batem carros de aluguer, ao fundo,
levando à via-férrea os que se vão. felizes!
ocorrem-me em revista exposições, países:
madrid, paris, berlim, s. petersburgo, o mundo!
semelham-se a gaiolas, com viveiros,
as edificações somente emadeiradas:
como morcegos, ao cair das badaladas,
saltam de viga em viga os mestres carpinteiros.
voltam os calafates, aos magotes,
de jaquetão ao ombro, enfarruscados, secos;
embrenho-me, a cismar, por boqueirões, por becos,
ou erro pelos cais a que se atracam botes.
e evoco, então, as crónicas navais:
mouros, baixéis, heróis, tudo ressuscitado!
luta camões no sul, salvando um livro a nado!
singram soberbas naus que eu não verei jamais!
e o fim da tarde inspira-me; e incomoda!
de um couraçado inglês vogam os escaleres;
e em terra num tinir de louças e talheres
flamejam, ao jantar alguns hotéis da moda.
num trem de praça arengam dois dentistas;
um trôpego arlequim braceja numas andas;
os querubins do lar flutuam nas varandas;
às portas, em cabelo, enfadam-se os lojistas!
vazam-se os arsenais e as oficinas;
reluz, viscoso, o rio, apressam-se as obreiras;
e num cardume negro, hercúleas, galhofeiras,
correndo com firmeza, assomam as varinas.
vêm sacudindo as ancas opulentas!
seus troncos varonis recordam-me pilastras;
e algumas, à cabeça, embalam nas canastras
os filhos que depois naufragam nas tormentas.
descalças! nas descargas de carvão,
desde manhã à noite, a bordo das fragatas;
e apinham-se num bairro aonde miam gatas,
e o peixe podre gera os focos de infecção!

noite fechada
toca-se às grades, nas cadeias. som
que mortifica e deixa umas loucuras mansas!
o aljube, em que hoje estão velhinhas e crianças,
bem raramente encerra uma mulher de “dom”!
e eu desconfio, até, de um aneurisma
tão mórbido me sinto, ao acender das luzes;
à vista das prisões, da velha sé, das cruzes,
chora-me o coração que se enche e que se abisma.
a espaços, iluminam-se os andares,
e as tascas, os cafés, as tendas, os estancos
alastram em lençol os seus reflexos brancos;
e a lua lembra o circo e os jogos malabares.
duas igrejas, num saudoso largo,
lançam a nódoa negra e fúnebre do clero:
nelas esfumo um ermo inquisidor severo,
assim que pela história eu me aventuro e alargo.
na parte que abateu no terremoto,
muram-me as construções rectas, iguais, crescidas;
afrontam-me, no resto, as íngremes subidas,
e os sinos dum tanger monástico e devoto.
mas, num recinto público e vulgar,
com bancos de namoro e exíguas pimenteiras,
brônzeo, monumental, de proporções guerreiras,
um épico doutrora ascende, num pilar!
e eu sonho o cólera, imagino a febre,
nesta acumulação de corpos enfezados;
sombrios e espectrais recolhem os soldados;
inflama-se um palácio em face de um casebre.
partem patrulhas de cavalaria
dos arcos dos quartéis que foram já conventos;
idade média! a pé, outras, a passos lentos,
derramam-se por toda a capital, que esfria.
triste cidade! eu temo que me avives
uma paixão defunta! aos lampiões distantes,
enlutam-me, alvejando, as tuas elegantes,
curvadas a sorrir às montras dos ourives.
e mais: as costureiras, as floristas
descem dos magasins, causam-me sobressaltos;
custa-lhes a elevar os seus pescoços altos
e muitas delas são comparsas ou coristas.
e eu, de luneta de uma lente só,
eu acho sempre assunto a quadros revoltados:
entro na brasserie; às mesas de emigrados,
ao riso e à crua luz joga-se o dominó.

ao gás
e saio. a noite pesa, esmaga. nos
passeios de lajedo arrastam-se as impuras.
ó moles hospitais! sai das embocaduras
um sopro que arripia os ombros quase nus.
cercam-me as lojas, tépidas. eu penso
ver círios laterais, ver filas de capelas,
com santos e fiéis, andores, ramos, velas,
em uma catedral de um comprimento imenso.
as burguesinhas do catolicismo
resvalam pelo chão minado pelos canos;
e lembram-me, ao chorar doente dos pianos,
as freiras que os jejuns matavam de histerismo.
num cutileiro, de avental, ao torno,
um forjador maneja um malho, rubramente;
e de uma padaria exala-se, inda quente,
um cheiro salutar e honesto a pão no forno.
e eu que medito um livro que exacerbe,
quisera que o real e a análise mo dessem;
casas de confecções e modas resplandecem;
pelas vitrines olha um ratoneiro imberbe.
longas descidas! não poder pintar
com versos magistrais, salubres e sinceros,
a esguia difusão dos vossos reverberos,
e a vossa palidez romântica e lunar!
que grande cobra, a lúbrica pessoa,
que espartilhada escolhe uns xales com debuxo!
sua excelência atrai, magnética, entre luxo,
que ao longo dos balcões de mogno se amontoa.
e aquela velha, de bandós! por vezes,
a sua traîne imita um leque antigo, aberto,
nas barras verticais, a duas tintas. perto,
escarvam, à vitória, os seus mecklemburgueses.
desdobram-se tecidos estrangeiros;
plantas ornamentais secam nos mostradores;
flocos de pós de arroz pairam sufocadores,
e em nuvens de cetins requebram-se os caixeiros.
mas tudo cansa! apagam-se nas frentes
os candelabros, como estrelas, pouco a pouco;
da solidão regouga um cauteleiro rouco;
tornam-se mausoléus as armações fulgentes.
“dó da miséria!... compaixão de mim!...”
e, nas esquinas, calvo, eterno, sem repouso,
pede-me esmola um homenzinho idoso,
meu velho professor nas aulas de latim!

estende-se ao comprido, ao meio das trapeiras;
vêm lágrimas de luz dos astros com olheiras,
enleva-me a quimera azul de transmigrar.
por baixo, que portões! que arruamentos!
um parafuso cai nas lajes, às escuras:
colocam-se taipais, rangem as fechaduras,
e os olhos dum caleche espantam-me, sangrentos.
e eu sigo, como as linhas de uma pauta
a dupla correnteza augusta das fachadas;
pois sobem, no silêncio, infaustas e trinadas,
as notas pastoris de uma longínqua flauta.
se eu não morresse, nunca! e eternamente
buscasse e conseguisse a perfeição das cousas!
esqueço-me a prever castíssimas esposas,
que aninhem em mansões de vidro transparente!
ó nossos filhos! que de sonhos ágeis,
pousando, vos trarão a nitidez às vidas!
eu quero as vossas mães e irmãs estremecidas,
numas habitações translúcidas e frágeis.
ah! como a raça ruiva do porvir,
e as frotas dos avós, e os nómadas ardentes,
nós vamos explorar todos os continentes
e pelas vastidões aquáticas seguir!
mas se vivemos, os emparedados,
sem árvores, no vale escuro das muralhas!...
julgo avistar, na treva, as folhas das navalhas
e os gritos de socorro ouvir estrangulados.
e nestes nebulosos corredores
nauseiam-me, surgindo, os ventres das tabernas;
na volta, com saudade, e aos bordos sobre as pernas,
cantam, de braço dado, uns tristes bebedores.
eu não receio, todavia, os roubos;
afastam-se, a distância, os dúbios caminhantes;
e sujos, sem ladrar, ósseos, febris, errantes,
amareladamente, os cães parecem lobos.
e os guardas, que revistam as escadas,
caminham de lanterna e servem de chaveiros;
por cima, as imorais, nos seus roupões ligeiros,

To live in luminous, fragile homes.
Ah! Like our grandfathers' fleets, like fervent
Nomads, like the ruddy race to come,
We'll go and explore every continent
And sail across the watery expanses!
But how, if we live enclosed by stone
In a dark and treeless valley of walls?
I think I see knives flash in the shadows
And hear a strangled cry for help.
And along these murky corridors
The taverns, if I peer in, appall me.
Some sorry drunks are staggering home
And sing, arms joined, for old time's sake.
But I'm not afraid of being robbed;
The dubious characters fall behind me.
The scrawny and mangy dogs don't bark;
They look a little like yellowish wolves.
And those keepers of keys, the night watchmen,
Scan with their lanterns each entryway;
Above them loose women, in scanty robes,
Smoke and cough at the balcony windows.
And looming out of that jagged mass
Of tomblike buildings tall as hills,
Human pain, like a baleful sea,
Seeks vast horizons for its bitter tides!",0

You sit on the threshold of days alone,
Just with the courtesy of your gestures.
A window open to the landscape of your life,
Rocks where you rest your gaze for a moment
Under the dome of the sky, which for you
Closes its lids at night before sleep.
If only you could be not under the moon, sleeping
Beside you like a corpse! In vain
Your arms wield the sword of its light
As one who dreams to deny the world around:
The leaves that establish with you a language,
The wind that weaves patterns over the sea,
An osier that bends the knees as if by the
Evening's ritual, and the reeds that sway
A futile bow to you who arrive, to you who leave, without words,
The beak of an owl pointing out the darkness.
What's the point of speaking? These steps
Already know that you scatter over the childhood of paths,
Examining the fate of stars in the heights.
Why write your name there? No one
Will notice the absence, in the certainty of a world
From which you cannot return, you, guest of honor
To witness the end of all things,
You wait to join the others in the fire with your ashes.",0

nem mar: só o ruído dos carros entrava pelas fendas
para ecoar no tecto (madeiras à vista entre os restos
de estuque). depois, na rua, pendurou-se nos ferros podres
de antigas varandas. percebia-se, por entre os arbustos
que invadiam tudo, uma vista que teria sido digna
de um quadro romântico. o vale, coberto de casas, e
os montes invadidos por ferro-velho, ocultam um passado
de rebanhos e pastores. mas talvez não se tenha ouvido aqui

a guardar antigos silêncios, que o uso transformou em manchas

no inverno, escondidos do universo. mas alguém passou por aqui,

"receita para fazer azul
se quiseres fazer azul,
pega num pedaço de céu e mete-o numa panela grande,
que possas levar ao lume do horizonte;
depois mexe o azul com um resto de vermelho
da madrugada, até que ele se desfaça;
despeja tudo num bacio bem limpo,
para que nada reste das impurezas da tarde.
por fim, peneira um resto de ouro da areia
do meio-dia, até que a cor pegue ao fundo de metal.
se quiseres, para que as cores se não desprendam
com o tempo, deita no líquido um caroço de pêssego queimado.
vê-lo-ás desfazer-se, sem deixar sinais de que alguma vez
ali o puseste; e nem o negro da cinza deixará um resto de ocre
na superfície dourada. podes, então, levantar a cor
até à altura dos olhos, e compará-la com o azul autêntico.
ambas as cores te parecerão semelhantes, sem que
possas distinguir entre uma e outra.
assim o fiz – eu, abraão ben judá ibn haim,
iluminador de loulé – e deixei a receita a quem quiser,
algum dia, imitar o céu.","recipe for making the colour blue
if you wish to make the colour blue
take a piece of sky and put it in a pot
large enough to place on the flame of the horizon.
stir into the blue a pinch of early morning red
until it dissolves. pour everything
into a brass bowl that has been well washed
to eliminate all of the afternoon’s impurities.
finally, sift in a few smidgens of gold from the sand
of midday until the colour adheres to the bottom of the bowl.
to prevent the colours from separating with time,
drop a charred peach pit into the liquid.
it will disintegrate, leaving no telltale
sign, not even – from the black ash – an ochre trace
on the golden surface. you may then raise the colour
to eye level and compare it with genuine blue.
the two colours will look so alike
that you cannot distinguish one from the other.
this was how i did it – i, abraham ben judah ibn haim,
illuminator from the town of loulé. and i left the recipe
for whoever, one day, would imitate the sky.",pt_XX,en_XX,"recipe for making blue

take a piece of sky and place it in a large pot,

so that nothing remains of the impurities of the evening.
finally, sift some gold dust from the sand
of midday, until the color sets on the metal base.
if you wish, so that the colors do not fade
over time, add to the liquid a scorched peach pit.
you will see it dissolve, without leaving signs that it was ever
there; and not even the black of ash will leave a trace of ochre
on the golden surface. you can then raise the color
to the height of your eyes, and compare it with the authentic blue.

you being able to distinguish between one and the other.

the plum tree and the windstay bush
give you not only images of the image
but also their fallen petals,
so that the archetype overlies the image.
and not only from the plant kingdom,
o ancient tank, do figures visit your mirror;
fishes, birds and insects pass
in the whole time where you preserve
the signs of the past and present.
so many things have passed, and yet i forget
that we pass, that only this water
enclosed in its circle and flowing
has a mobile and immobile force
that pulls me from age to age.
steadily gushing, it leaves by the channel
at ground level, spreading over the fields.
and time is spent like water,
which never holds the same mirror
for the images that come and go.",pt_XX,en_XX,"Of things
Not all things mark us
With tenacity in their halos.
Many hide or don't return to us
The thought with which we had desired them.
Oh thing imagined, reflection on water,
Oh basin containing the story of time,
Hour by hour through the four seasons.
You have winter, summer, spring
And especially the perfect autumn, so motionless.
And the moss spore and the plum tree
Not only give you the images of the image
But cast the loose petals
For the archetype to fall upon the image.
And not only from the plant kingdom the figures
Visit your mirror, oh ancient basin,
As fish, birds, and insects
Pass, in the whole time you hold
The signs of the past and present.
So much has passed without me remembering
That we pass, only this water
Stopped in its circle and to trickle away
Has a mobile and immobile force
That pulls me from age to age.
Continuously it gushes, and exits through the drain
Shallow to the ground, spread on the lands.
And time is spent like water
That never holds within itself the same mirror
For the images coming and lost.",0
