"carta ao pai
agora que o senhor
mais assemelha pedaço
de carne com dois olhos
dirigidos ao teto escuro
no leito em que provável
só não há-de morrer só
porque nem a própria
saliva poderá engolir
por si na companhia
somente desta sonda

em validade a proibição
da mãe em confessar
ao senhor os hábitos
amorosos das mucosas
que são minhas
e se deveras me amaria

quanta fricção já tiveram
que não lhes cabia
biológica ou religiosa
-mente e se também
pediria para sua filhoa
a morte que desejou
a tantos de minha laia
quando surgiam na tela
da glboo da record
da manchete do sbt
que sempre constituíram
seu cordão umbilical
com a tradição
e se deveras faria
sobrevir a eles
grande destruição
pela violência
com que urrava
seus xingamentos
típicos de macho
nascido no interior
desse pais de machos
interiores e quebrados
em seus orgulhos falhos
de crer que o pai
é o que abarrota
geladeiras e não deixa
que falte à mesa
o alimento que nutre
as mesmas mucosas
em que corre
o seu sangre
mas não seu deus
e ora neste leito partido
o cérebro em veias
como riachos insistentes
em correr
fora das margens
se o senhor
soubesse o dolo
com que manchei
a mesa
de todos os patriarcas
ainda pergunto-me
se me receberia
com a mansidão
que aceita na testa
o beijo desta sua filhoa
que nada mais é
que a sua imagem
e semelhança invertidas
tal espelho
que refletisse opostos
de gênero e religião
ou o desenho
animado na infância
de uma sala de justiça
onde numa tela
podia-se observar
um mundo ao avesso
e se o pai e o pai
odeiam deveras
o gerado nas normas
da biologia e religião

na transgressão das leis
que o pai e o pai
impõem-nos na ciência
de sermos todos falhos

é tão frequente
que gere prazer

com essas pupilas

de carne

"morticínio ancestral
quando minha avó torcia o pescoço
dos frangos, não raras vezes
chegando a decapitá-los,
e os lançava ao chão frio de cimento
para aquela dança assustadora,
não havia em seu rosto
paixão, prazer, ou pena.
na escuridão escondida dentro do meio-dia,
aqueles morticínios eram os atos
mais honestos na violência
daquela casa e daquela infância.
afogando na água fervente
os cadáveres sem cabeça
[que ficara de banda no quintal
interrogando seu criador],
ela passava a depená-los, ágil,
qual fosse ela um gavião-pedrês.
como o cafuné do crânio da onça
no crânio da capivara,
ou o abraço anelar das garras do carcará
ao redor do corpo todo-torso da cobra,
nada naquela velha
era cogitado
para além da missão simples:
alimentar a prole.
como todo animal que não questiona
a cadeia alimentar diante da fome,
minha avó foi o bicho mais inocente
da minha casa e da minha selva.
mais do que os gatos e pombos,
mais do que os jabutis e coelhos,
com certeza
era mais inocente minha avó
do que as cachorras da casa,
aquelas cachorras grandes e gordas
com os dentes afiados — mas inúteis,
esperando também daquela mamífera-anciã
que manchasse ela as mãos de sangue.","ancestral slaughter
when my grandmother used to wring
the necks of chickens, not infrequently
to the point of decapitation,
and dropped them to the cold cement floor
and that shocking dance,
on her face there was no trace
of passion, pleasure, or pity.
in the darkness hidden within the noonday,
those killings were the most honest acts
in the violence of that house,
that childhood.
after plunging into boiling water
those headless corpses
[who’d stood in brood in the yard
questioning their creator],
she began to pluck them, with all
the agility of a gray-lined hawk.
like the caress of the jaguar’s skull
on the capybara’s, or the annulate
embrace of the caracara’s claws
on a snake’s all-torso body,
nothing in that old woman
was cognized
beyond a simple mission:
to feed her offspring.
as any animal does not question
the food chain in the face of hunger,
my grandmother was of all animals
the most innocent in my house
and in my forest.
more than cats and pigeons,
more than tortoises and rabbits,
this is far more certain:
my grandmother was more innocent
even than our household dogs,
our big, fat dogs
with sharp — but useless — teeth,
also waiting for that age-old mammal
to drench her hands in blood.",pt_XX,en_XX,"ancestral slaughter

and gave an animal with golden fur

who had taken her breath away. but he
also wanted a throne, a second
wife and a country to rule.
when a sorceress weeps she invokes
demons who invoke curses.

the tragic words: i wanted nothing
for myself, i did it all for you.
and the course of the world entertains
the audience, the crime’s accomplices,
those it profited and those it petrified.
and tears roll with each free motion,
and the acuteness of her suffering softens
our shock. the cloak she weaves
smothers with flames, and the spurting
blood and burning flesh truly excite us.
what remains is a pair of infant corpses
at their father’s feet: the sky is empty
and no one has yet left the hall.

de cada vez que o invadia, a enxurrada da memória ascendia-lhe assim a um tal nível da consciência que os seus próprios ossos, deixando de ser pontos fixos e estáveis aos quais ele se pudesse segurar, vinham, desmantelados, boiar à superfície das águas borrascosas, de mistura

e a ela só por prémio pretendia.
os dias, na esperança de um só dia,
passava, contentando-se com vê-la;
porém o pai, usando de cautela
em lugar de raquel lhe dava lia.
vendo o triste pastor que com enganos
lhe fora assi negada a sua pastora,
como se a não tivera merecida;
começa de servir outros sete anos,
dizendo: — mais servira, se não fora
para tão longo amor tão curta a vida.","jacob
for seven years, the shepherd jacob slaved
for the father of beautiful rachel, working not for the man,
but only for her, knowing ever since he began
that she alone was the only reward he craved.
his days, dreaming of the wedding that lay ahead,
passed by, content to see her from time to time,
until her father plotted his duplicitous crime,
by placing leah in jacob’s marriage bed.
learning the cruel deception, jacob, in tears,
had lost the one he loved, as if, somehow,
he hadn’t truly earned the proper wife.
but he starts all over again, for seven more years,
saying, “if life wasn’t so short, beginning right now,
i\'d serve even longer for rachel, the love of my life.”",pt_XX,en_XX,"seven years as shepherd Jacob served,
Laban, father of Rachel, fair to see;
but not for Laban served, but for her,
and her alone as prize he earnestly desired.
the days, in hope of just one day,
he passed, contenting himself just to look upon her;
but father, cunning and so wary,
instead of Rachel, Leah he gave to him.
seeing the shepherd sad, deceived by tricks,
denied his love, as if he had not rightfully deserved her;
he starts to serve another seven years,
saying: — I would have served more, were it not for
the short life for such a long love.",5
"abdicação
toma-me, ó noite eterna, nos teus braços
e chama-me teu filho. eu sou um rei
que voluntariamente abandonei
o meu trono de sonhos e cansaços.
minha espada, pesada a braços lassos,
em mãos viris e calmas entreguei,
e meu ceptro e coroa — eu os deixei
na antecâmara, feitos em pedaços.
minha cota de malha, tão inútil,
minhas esporas, de um tinir tão fútil,
deixei-as pela fria escadaria.
despi a realeza, corpo e alma,
e regressei à noite antiga e calma
como a paisagem ao morrer do dia.","abdication
o night eternal, call me your son
and take me into your arms. i’m a king
who relinquished, willingly,
my throne of dreams and tedium.
my sword, which dragged my weak arms down,
i surrendered to strong and steady hands,
and in the anteroom i abandoned
my shattered scepter and crown.
my spurs that jingled to no avail
and my useless coat of mail
i left on the cold stone steps.
i took off royalty, body and soul,
and returned to the night so calm, so old,
like the landscape when the sun sets.",pt_XX,en_XX,"renunciation

in the antechamber. my armor,
useless now, my spurs, with their
futile jingle, i cast down
the cold staircase. i stripped away
my kingship, body and soul,

"retrato de uma princesa desconhecida
para que ela tivesse um pescoço tão fino
para que os seus pulsos tivessem um quebrar de caule
para que os seus olhos fossem tão frontais e limpos
para que a sua espinha fosse tão direita
e ela usasse a cabeça tão erguida
com uma tão simples claridade sobre a testa
foram necessárias sucessivas gerações de escravos
de corpo dobrado e grossas mãos pacientes
servindo sucessivas gerações de príncipes

para que ela fosse aquela perfeição
solitária exilada sem destino","portrait of an unknown princess

for her wrists to bend like flower stems

her back so straight
her head so high
with such a natural glow on her forehead

with stooping bodies and patient rough hands
serving successive generations of princes

cruel greedy and conniving
it took an enormous squandering of life

that lonely exiled aimless perfection",pt_XX,en_XX,"portrait of an unknown princess

escorraçadas do pecado e do sagrado

the soup that boils over
