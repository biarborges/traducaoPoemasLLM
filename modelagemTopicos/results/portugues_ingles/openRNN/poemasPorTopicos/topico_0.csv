"uma canção póstuma para paul celan

até nas ondas do meio-dia, na linha calma das cerejas, se te vejo, margarete — eu « escureço — «e escureço
como o cabelo com o tom escuro dos violinos me escurece, como
escurece o vento nos bosques frios em que morremos, escurecem as alamedas
escurece o leite negro que bebemos e bebemos.
onde vieres também tu pelo adordo sublime do infortúnio, nem que franzido seja o teu sangue
e se teus lábios os vir ao entardecer, à hora mágica, lendo os poemas da galícia — eu regresso — «eu
até nos combóios que cavam um túmulo pelos ares, se te vejo, sulamith — eu «escureço — «e escureço

escurecem as rugas pelos rostos, escurecem os poemas

where you too will come sighing in the ditches, even if yours is a famished voice

as the hair of dark-coloured violins darkens me, as
the wind darkens in the cold woods where we die, the alleys darken

whence you too will appear with the sublime finery of misfortune, even if your blood will curdle
and if in the evening, at the magic hour, i can glimpse your eyes reading galicia’s poems — i will return — «i

"carta ao pai
agora que o senhor
mais assemelha pedaço
de carne com dois olhos
dirigidos ao teto escuro
no leito em que provável
só não há-de morrer só
porque nem a própria
saliva poderá engolir
por si na companhia
somente desta sonda
que o alimenta
me pergunto se ainda
em validade a proibição
da mãe em confessar
ao senhor os hábitos
amorosos das mucosas
que são minhas
e se deveras me amaria
tanto menos soubesse
quanta fricção já tiveram
que não lhes cabia
biológica ou religiosa
-mente e se também
pediria para sua filhoa
a morte que desejou
a tantos de minha laia
quando surgiam na tela
da glboo da record
da manchete do sbt
que sempre constituíram
seu cordão umbilical
com a tradição
e se deveras faria
sobrevir a eles
grande destruição
pela violência
com que urrava
seus xingamentos
típicos de macho
nascido no interior
desse pais de machos
interiores e quebrados
em seus orgulhos falhos
de crer que o pai
é o que abarrota
geladeiras e não deixa
que falte à mesa
o alimento que nutre
as mesmas mucosas
em que corre
o seu sangre
mas não seu deus
e ora neste leito partido
o cérebro em veias
como riachos insistentes
em correr
fora das margens
se o senhor
soubesse o dolo
com que manchei
a mesa
de todos os patriarcas
ainda pergunto-me
se me receberia
com a mansidão
que aceita na testa
o beijo desta sua filhoa
que nada mais é
que a sua imagem
e semelhança invertidas
tal espelho
que refletisse opostos
de gênero e religião
ou o desenho
animado na infância
de uma sala de justiça
onde numa tela
podia-se observar
um mundo ao avesso
e se o pai e o pai
odeiam deveras
o gerado nas normas
da biologia e religião
mais tarde porém geridos
na transgressão das leis
que o pai e o pai
impõem-nos na ciência
de sermos todos falhos
nessa terra onde procriar
é tão frequente
que gere prazer

com essas pupilas
que talvez jamais
reflitam o pai

peço perdão

now that my lord
more closely resembles a hunk
of meat with two eyes
turned toward the dark ceiling
from the gurney where likely
you will not die alone
only because not even able
to swallow your saliva
yourself in the company
of this tube alone
that feeds you
i ask myself
if mother's ban
against confessing
to my lord the amorous habits
of my mucous membranes
is still in place
and if indeed you would love me
the less you knew about
how much rubbing they'd already had
that did not befit them
biological or religious
-ly and also if
you would want for your boyess
the death you wished
on so many of my kind
when they appeared on screen
on globo record
manchete or sbt
which always constituted
your umbilical connection
to tradition
and if indeed you would
make come upon them
great destruction
by the violence
of your raging slurs
typical of a macho man
born in a remote town
in this country of machos
remote and broken
in their false pride
believing that a father
is he who crams
refrigerators full and does
not let the table want for
food to nourish
the same mucous membranes
in which your blood
but not your god
runs thick
and now in this broken gurney
your brain all veins
like rivulets bent on
running
outside the lines
if my lord
knew how
i'd stained the patriarchs'
table with deceit
i still ask myself
if you would welcome
me as meekly
as you accept a kiss
on the forehead from
your boyess
who is nothing more
than your own image
and likeness inverted
a mirror such
as reflects opposites
of gender and religion
or the cartoon
from my childhood
of a hall of justice
where on a screen
you could watch a world gone wrong
and if the father and father
indeed scorn
one created by the norms
of biology and religion
yet later corrected
after flaunting the laws
the father and the father
impose on us in the science
of being all of us flawed
on this earth where procreating
is so common
it brings pleasure
not at all and i look at
my lord
with these pupils
that maybe never
reflect the father

of meat
with two eyes

"a viagem de alexandre à índia
andaste de um ao outro lado da terra na vida interminável,
tiveste degredos, piedosos cíumes, a fé desvanescida,
amantes paradas na lavoura, roubando-te o rosto amado.
viste vestígios de que foste a sombra de ninguém,
olhos sem pudor, do reflexo dos ferros no tropel,
franjas do domínio pueril de alexandre, olhando gaugamela.
partiste num porto de transição para o levante,
com vazios para trás, todo o tempo a poder ver,
e ao primeiro inverno, pelos cardeais das suas cinzas,
começaste a travessia que não termina, a história que não acaba.
soubeste porque se vislumbra, em lágrimas, o pinheiro da juventude,
o nome quebrado num turvo ar medido sem corda,
e a maresia do vento de feição no segundo inverno.
em troca perseguiste o que rege o homem fortuito,
segredando em palácios de mármore que são apenas pedras,
dos fracassos a que jamais alguém ajoelhara.
ao terceiro inverno descobriste o hemisfério, e ao quarto,
sem ideia de guerra ou ordem para mudar o reino,
escolheste adornar os aquedutos sob o manto dos regatos,
sentado, na brisa no tanque, ao febril entardecer.
de quem te aproximaste, no seu trajecto interminado,
sem lugar senão o que esfria na mente recortada,
naquilo que se ramifica, tornando-se na própria teia,
contigo propagou o dever de passar em toda a parte.
e quando veio o quinto inverno, e o sexto, suturaste o sangue,
trouxeste a pele à curva dos rios, acolheste o que de resto se desmorona,
e pudeste enfim, na crença dos migradores furtivos, entender que
tudo se perde noutro lugar ainda, e após esse ainda noutro
e que ao fim de cada manhã noutra manhã
tudo é incerto, tão conforme o dente-de-leão no meio de searas,
tão emudecido como a veia exausta dos não sepultados.
na mansarda onde vagueia o dia e a noite
o vento responde, cortando o centeio e o calcário, e a vela
que brilha na luz de estrelas veladas, já desaparecidas,
pisadas, mudas, engolidas aos pés do sétimo inverno,
arpoa o coração e a ruína — os meridianos despem-se, voam
em vinte e cinco anos que há pouco se beijavam, e seja dito ou não dito
o prazer que inflige um pico de tormentos
por lábios que só as mulheres conhecem
no moinho das águas da morte em varanasi,
sacode a chama de quanto vale, dura e canta
o princípio e o fim do teu poder na terra.","alexandres`s travel to india
you wandered an interminable life across the earth,
suffered exile, piteous jealousy, futile faith,
labour-arrested lovers plundering your beloved’s face.
you saw traces of having been no one’s shadow,
impudent eyes, the reflection of iron on the rampage,
hints of alexander’s puerile dominance, contemplating gaugamela.
you set off from a transient port towards the levant,
leaving emptiness behind, seeing all of time,
and in the first winter, by the cardinals of its ashes,
you started the endless crossing, the incessant history.
you knew, because the pine tree of youth can be glimpsed through tears,
of the shattered name in a cloudy mood measured without ropes,
and of the favourable sea breeze in the second winter.
in exchange you pursued that which rules the fortuitous man,
whispering in marble palaces that are but stones,
failures to which no one had ever knelt.
by the third winter you discovered the hemisphere, and by the fourth,
non intent on war or order to change the kingdom,
you chose to adorn aqueducts with the mantle of streams,
sitting by the pool breeze, in the evening´s lingering fever.
whomever you approached, in their indefinite path,
without a place except that which fades inside a patchy mind,
in that which branches out and becomes the very web,
has spread with you the duty to pass through everywhere.
and by the fifth winter, and the sixth, you stitched up the blood,
brought the skin on to the river bends, welcomed that which falls apart,
and were at last capable, with the belief of a stealthy migrant, of understanding
that all is lost yet in another place, and after this in yet another
and that by the end of each morning in another morning
all is uncertain, just like a dandelion in a field of wheat,
as muted as the exhausted vein of the unburied.
in the attic where night and day roam
the wind replies, cutting the chalk and the rye, and the candle,
shimmering in the light of the veiled stars already gone,
trodden, voiceless, swallowed up by the seventh winter,
spears the heart and the ruin — the meridians undress, fly away
in twenty five years that were just kissing yesterday, and be it told or untold
the pleasure that brings a peak of torment, inflicted
by lips that only women know
in the turmoil of varanasi´s death waters,

"da menina e moça
pensando-vos estou filha
vossa mãe me está lembrando
enchem-se-me os olhos d’água
nela vos estou lavando:
nascestes filha antre mágoa
para bem filha vos seja
que no vosso nascimento
vos ouve a fortuna inveja:
morto era o contentamento
nenhuma alegria ouvistes,
vossa mãe era finada,
nos outras éamos tristes:
nada em dor em dor crescida
não sei onde isto há de ir ter
vejo-vos filha fermosa
cos olhos verdes crescer:
não era esta graça vossa
para nascer em desterro
mal haja a desaventura
que pôs mais nisto que o erro:
tinha aqui sua sepultura
vossa mãe e mágoa a nós
não éreis vos filha não
para morrerem por vós:
não houve em fados razão
nem se consente rogar
de vosso pai hei mor dó
que de si s’á de queixar:
eu vos ouvi a vós só
primeiro que outrem ninguém
não fôreis vós seu não fora
não sei se fiz mal se bem:
mas não pode ser senhora
para mal nenhum nascerdes
com este riso gracioso
que tendes sobr’olhos verdes:
conforto mais duvidoso
me é este que tomo assi
deus voos dê milhor ventura
da que tevestes té ‘qui:
que a dita e a fermosura
dizem patranhas antigas
que pelejaram um dia
sendo dantes muito amigas:
muitos hão que é fantasia
eu que vi tempos e anos
nenhuma cousa duvido
como ela é caso de danos:
mas nenhum mal nom é crido
o bem só é esperado
e na crença e na esperança
em ambas há i mudança
em ambas há i cuidado","from menina e moça
i’m thinking of you, dear girl,
your mother’s memory haunts me.
my eyes fill up with tears,
they are bathing you gently.
you were born amid sorrow—
may it yet prove a blessing.
since fortune, struck with envy,
singled you out at birth.
gone forever was contentment,
you heard no joyful voices.
your mother’s life had ended,
while ours went on in sadness.
in anguish born and raised!
i don’t know where all this is going.
i’ve watched you grow, my girl,
with green eyes so lovely.
beauty like yours wasn’t meant
to be born in exile. curses on
fate! this was clearly a work
of malevolence, not a mistake.
here lies your mother,
and we languish in grief.
you did nothing, my girl,
to incur a loss so great.
the fates spurn reason,
and will admit no protest.
i pity your poor father,
for the pain he must lament.
i heard you crying, alone,
before anyone else. you’d not
be here, had i not been there.
still, i ask if i did right.
but surely it can’t be wrong
for you to have been born
with that elegant smile of yours,
those dazzling green eyes.
it’s an unlikely comfort
that i take for myself.
may god grant you the grace
that has eluded you till now.
beauty and good fortune,
or so the old story goes,
were once the best of friends,
but became bitterly opposed.
many hold that it’s fantasy,
but in my life i’ve seen
enough not to doubt it:
fate inflicts great damage.
no harm is ever believed;
we always expect the good.

does one survive

in death, replied: yes,
one does survive, one crosses the burning

singed, muslin stuck to skin,

not only learned the alphabet,
but also the psiomeg

of loss accruing like debt.
these, these ought to console:
persephone’s spring returns
from vacation in the underworld, and fish
return to devastated rivers, and whales
to oceans of plastic, and even the arctic
sun returns after months and months
of night.

the most freakish of allegories have
been used for this stubbornness.
the maddest of joys.
almodóvar and the coma among the bulls,
duras and the buds in hiroshima soil.

returns. the holothurian, the gecko’s tail,
the arm of the starfish, and on and on...

quando as fomes grandes foram
que alentejo foi perdido

foi este pastor fogido:
levava um pouco de gado
que lhe ficou de outro muito
que lhe morreu de cansado
que alentejo era enxuto

toda a terra foi perdida
no campo do tejo só
achava o gado guarida
ver alentejo era um dó:
e jano, pera salvar
o gado que lhe ficou,
foi esta terra buscar,
e um cuidado levou,
outro foi ele lá achar
o dia que ali chegou
com seu gado e com seu fato
com tudo se agasalhou
em uma bicada de um mato:
e levando-o a pascer
o outro dia à ribeira
joana acertou de ir ver,
que andava pela ribeira
do tejo: a flores colher
vestido branco trazia
um pouco afrontada andava
fermosa bem parecia
aos olhos de quem na olhava:
jano em vendo-a foi pasmado
mas por ver que ela fazia
escondeu-se antre um prado:
joana flores colhia
jano colhia cuidado
despois que ela teve as flores
já colhidas e escolhidas,
as desvariadas cores
com rosas entremetidas:
fez delas uma capela
e soltou os seus cabelos
que eram tão longos como ela
e de cada um a jano em vê-los
lhe nascia uma querela
e em quanto aquisto fazia
joana: o seu gado andava
por dentro da água fria
todo após quem o guiava:
dum pato grande era guia
e todo junto em carreira
ora rio acima ia,
ora, na mesma maneira
o rio abaixo descia
joana como assentou
a capela: foi com a mão
à cabeça, e atentou
se estava em boa feição:
não ficando satisfeita
do que da mão presumia
partiu-se dali direita
para onde o rio fazia
d’água: uma mansa, colheita
chegando à beira do rio,
as patas logo vieram
todas uma e uma, em fio,
que toda a água moveram:
de quanto ela já folgou
com aquestes gasalhados
tanto entonces lhe pesou
e com pedras e com brados
d’ali longe as enxotou
depois que elas foram idas
e que a água assossegou
joana as abas erguidas
entrar pel’água ordenou,
e assentando-se então
as çapatas descalçou
e pondo-as sobre o chão
por dentro d’água entrou
e a jano polo coração
em quanto com passos quedos
joana pela água ia
antre uns desejos e medos
jano onde estava ardia:
não sabia se falasse
se saísse, se estivesse
que o amor mandava que ousasse
e por que a não perdesse
fazia que arreceasse
dizem que naqueste meo
se esteve joana olhando
e descobrindo o seu seo
olhou-se, e dixe um ai dando:
eu guardo patas coitada
não sei onde isto há de ir ter
mais era eu pera guardada
que concerto foi este ser
fermosa, e mal empregada
em aquisto jano ouvindo
não se pôde em si sofrer
que d’antre as ervas saindo
se não lançasse a correr:
joana quando sentiu
os estrompidos de jano
e que se virou e o viu
temor do presente dano
lhe deu pés com que fugiu
mui perto estava o casal
onde vivia o pai dela
que fez ir mais longe o mal
que jano teve de vê-la:
mas o medo que causou
joana partir-se assi
tanto as mãos lhe embaraçou
que a çapata esquerda ali
com a pressa lhe ficou
jano quando viu, e olhou
que nenhum remédio havia
pera o lugar se tornou
aonde ela n’água se via:
e vendo a çapata estar
no areal, à beira d’água
foi correndo a abraçar
tomando-a cresceu-lhe a mágoa
e começou de chorar
toda a çapata e os peitos
em lagrimas se banharam
muitos foram os respeitos
que tanto choro causaram:
encostado ao seu cajado
a çapata na outra mão
despois de um longo cuidado
de dentro do coração
começou falar cansado
jano
despojo da mais fermosa
cousa, que viram meus olhos
pera eles sois uma rosa
e pera o coração abrolhos:
çapata deixada aqui
pera mal de outro mor mal
quem te leixou, leva a mi,:
que troca tão desigual
mais pois assi é seja assim
agora hei vinte e um anos
e nunca inda ‘té agora
me acorda de sentir danos
os deste meu gado em fora:
e hoje per caso estranho
não sei em que hora aqui vim
cobrei cuidado tamanho,
que aos outros todos pôs fim
eu mesmo a mim mesmo estranho
antes que este mal viesse
que me tantos vai mostrando
que alguns cuidados tivesse
não me matavam cuidando,
agora por meus pecados
e segundo em mi vou vendo
não podem ser outros fados
meus cuidados não entendo
e moiro-me assi de cuidados
dentro de meu pensamento
há tanta contrariedade
que sento contra o que sento
vontade, e contra vontade:
estou em tanto desvairo,
que não me entendo comigo
donde esperarei repairo
que vejo grande o perigo
e muito mor o contrario
quem me trouxe a esta terra
alhea, onde guardada
me estava tamanha guerra
e a esperança levada:
comigo me estou espantado
como em tão pouco me dei
mas cuidando nisto estando,
os olhos com que outrem olhei
de mim, se estavam vingando
e por meu mal ser mor: inda
de mim tenho o agravo mor
que da minha mágoa infinda
eu fui parte e causador,
que se me não alevantara
d’antre as ervas onde estava
mais dos meus olhos gozara
e já que assi se ordenava
isto ao menos me ficara
desastres cuidava eu já,
quando eu ontem aqui cheguei
que a vós e á ventura má,
ambos acabava e errei:
triste que me parecia
que o meu gado remediado
comigo bem me haveria
e estava-me ordenado
est’outro mal que inda havia
o mal, não vos sabe a vós
quem me vos a mim causou
tristes dos meus olhos sós
que trouveram aonde estou:
olhos: acerto, lugar
ribeira mor das ribeiras
que levam as águas ao mar
vós me sereis verdadeiras

autor
e em dizendo isto parece
trasportou-se no seu mal
e como a quem o ar falece
caiu naquele areal:
grande espaço se passou
que esteve ali sem sentido
e neste meo chegou
um pastor seu conhecido
e que dormia cuidou
franco de sandovir era
o seu nome, e buscava
uma frauta que perdera
que ele mais que a si amava:
este era aquele pastor
a quem celia muito amou
ninfa do maior primor
que em mondego se banhou
e que cantava milhor
e a frauta sua era aquela
que lhe celia dera, quando
o desterraram por ela,
chorando ele, ela chorando:
viera ele ali mora
porque achou aquelas terras
mais conformes ao cuidar
d’ambas partes cercam serras,
no meu campos para olhar
doutro tempo conhecidos
estes dous pastores eram
d’estranhas terras nascidos,
não no bem que se quiseram;
e por aquesta razão
tornou franco a lhe notar
como jazia no chão
e deu-lhe que suspeitar
o lugar e a feição
muito esteve duvidando
o que aqui franco faria
indo-se e jano deixando
o coração lhe doía:
também pera o acordar
não sabia se acertava
que jano era no lugar
novo, e arreceava
em cabo de o anojar
naquesta dúvida estando
jano estava emborcado
dixe um suspiro dando
ai cuidado, e mais cuidado:
ouvindo-lhe isto dizer
franco se ficou pasmado
e tornando-o milhor ver
de sob seu esquerdo lado
viu-lh’a çapata ter
suspeitou logo o que era,
(que era também namorado)
e no que jano dixera
se houve por certificado
naquisto jano acordou
quando viu franco estar
sem fala um pouco ficou
franco, após o saudar
falar-lhe assi começou
franco cuidava eu agora jano
que estavas em outra parte
e polo teu, aqueste ano
me pesava ir por esta arte:
dessejava ver-te aqui
quando me contava alguém
a seca grande que hai
em alentejo, e porém
não quisera eu ver-te assi
conta-me que mal foi este
que tão demudado estás
ou que houveste ou perdeste
se há remédio havê-lo-ás:
faz jano então por se erguer
não podendo de cansado
foi-lhe a mão, franco, estender
e a um freixo encostado
lhe começou responder
jano
vim a estes campos que vejo
por dar vida a este meu gado
vi acabado um desejo,
outro maior começado:
às minhas vacas dei vida
e a mim a fui tirar
a profecia é cumprida
que me pierio foi dar
vendo-me a barba pungida
autor
de pierio vai grã fama
(dixe franco) antre os pastores
todos por amigos chama
e dizem que é dado a amores,
rogo-te jano me digas
pois te ele avisou primeiro
como cobraste fadigas
que ouço que é mui verdadeiro
pera amigos e amigas
jano
tão cansado, respondeu
de um cuidado, franco, me acho
que m’agora aqui nasceu
que até na voz tenho empacho,
aos que hão de aquecer
não pode homem resistir
que o há de ser, há de ser
não se lhe pode fugir,
defender, nem esconder
mas por que franco, contigo
desabafo eu em falar
por que sei que és meu amigo
tudo te quero contar:
nem remédio nem conforto
não te hei franco de pedir
que do mal em que estou posto
não me espero de remir
senão despois que for morto
dia era de um grão vodo
que a um santo se fazia
onde ia o povo todo
por ver e por romaria,
lembra-me que andava eu então
vestido todo de novo
ao ombro um chapeirão
que pasmava todo o povo
com um cajado na mão
tomando-me pelo braço
pierio, então me levou
d’ali um grande pedaço
onde milhor sombra achou:
e mandando-me assentar
ele também se assentou
e antes de começar
pera mim um pouco olhou
e a voltas de chorar
pierio
vejo-te (me dixe) jano,
dos bens do mundo abastado
mas contando ano e ano
fico de todo cortado:
vejo-te lá pela idade
de nuve negra cercado
vejo-te sem liberdade
de tua terra desterrado
e mais de tua vontade
em terra que inda não viste,
pelo que nela hás de ver,
vejo-te o coração triste
pera em dias que viver,
hás de morrer de uma dor
de que agora andas bem fora
por isso vive em temor
que não sabe homem aquela hora
em que lhe há de vir o amor
não pode já longe vir
jano aquisto que te digo
vejo-te a barba pungir
olha como andas contigo:
à terra estranha irás
por teu gado não perderes
longos males passarás
por uns mui breves prazeres
que verás ou não verás
(e dando um pouco á cabeça,
á maneira d’anojado)
por teu bem porém te cresça
a barba (dixe) de honrado:
treslada-o no coração
isto que te aqui direi
que ainda que te aqui direi
que ainda alguns tempos virão
jano, que te alembrarei
mande deus que seja em vão
por cobrares a fazenda
a ti mesmo perderás
perda que não tem emenda
despois quando o saberás:
nos campos de uma ribeira
onde vales há a lugares
te está guardada a primeira
causa destes teus pesares
noutra parte a derradeira
jeitos em cousas pequenas
louros cabelos ondados
porão pera sempre em penas
a ti e a teus cuidados:
falas cheas de desdém
de presunção cheas delas
cousas que outras cousas têm
te causarão as querelas
de que morrer te convém
de todo o que te hei contado

between the rivers tagus
and guadiana, there lived,
it’s said, a shepherd lost
in love for one joana.
the maiden kept ducks
along the tagus’s banks,
her father’s house nearby.
the shepherd’s name was jano,
he hailed from alentejo.
when famine swept the land,
laying it all to waste,
the shepherd, seeking refuge,
fled torrão, his village.
he took with him the remnants
of his once-great flock,
the rest dead of exhaustion.
the drought-struck alentejo
was rather poor in pasture.
everywhere was the piteous
sight of barren fields!
only in the tagus’s
meadows could his flock
find relief. and so jano,
to save his dwindling herd,
set out for land to graze on.
the heart he held was troubled,
and trouble was waiting ahead.
the day that he arrived
with goats and sheep in tow,
he pitched camp at the edge
of a wood. the next morning,
while taking his flock to feed
along the river’s margins,
he laid eyes on joana,
out picking the flowers
that lined the tagus’s banks.
the dress she wore was white,
her cheeks were lightly flushed,
to jano, his eyes agog,
she looked fair and lovely.
though smitten at first sight,
he crouched behind the reeds,
admiring her from a distance.
joana gathered flowers,
in jano passion gathered.
after she had collected
her flowers and selected
the various shades, weaving
the blossoms together with roses,
she made a garland, and let
her hair fall: those tresses
were as long as she was tall.
every lock of her hair
was awakening jano’s desire.
as joana tidied her hair,
her flock of hens waddled
into the cool water,
guided by a huge mallard.
they swam, now upriver,
all in one direction,
now swiftly swam downstream,
together in single file.
joana placed the garland
on her head, stroking it
with her hands to see if
all sat perfectly in place.
not quite satisfied
with what her fingers revealed,
straight away she went
to where the river formed
a cove of placid water.
no sooner had she reached
the bank than her ducks came
flocking towards her, one after
the other, splashing wildly.
initially she’d delighted
in these shows of affection,
quickly her heart grew heavy.
flinging rocks and jeers,
she shooed the ducks away.
once they were all gone,
and the water calm again,
joana tucked her skirt up,
preparing for a swim.
she sat upon the bank,
carefully removing her slippers,
placing each on the ground.
then into the water she went,
and deep into jano’s heart.
as joana took delicate
steps into the river,
jano kept utterly still,
ablaze with desire and fear.
whether to speak, run,
stay put — he didn’t know.
love demanded boldness,
and yet the very thought of
losing her stirred up dread.
all this time joana
stood gazing at her reflection.
staring at her bosom,
she gave a sigh and said:
“what torment! a keeper
of ducks, i should be kept.
where is my life going?
what cruel sense of harmony:
to be fair and drudging away!
hearing these words jano
couldn’t contain himself.
having no other choice,
he burst out the grassy bank.
joana, feeling the thunderous
crash of jano’s footsteps,
turned and saw his face.
sensing the danger at hand,
she swiftly ran toward home.
the house where her father lived
was near, which plunged jano
further into the despair
born of their encounter.
the same fear that had urged
joana’s feet forward
also completely seized
her hands — and in her haste
she grabbed only one slipper.
looking around jano
saw there was no remedy,
turning his gaze to where
joana had studied her image.
when he spotted her slipper
on top the pebbly shore,
he raced over to retrieve it.
squeezing it in his arms,
he felt his sorrow grow,
and began to weep, bathing
his chest and the slipper in tears.
many were the reasons
for his anguished weeping.
leaning against his staff,
holding the slipper tightly,
jano paused for a moment
then he spoke from the heart,
exhausted and teary-eyed.
jano
“o remnant of the fairest
thing that i’ve ever seen,
to my eyes you are a rose,
and to my heart, thistles.
slipper cruelly forgotten,
remembering cruel passion,
who left you sweeps me away—
what an unfair exchange!
alas, that’s the way it must be.
“in my twenty-one years
i can’t remember feeling
even a pang of sorrow,
my flock’s troubles aside.
today, by some strange fate,
— i don’t know when exactly—,
i was racked by a yearning
that eclipsed my other cares,
becoming estranged myself.
“before this present sorrow,
which only multiplies,
although i had my cares,
the caring didn’t kill me.
but now it’s far too late,
i sense the change within,
my fate’s already sealed.
i do not grasp my anguish,
and languish of this passion.
“all i think is riddled
with glaring contradictions:
i oppose what i desire,
while desiring the opposite.
what i feel is so muddled,
i’m at odds with myself.
where might i look for relief?
i know the danger is grave—
graver is my confusion.
“who brought me to this strange
land, where an all-out war
awaited me and where i had
my hope taken away?
i scarcely can believe it:
here i am, reduced
to tears, passion’s slave.
the eyes with which i glimpsed
my beloved are taking revenge.
“my sorrow is greater still:
i brought this all on myself,
culprit and victim of infinite
suffering. had i only
stayed hidden in the reeds,
i would have feasted my eyes
on her beauty, and then —
since it has to be this way —,
at least i’d have my memory.
“disaster upon disaster!
yesterday i came here,
thinking my troubles gone.
oh how i was mistaken!
though i’d begun to hope
that, with my flock restored,
some good might come my way,
sadly, fortune willed
that i should suffer on.
“accursed love! who made me
love's prisoner knows none.
my sad, lonely eyes,
having met her gaze
on the banks of this river
that stretches unto infinity,
carrying water to sea:
you’ll be the faithful witnesses
to all my weighty sorrows.
author
having said these words,
transported by his passion,
jano fell on the sand,
like a man starved of air.
after some time had gone by,
jano still lying senseless,
a shepherd he used to know
passed by, noting the man
fast asleep on the ground.
franco of sandovir
was his name—searching
for a flute he had lost
but loved better than life,
this shepherd was adored
by none less than celia,
that finest of nymphs who bathed
in the mondego’s waters,
hers the sweetest of voices.
she gave the flute to franco
when he was leaving for exile
—imposed on him for his love—,
he weeping as she wept.
he had come here to live,
finding the landscape appropriate
for his aching heart:
rugged hills on all sides,
open fields to gaze on.
born to very little
in villages far apart,
these two shepherds had been
friends in bygone days.
for this reason franco
turned to take another
look at the man lying
on the ground, sensing
that something was amiss.
franco struggled greatly
deciding what to do—
were he to leave jano
behind, his heart would ache.
nor did he think it wise
to rouse his friend awake.
with jano being asleep
in an unfamiliar place,
he feared that he might startle.
franco wrestling with doubt,
jano turned on his back.
heaving a sigh, he said,
“all i do is suffer!”
when he heard these words,
franco turned around
in astonishment, noticing
the slipper tucked gingerly
beneath jano’s left arm.
he suspected what it was,
for he too was in love.
in jano’s bitter words
he’d all the proof he needed.
jano, now fully alert,
realizing it was franco,
stared in bewildered silence.
franco greeted him warmly
and with these words began:
franco
“why jano, i had thought
you lived in other parts.
i feared, for you and your flock,
the year might go this way.
when i caught word of the drought
now sweeping alentejo,
i hoped i’d see you here,
though certainly not in this state.
“tell me what harm’s been done
that you should be so changed?
what trouble found? thing lost?
if there’s a cure, you’ll have it.”
when jano, still quite weak,
tried to get up but stumbled,
franco held out his hand.
leaning against the trunk
of an ash tree jano said:
jano
“i came to the fields before me
to give life to my flock.
i slaked one desire only
to know greater thirst.
to my cattle i gave life,
having taken my own!
the prophecy’s been fulfilled,
as revealed by pierio,
when my first beard came in.
author
“among shepherds,” said franco,
“his reputation precedes him.
he considers all his friends;
he’s given, they say, to affairs.
now, jano, tell me this,
if he warned you in advance,
why this present hardship?
i hear he’s an honest friend
to men and women both.”
jano
“franco, i’ve grown so weary,
of the sorrow i’ve found
since coming to this place,
i can feel the strain in my voice.
whatever fortune brings,
a man can’t resist his fate,
what will be, will be—
there’s no escaping it, no point
fighting it, no hiding away.
“but with you, dear franco,
i can freely vent my pain.
knowing you to be a friend,
i wish to tell you everything.
i don’t ask that you provide
comfort or remedy, franco.
fr i can’t hope to be saved
from the trouble i’m in,
at least not till i die.
“it was a saint’s day feast:
all the people huddled
together, pilgrims come
from far and wide to see.
that day i remember dressing
in all new clothes, draped on
my shoulder was a woolen
hood coveted by the crowd.
in my hand i held my staff.
“taking me by the arm,
pierio led me some distance,
to a well-shaded grove.
telling me to take a seat
and sitting down next to me,
he paused and stared a while,
not saying a word, looking
on the verge of tears.
pierio
“jano,” he said, “i see
you don’t lack for worldly goods.
but with each passing year
my outlook grows more grim.
i see a black cloud looming.
now that you’re of age,
i see you stripped of freedom,
in exile far from home,
still farther from your will.
“in a land you’ve yet to see,
you’ll catch sight of something
that fills your heart with sorrow
for the rest of your days.
you’ll die of an affliction
that’s now just a distant threat.
live, therefore, in fear,
for no man knows the hour
when love will choose to strike.
“jano, the things i’ve said
can’t be very far away:
i see the down on your lip;
look at how you’re acting.
you’ll travel to a strange land
so as not to lose your flock,
enduring bitter hardships
for the briefest of pleasures,
so you’ll see, should you choose.”
pierio shook his head,
a stern look on his face.
“now, for your own sake,
act with manly honor,
and etch onto your heart
the words i’m about to say.
some hard days lie ahead,
jano, i must remind you.
may god prove me wrong!”
“in trying to save your flock,
you’ll become lost to yourself—
a loss that’s beyond repair
by the time it registers.
in the fields by the river,
among valleys, there lurks
your suffering’s first cause.
elsewhere you’ll meet your demise:
“her dainty mannerisms,
her wavy blonde hair
will subject your heart and mind
to never-ending punishment.
words laced with disdain,
words uttered in scorn,
a vast array of injuries —
it’ll all make you complain
so bitterly, you’d rather die.”
jano
“nearly all that i’ve said
happened as predicted.
what’s not yet come to pass,
the past has set in motion.
just a short while ago,
i caught sight of a lady
my eyes keep searching for.
my life and soul, she’s gone,
having deemed me unworthy.”
author
while jano spoke, a bloodhound
belonging to franco found
the missing flute, clutching it
with its teeth. when he saw,
bursting with joy, franco
ran to retrieve the flute.
standing on its hind legs,
the dog placed it in his hands,
proceeding to roll on its back.
franco turned to jano,
then he said these words:
“when he sees what he’s pined for,
a man forgets all else.
i cut your story short—
for that you’ll have to blame
whom i can’t, or forgive me
yourself, jano. you know
what it means to be in love.”
“that flute must be dear to you
as few things are,” said jano.
“indeed, nothing’s dearer,”
franco said in response.
“whoever gave you that
must have you in her debt,”
jano said to franco,
“truly you must play well ,
unless the dog got it wrong.”
“sing something, franco,
sadness loves a song!
let us see if your music
can’t soothe my bitter sorrow.”
“of course,” franco said,
“i will sing for you, jano,
as one sings for an ailing man.
although truth be told,
my song is but a wail.”
“i would like for you to hear
the song i sang last night,
after i had lost my flute,
left with only my voice.
when at last i went to bed,
i wasn’t tired of searching,
but weary of finding nothing.
now, jano, i mean it,
i couldn’t shut my eyes.”
“there, in the deep of night,
when all was utterly still,
i belted out my song,
an owl kept me company.
from his faraway perch,
—perhaps i only imagined it—
the owl would respond with sighs
as heavy as my own.
at any rate, here goes.”
song
wandering in exile i ask:
what to do, where to go?
after the deepest despair,
i’ve found the greatest sorrow.
the anguish! i’m a roving
stranger in remote lands,
to which i came in search
of refuge for my flock!
i, to whom cruel fortune
affords no consolation,
fear that, being ill-fated,
i will one day be made
to die by my own hand.
how to explain myself
to one not here to ask me?
how to beg forgiveness
of one who cannot hear me?
o gift of my beloved,
whose absence shrouds the night,
my flute, lost forever!
make a grave and bury me:
i perished long ago…
and upon my tombstone,
let these words be written:
in her heart lies my soul.
if on a distant day
in years to come, celia,
wherever she may be,
having heard the smallest
portion of all i suffered,
were to fall to pieces,
unable to hold back tears—
then would my soul be sated,
or whatever remains of me.
though i ask for nothing,
since i suffer so greatly,
let my eyes drift in reverie.
day after day slips by.
these lonely nights were made
for anguished spirits like ours.
“that’s the song, dear jano,
i believed it was my last;
i confess i hoped it’d mark
the end of all my suffering.
if mind and soul don’t perish
with the body, my sorrow
will remain. let us go,
it’s time the flock grazed,
torment too has its season.”",pt_XX,en_XX,"Two seconds .

in a small café on a long street with legs in the sea
and dom rodrigos bunched in lustrous wrappers on the table, no
it must have been only when we stretched out our hands they slid
and we bumped our chests together clanking you laughed i
made a fool of myself, maybe it was there because we wrote about it
each one understanding in his own way just as it’s always
been, though i warned you at once that i had no hope
we’d ever coincide you thought sure excellent because
that way we’d constantly want to probe each other
always pinching ourselves to see where it touched
there in the depths where it hurt not to fit perfectly
together, only that yes it’s a privilege it happens fewer
times than we have fingers finding
someone who we want to keep beating as
you said you would do to me for a lifetime when you squeezed
the resistance of material below my arms, and it must have
been delicacy not to justify yourself despite the pride
of performing feats we never count the beginnings or the ends
so i’m waiting for you to show up behind an sms with an apple
pie hoisted to your muzzle, that the game of making all those
important gestures in the doorway doesn’t exhaust you so later
you freshen up like it was nothing and flee because your handicap
is smaller and your paws are bigger and you want to see other beasts full
of questions, if it was me i’d put on my spanish dress and we’d whirl

“eu cá também não gosto, há mais coisas
além deste desconchavo”, dizia marianne
moore da poesia. de resto, conseguia
ver mitocôndrias e as demais
pequenas vidas – olho fixo
na miúda mancha de aguarela
comprimida entre vidros de lamela
redonda a pupila em maravilha
prévia ao mistério: saber o que era.
mais importa observar ou designar?
eu erro no olhar receio às vezes
esqueço a árvore onde deixei as chaves
e o caderno, depois não sei chamar
o quê, espécie ou parentesco, ache embora
sossego na língua arcana dos plátanos
atrás das placas do jardim botânico.
portanto sirvo mal, sou outra, fora
do baralho, turista aqui em tanto

‘i, too, dislike it: there are things that are important
beyond all this fiddle,’ marianne moore said about
poetry. in any case, she was able
to see mitochondria and all the other
tiny lives – eye fixed
on the minute blotch of watercolor
compressed between two glass slides
the pupil round with wonder
just before mystery: to know what it was.
is it more important to observe or to designate?
i fear sometimes i look askew
forget the tree where i left my keys
and my notebook, then i don’t know what to call
what, kind or relation, though i find
tranquility in the arcane language of the plane trees
behind the plaques in the botanical garden.
so i serve badly, i’m other, the odd one
out, a tourist here in so much
that pleases me and is work.

on my small scale in this myself

sweet the alp in the angle of her jaw

dilutes sleep
the mules feed off the fleeting

luminously
glued to keeping quiet
to moving

a range on the horizon
a less uncrossable elevation
than the lowlands of lived life

fingered between thighs
stir the last pleasure out of the little
campfire that crackled

munch a bit of flour
shredded bits of jerky
swigs of steaming coffee

whose boots don’t weigh a thing

will remain for a while marking the plot of grass
stones ringing what had been
a scintillating flame later gone dark
now pasture to the scent of the timid
animals that will wander in
sounding out this sullied bit of the scene
at this very moment our scent
sails through narrow ravines
mixed with the dust and the clamor of hoofs that brings us
straying close on the edge of precipices
our own echoing
will embarrass us
but within – more silence even than the gorse

é-me indiferente: poeta, poetisa
dependerá do ritmo ou da medida –
prefiro tradutora, mas admito
que por vezes não dobro e sou narcisa.
2.
a minha primeira poesia era
sobre chuva e choro. hoje seria
prosa, ou sobre chuva e a pólvora:
chove fora viola o vento o vidro,
a rua nunca é como os prospectos –
o meu bilhete ao mundo, espeto-o
com delicado verbo ao coração.
rebenta, murcho músculo entupido –
mil vezes fosse a vida a excepção.
3.
se o rigor do verso não visa qualquer prova
senão procura –
ou provar o que seja de sabor.
se não escrevo por encomenda
senão por ventura serôdia

posso posar, certamente,
para a máquina fotográfica,
moldar a boca ao disparo ou regular
a abertura ao diafragma. dependente
do papel revelador –
modelo artista presa, sou como todos:
as vidas que não toco interessam-me
num desequilíbrio de voracidade e avareza.
antes ainda assim me conheçam de vista
que de revista.","introductory text

for me it makes little difference: poet, poetess –
depends on the measure, and the stress –
i prefer translator, but admit
that i sometimes can’t be plied, i’m a narcissist.

my earliest poetry was about rain
and weeping. today it would be
prose and rain, or gunpowder:

mas a região mais central do nada, o pátio
furioso da potência

sobraram do estampido inaugural desse dia inicial inteiro

but the central region of nihility, the furious
patio of power

left over from the inaugural detonation of this first clean
whole day that climaxed in the minus-one ground of this brief logarithmic
text, purposeless and without any application

to voice what leans into the infinite
to secretly observe the access each thing allows through the fissure of miracle
and which goes by the name of chance, or accident

plunged in night that divides and fraternally shares two
scraps of the same idea:
round flattened at the poles insecure in its fall
out of darkness
the pendular head sunk between shoulders
shadows
the orbit of the absurd fulfilling its incumbent curvature
wandering distorting the silent
clarity of hemispheres
festooned in eyes of beryl, orifices, surrounded
by visibilities
panoramas breaking off that linger
long afterwards, coiling
a game of veiling and unveiling on the rooftop terrace
of events
where a tongue licks particles, proffers phrases
or the muteness of fireflies

out from the center, it’s thwarted
and everything crashes, velocious
mobile rewinding, an utter retroversion, and we can see

pass through the eye of a needle

resplendence really as though a flame were handed to us
to fill the darkness

burning the weeds
burying the signs
tipping the sphere of thinking into the water

ever dimmer
inundated, sleep is submerged under nocturnal weight
the body shudders with anonymity
it’s in the calm of a room humming with death
that our sphere falls into its crowd of ghosts
the ceiling opens on the celestial fire
on a different, a singular clarity
and in this emptiness, this opening, in this
high burgeoning snowflake a magnolia blooms and blooms
the immense sequoia of the world retires
to its dominion
while dimensions of fear and crap cool in their own venue
the naked bulb in the middle of the ceiling
the orphan waves of the circuit breaker are hushed
in hidden complexities

"a europa em roterdão
dói-me o coração da europa, com as suas veias inchadas
pelo vento do ocidente, e as mãos gretadas pelo gelo
dos invernos. sentei-me com a europa num bar de roterdão,
desenhando na cabeça os mapas do mundo; e obriguei-a
a beber o café holandês, com os seus lábios doentes,
como se a europa não fosse o continente insone
dos últimos milénios, varrido pelos temporais da
mitologia, de crença abalada por um terror ateu.
vi a europa nesse café de roterdão, antes de sair
para as ruas desenhadas a compasso e esquadro;
perguntei-lhe para onde queria ir; e ouvi o seu
murmúrio despir-se de uma palidez plural, como
se ela quisesse ser o rosto único da multidão,
e passear num anonimato de rua cosmopolita,
ouvindo as vozes que lhe falam de ilhas e praias,
restituindo-lhe um sonho de antigas viagens.
vejo nos seus olhos um reflexo das gruas e
guindastes do porto de roterdão, e apago-o com
a borracha da eternidade, para que ela se sente
na esplanada onde lhe peço que me fale; e
ela olha-me, em silêncio, com a voz alucinada
num eco de loucura; e ouço-a dizer-me que
não sabe em que tempo vive, como se fosse
eu que lhe tivesse de ensinar o caminho.
pego na sua mão; e ela desfaz-se nas linhas
improváveis do poema, onde se projecta uma
sombra que eu perco, na noite de roterdão.","europe in rotterdam
the heart of europe is hurting me, with its veins swollen
by the wind out of the west, and its hands cracked by the ice
of winters. i sat down with europe in a rotterdam bar,
drawing the maps of the world in my mind; i made her
drink a dutch coffee, with her sick lips,
as though europe were not the insomniac continent
of the latest millennia, swept by the storms of
mythology, belief shaken by an atheist terror.
i saw europe in that café in rotterdam, before going out
into the streets drawn by compass and set square;
i asked her where she would like to go; and heard her
murmur slip out of her plural paleness, as though
she’d wanted to be the crowd’s single face,
and walk anonymously down the cosmopolitan street,
hearing the voices which speak of to her of islands and beaches,
that restore her dream of ancient voyages.
in her eyes i see a reflection of the cranes and
winches of rotterdam port, and i rub it out
with eternity’s eraser, so that she’ll sit
on the esplanade where i ask her to talk to me; and
she looks at me, in silence, with her voice crazed
by an echo of madness; and i listen to her tell me that
she doesn’t know what period she lives in, as though

naquele ano a chuva foi excessiva e cresceram tortulhos
nos olhos dos cães. os vitelos, ao espreitar a luz pelos sexos
das mães, afogavam-se em lama, no meio dos sambos. as paredes
das casas diluíam-se em nata e os oleiros desistiram de encomendar
a sua obra a deus. enormes cuidados foram inventados
para proteger o fogo nos altares e as crianças adoptaram a nudez.
as termiteiras deixaram de existir e as formigas aladas
perderam as asas. os pés dos mais-velhos fenderam-se em chagas
e as mamas das virgens, mal eram tocadas, colavam-se aos dedos
como cinza húmida. os lábios dos sexos das mulheres paridas
inchavam carnudos de uma carne branca e os ventres pendiam
como fruta mole.
naquele ano a chuva foi excessiva
e os horizontes deixaram de existir.
choveu por muito tempo até os cães perderem todo o pêlo
e as cabeleiras se destacarem como algas podres. o rei do jau
ficou colado ao trono e ao boi sagrado cresceram-lhe os olhos,
que depois cegaram. as sementes grelaram nos celeiros
e essa semente assim era servida aos homens e daí lhes ocorreu
um tal vigor que os seus sexos cresceram desmedidos
e os homens vacilaram, tendo-os nas mãos e mudos de fascínio.
a chuva choveu tanto que as serpentes saíram dos buracos
e vieram alongar-se ao pé dos paus, mantendo com esforço
as cabeças erguidas. nas terrinas do leite vicejavam musgos
e o leite das vacas alterou-se em soro, a coalhar na urina.
naquele ano a chuva choveu tanto que até nos areais cresceram
talos e as enxurradas produziram peixe e até o ferro se lavou
sozinho e os diamantes vieram rebolar nas pedras concavadas
de moer farinha. as próprias aves morreram quase todas
e apenas se salvaram as de penas brancas, que a distância atraiu,
depois comeu.
e aquela chuva aproveitou aos fósseis e houve minerais
que se animaram e até pedras comuns a transmudar-se em carne.
naquele ano a chuva choveu tanto que a memória perdeu todo
o sentido. as gargantas entupiram-se de limos
e as testas que os velhos pousavam nas mãos fundiam-se aos dedos
e os braços às pernas e os gestos de graça fundiam os corpos
e as jovens crianças ficavam coladas ao peito das mães.
só as bocas teimavam em manter-se abertas e quando mais tarde
a chuva parou, das bocas saíram grossas aves negras
que abalaram logo daquelas paragens. e a seca voltou

that was the year that the rains were excessive and mushrooms grew
in dogs’ eyes. the young bulls, looking out at the light from their mother’s crotches, drowned in the mud, in the middle of the vines. the walls of the houses dissolved in cream and the potters no longer entrusted their work to god. enormous measures were invented
to protect the altar flames and the children started to run around naked.
the termitaries ceased to exist and winged ants lost their wings. the feet of the oldest ones split open in sores and the breasts of virgins, as soon as you touched them, stuck to your fingers like wet ash. the lips of the birthing womens’ sex swelled plumply like white meat and their bellies hung like soft fruit.
that was the year the rain was excessive and the horizon ceased to exist.
it rained forever until the dogs lost all their fur and people’s hair stuck out like rotten seaweed. the king of jau got stuck to his throne and the sacred bullock’s eyes grew larger, and then went blind. the seed sprouted in the granaries and then it was served up to the men, just like that, and they were infused with such vigor that their cocks grew immeasurably and they reeled about, with the things in their hands, mute with the magic.
the rain rained so much that the snakes left their snake-holes
and stretched out next to sticks, raising their heads
with only the greatest effort. moss multiplied in the tureens of milk
and the milk of cows turned to whey which curdled in urine.
that year the rain rained so much that even the beaches grew
branches and the rushing streams spawned fish and even the iron washed itself alone and diamonds started to tumble around the stones hollowed out for milling flour. the birds themselves nearly all died and the only ones that saved themselves were those with white feathers, which the distance attracted, then ate.
and the rain was good for fossils, and there were minerals
that came alive and even common stones that were transmuted into
flesh.
that year the rain rained so much that memory was rendered
meaningless. throats were clogged with sludge and the brows that the aged held in their hands fused with their fingers,
and their arms fused to their legs and their graceful gestures smelt their bodies and the youngest children ended up glued to their mothers’ breasts.
only our mouths dared to remain open and when the rain
finally stopped, huge black birds flew from them and disappeared into the distance. and the drought came back and the world dried out. now the ancient flesh has turned to dirt,
the fossils to stone and the branches to humus.

"o sentimento dum ocidental
i
ave-marias
nas nossas ruas, ao anoitecer,
há tal soturnidade, há tal melancolia,
que as sombras, o bulício, o tejo, a maresia
despertam-me um desejo absurdo de sofrer.
o céu parece baixo e de neblina,
o gás extravasado enjoa-me, perturba;
e os edifícios, com as chaminés, e a turba
toldam-se duma cor monótona e londrina.
batem carros de aluguer, ao fundo,
levando à via-férrea os que se vão. felizes!
ocorrem-me em revista exposições, países:
madrid, paris, berlim, s. petersburgo, o mundo!
semelham-se a gaiolas, com viveiros,
as edificações somente emadeiradas:
como morcegos, ao cair das badaladas,
saltam de viga em viga os mestres carpinteiros.
voltam os calafates, aos magotes,
de jaquetão ao ombro, enfarruscados, secos;
embrenho-me, a cismar, por boqueirões, por becos,
ou erro pelos cais a que se atracam botes.
e evoco, então, as crónicas navais:
mouros, baixéis, heróis, tudo ressuscitado!
luta camões no sul, salvando um livro a nado!
singram soberbas naus que eu não verei jamais!
e o fim da tarde inspira-me; e incomoda!
de um couraçado inglês vogam os escaleres;
e em terra num tinir de louças e talheres
flamejam, ao jantar alguns hotéis da moda.
num trem de praça arengam dois dentistas;
um trôpego arlequim braceja numas andas;
os querubins do lar flutuam nas varandas;
às portas, em cabelo, enfadam-se os lojistas!
vazam-se os arsenais e as oficinas;
reluz, viscoso, o rio, apressam-se as obreiras;
e num cardume negro, hercúleas, galhofeiras,
correndo com firmeza, assomam as varinas.
vêm sacudindo as ancas opulentas!
seus troncos varonis recordam-me pilastras;
e algumas, à cabeça, embalam nas canastras
os filhos que depois naufragam nas tormentas.
descalças! nas descargas de carvão,
desde manhã à noite, a bordo das fragatas;
e apinham-se num bairro aonde miam gatas,
e o peixe podre gera os focos de infecção!
ii
noite fechada
toca-se às grades, nas cadeias. som
que mortifica e deixa umas loucuras mansas!
o aljube, em que hoje estão velhinhas e crianças,
bem raramente encerra uma mulher de “dom”!
e eu desconfio, até, de um aneurisma
tão mórbido me sinto, ao acender das luzes;
à vista das prisões, da velha sé, das cruzes,
chora-me o coração que se enche e que se abisma.
a espaços, iluminam-se os andares,
e as tascas, os cafés, as tendas, os estancos
alastram em lençol os seus reflexos brancos;
e a lua lembra o circo e os jogos malabares.
duas igrejas, num saudoso largo,
lançam a nódoa negra e fúnebre do clero:
nelas esfumo um ermo inquisidor severo,
assim que pela história eu me aventuro e alargo.
na parte que abateu no terremoto,
muram-me as construções rectas, iguais, crescidas;
afrontam-me, no resto, as íngremes subidas,
e os sinos dum tanger monástico e devoto.
mas, num recinto público e vulgar,
com bancos de namoro e exíguas pimenteiras,
brônzeo, monumental, de proporções guerreiras,
um épico doutrora ascende, num pilar!
e eu sonho o cólera, imagino a febre,
nesta acumulação de corpos enfezados;
sombrios e espectrais recolhem os soldados;
inflama-se um palácio em face de um casebre.
partem patrulhas de cavalaria
dos arcos dos quartéis que foram já conventos;
idade média! a pé, outras, a passos lentos,
derramam-se por toda a capital, que esfria.
triste cidade! eu temo que me avives
uma paixão defunta! aos lampiões distantes,
enlutam-me, alvejando, as tuas elegantes,
curvadas a sorrir às montras dos ourives.
e mais: as costureiras, as floristas
descem dos magasins, causam-me sobressaltos;
custa-lhes a elevar os seus pescoços altos
e muitas delas são comparsas ou coristas.
e eu, de luneta de uma lente só,
eu acho sempre assunto a quadros revoltados:
entro na brasserie; às mesas de emigrados,
ao riso e à crua luz joga-se o dominó.
iii
ao gás
e saio. a noite pesa, esmaga. nos
passeios de lajedo arrastam-se as impuras.
ó moles hospitais! sai das embocaduras
um sopro que arripia os ombros quase nus.
cercam-me as lojas, tépidas. eu penso
ver círios laterais, ver filas de capelas,
com santos e fiéis, andores, ramos, velas,
em uma catedral de um comprimento imenso.
as burguesinhas do catolicismo
resvalam pelo chão minado pelos canos;
e lembram-me, ao chorar doente dos pianos,
as freiras que os jejuns matavam de histerismo.
num cutileiro, de avental, ao torno,
um forjador maneja um malho, rubramente;
e de uma padaria exala-se, inda quente,
um cheiro salutar e honesto a pão no forno.
e eu que medito um livro que exacerbe,
quisera que o real e a análise mo dessem;
casas de confecções e modas resplandecem;
pelas vitrines olha um ratoneiro imberbe.
longas descidas! não poder pintar
com versos magistrais, salubres e sinceros,
a esguia difusão dos vossos reverberos,
e a vossa palidez romântica e lunar!
que grande cobra, a lúbrica pessoa,
que espartilhada escolhe uns xales com debuxo!
sua excelência atrai, magnética, entre luxo,
que ao longo dos balcões de mogno se amontoa.
e aquela velha, de bandós! por vezes,
a sua traîne imita um leque antigo, aberto,
nas barras verticais, a duas tintas. perto,
escarvam, à vitória, os seus mecklemburgueses.
desdobram-se tecidos estrangeiros;
plantas ornamentais secam nos mostradores;
flocos de pós de arroz pairam sufocadores,
e em nuvens de cetins requebram-se os caixeiros.
mas tudo cansa! apagam-se nas frentes
os candelabros, como estrelas, pouco a pouco;
da solidão regouga um cauteleiro rouco;
tornam-se mausoléus as armações fulgentes.
“dó da miséria!... compaixão de mim!...”
e, nas esquinas, calvo, eterno, sem repouso,
pede-me esmola um homenzinho idoso,
meu velho professor nas aulas de latim!
iv
horas mortas
o tecto fundo de oxigénio, de ar,
estende-se ao comprido, ao meio das trapeiras;
vêm lágrimas de luz dos astros com olheiras,
enleva-me a quimera azul de transmigrar.
por baixo, que portões! que arruamentos!
um parafuso cai nas lajes, às escuras:
colocam-se taipais, rangem as fechaduras,
e os olhos dum caleche espantam-me, sangrentos.
e eu sigo, como as linhas de uma pauta
a dupla correnteza augusta das fachadas;
pois sobem, no silêncio, infaustas e trinadas,
as notas pastoris de uma longínqua flauta.
se eu não morresse, nunca! e eternamente
buscasse e conseguisse a perfeição das cousas!
esqueço-me a prever castíssimas esposas,
que aninhem em mansões de vidro transparente!
ó nossos filhos! que de sonhos ágeis,
pousando, vos trarão a nitidez às vidas!
eu quero as vossas mães e irmãs estremecidas,
numas habitações translúcidas e frágeis.
ah! como a raça ruiva do porvir,
e as frotas dos avós, e os nómadas ardentes,
nós vamos explorar todos os continentes
e pelas vastidões aquáticas seguir!
mas se vivemos, os emparedados,
sem árvores, no vale escuro das muralhas!...
julgo avistar, na treva, as folhas das navalhas
e os gritos de socorro ouvir estrangulados.
e nestes nebulosos corredores
nauseiam-me, surgindo, os ventres das tabernas;
na volta, com saudade, e aos bordos sobre as pernas,
cantam, de braço dado, uns tristes bebedores.
eu não receio, todavia, os roubos;
afastam-se, a distância, os dúbios caminhantes;
e sujos, sem ladrar, ósseos, febris, errantes,
amareladamente, os cães parecem lobos.
e os guardas, que revistam as escadas,
caminham de lanterna e servem de chaveiros;
por cima, as imorais, nos seus roupões ligeiros,
tossem, fumando sobre a pedra das sacadas.
e, enorme, nesta massa irregular
de prédios sepulcrais, com dimensões de montes,
a dor humana busca os amplos horizontes,
e tem marés, de fel, como um sinistro mar!","the feeling of a westerner
i
vespers
when evening falls across our streets
and sullen melancholy fills the air,
the tagus, the tang, the shadows and bustle
bring me an absurd desire to suffer.
the sky hangs low and seems all hazy;
the gas from the streetlamps makes me queasy;
the tumult of buildings, chimneys and people
is cloaked in a dullish, londonish hue.
oh lucky travellers in hired coaches
now hieing to the railway station! countries
and exhibitions file past me: madrid,
paris, berlin, st petersburg, the world!
the timber frames of future buildings
resemble cages for keeping animals;
like swooping bats the carpenters leap
from beam to beam at the sound of the bell.
clusters of callous, tar-smeared caulkers
return from the slipways, coats on their shoulders;
i wander through alleys that lead to the river
or walk by the wharves where boats are docked.
i evoke the ocean chronicles: the moors,
old vessels and heroes – all resurrected!
shipwrecked camões swims his book to shore! (1)
great carracks that i’ll never see ride the waves!
the twilight inspires, and also disturbs me!
an english battleship launches its cutters
while swank hotels on land bedazzle
with china and flatware clinking at dinner.
two dentists argue inside a streetcar;
a clumsy clown is struggling on stilts;
children flit, like cherubs, on balconies;
hatless, bored shopkeepers wait at their doors!
the shipyards and workshops are emptying out;
the river glints thickly, the workwomen hurry;
and a black school of herculean fishwives
bursts out of nowhere, joking, laughing.
wagging sumptuous hips they come!
their manly torsos remind me of pillars;
and some, in the baskets on their heads,
rock sons who’ll one day drown in storms.
on frigates – barefoot! – they unload coal (2)
from dawn to dusk, then crowd together
in a neighbourhood where cats meow
and the rotting fish breed infection!
ii
after dark
prisoners bang on the bars of their cells –
a sound that rattles my nerves with shame!
the aljube jail, for old women and children,
rarely encloses a titled lady!
i feel so ill as the lights come on
i worry i might have an aneurysm;
the sight of the jails, crosses, cathedral,
fills and sinks my heart with tears.
one floor after another lights up,
and cafés, restaurants, tobacco and other shops
spread like a sheet their white reflections.
the moon brings jugglers, the circus, to mind.
on an ancient square two churches raise
the clergy’s black, funereal spectre;
i sketch there a lonely, dour inquisitor,
daring to extend myself into history.
in quarters which the earthquake flattened
equal, straight buildings wall me in; (3)
everywhere else i face steep streets
and the tolling of pious, monastic bells.
but gracing a common, public square
with lovers’ benches and lithe pepper trees
a war-sized monument cast in bronze
stands, on a pillar, for an epic that was! (4)
and in this assemblage of stunted bodies
i think of the fever, imagine the cholera;
returning soldiers look sombre as ghosts;
a gleaming palace stands opposite a hovel.
mounted patrolmen set out from the archways
of army barracks that once were convents;
the middle ages! others, on foot,
range through the capital, now turning cold.
sad town! i dread you’ll arouse a dead passion
in me! i mourn upon seeing your elegant
ladies so white in the lamp-lit distance,
leaning and smiling at jewellers’ windows.
coming down from the department stores,
the florists and dressmakers wrench my gut;
they’re hardly able to hold up their heads,
and many are walk-ons and chorus girls.
even in sordid human tableaus
i, with my pince-nez, find subject matter:
i enter the beerhouse; at the immigrants’ tables,
harshly lit, they laugh and play dominoes.
iii
by gaslight
and i go back out. the night’s weight crushes.
impure women roam the sidewalks.
o languid hospitals! ill-clad shoulders
shiver from drafts where streets open up.
warm shops surround me. i think i’m seeing
flanking candles, rows of chapels
with saints and the faithful, flowers, more candles,
more saints, in a vastly long cathedral.
the bourgeois women of catholicism
slip on the ground that’s tunnelled by drainpipes.
to me they recall, with their whining pianos,
the nuns who, fasting, died of madness.
an aproned knife maker, working the lathe,
redhotly wields his blacksmith’s hammer;
and bread, still warm, from the baker’s oven
sends forth its honest, wholesome smell.
and i, whose goal is a book that galls,
want it to show and examine what’s real.
boutiques shine with the latest fashions;
a street urchin gapes at their window displays.
o long descents! could i but paint
with skilled, sincere, salubrious verses
the delicate shimmering of your streetlamps
and all your romantic moonlit pallor!
that sensual, corseted creature selecting
printed shawls – she moves like a snake!
her excellence is a magnet amidst
the finery piled on mahogany counters.
and that old dame with coiled plaits!
her train with its vertical, two-tone stripes
mocks a spread fan! her mecklenburg horses
wait with the carriage, pawing the pavement.
decorative plants wilt on the tables
where clerks unroll their foreign fabrics;
in clouds of satins they bow and smile;
rice powder hovers and chokes the air.
but all grows weary! slowly, like stars,
the storefronts’ hanging lights go dim;
the glittering buildings become mausoleums;
a lone, hoarse voice hawks lottery tickets.
and there on a corner: “please, sir! take pity!”
whenever i pass him, that little old man,
bald and eternal, begs for alms:
the teacher at school who taught me latin!
iv
the dead hours
the lofty ceiling of air, of oxygen,
runs between the facing rooftops;
the stars’ tired eyes shed tears of light;
blue dreams of transmigration exalt me.
below all that, what portals! what streets!
i hear, in the dark, a screw hit the ground,
the clacking of shutters, the jangle of locks;
and the bloodshot eyes of a buggy scare me.
i follow, like lines on a music stave,
the stately double row of façades
while pastoral notes from a distant flute
trill, in the silence, a gloomy warning.
oh, if i’d never die! if forever
i’d seek and attain the perfection of things!
i lose myself envisioning wives
who chastely nest in clear-glass mansions!
dear sons! what swift dreams, alighting,
will bring sharp clarity to your lives!
i want the mothers and sisters you love
to live in luminous, fragile homes.
ah! like our grandfathers’ fleets, like fervent
nomads, like the ruddy race to come, (5)
we’ll go and explore every continent
and sail across the watery expanses!
but how, if we live enclosed by stone
in a dark and treeless valley of walls?
i think i see knives flash in the shadows
and hear a strangled cry for help.
and along these murky corridors
the taverns, if i peer in, appall me.
some sorry drunks are staggering home
and sing, arms joined, for old time’s sake.
but i’m not afraid of being robbed;
the dubious characters fall behind me.
the scrawny and mangy dogs don’t bark;
they look a little like yellowish wolves.
and those keepers of keys, the night watchmen,
scan with their lanterns each entryway;
above them loose women, in scanty robes,
smoke and cough at the balcony windows.
and looming out of that jagged mass
of tomblike buildings tall as hills,
human pain, like a baleful sea,
seeks vast horizons for its bitter tides!",pt_XX,en_XX,"The feeling of a Western West .

quem quer que lhe tivesse concebido os ossos, era então visível o objectivo de os fazer florir. deles brotaria a pele, o céu, a encenação da glória. tudo isso mais não eram, entretanto, do que imagens em apuros, imagens atacadas por memórias em conflito com o presente, ou mesmo com o passado onde pareciam radicar, e que, esbeiçando-se nos bordos, davam lugar a que o esquecimento sobre elas actuasse como uma espécie de ácido sulfúrico.
de cada vez que o invadia, a enxurrada da memória ascendia-lhe assim a um tal nível da consciência que os seus próprios ossos, deixando de ser pontos fixos e estáveis aos quais ele se pudesse segurar, vinham, desmantelados, boiar à superfície das águas borrascosas, de mistura

each time it rushed in on him, the torrent of memories rose to such a height of consciousness that his very bones ceased being fixed and stable points he could hold on to. dismantled, they ended up floating on the surface of the stormy waters, mixed up among his innards, with only his heart still apparently in place, as if inflating and keeping his other parts afloat among the grease and tumult of remembrances.",pt_XX,en_XX,"<unk> <unk> <unk> .

aproveitando a sombra débil e ambulante.
sentado na boleia, as rédeas na mão morena
descuidadas, um homem cisma, confia
do caminho ao macho lento a decisão.
outros homens a pé e mulheres novas
entretêm de riso a caminhada espessa.
logo após, sobre os burros, os pertences.

tiram partido do precário trote. as crianças
de peito sugam em sonolenta teima

às hortas laterais breves saltos furtivos.

de alguma enfermidade menos limpa
e neles cravam dentes de fome milenária.
dizem que as mulheres estão na intimidade
das estrelas e a troco de uns mil-réis
lêem nas mãos destinos coloridos.
dizem que roubam quintais e assaltam capoeiras,
e os aldeões, em pânico secreto,
os expulsam com voz impiedosa e decidida mão
das cercanias do seu chão governado.
dizem que enganam os incautos campónios
em negócios sempre escuros de animais,
em que fazem passar por uma estampa
o mais escalavrado e cego dos cavalos.

trocar com as bengalas possantes e vistosas

"como se faz o poema
para falarmos do meio de obter o poema,
a retórica não serve. trata-se de uma coisa simples, que não
precisa de requintes nem de fórmulas. apanha-se
uma flor, por exemplo, mas que não seja dessas flores que crescem
no meio do campo, nem das que se vendem nas lojas
ou nos mercados. é uma flor de sílabas, em que as
pétalas são as vogais, e o caule uma consoante. põe-se
no jarro da estrofe, e deixa-se estar. para que não morra,
basta um pedaço de primavera na água, que se vai
buscar à imaginação, quando está um dia de chuva,
ou se faz entrar pela janela, quando o ar fresco
da manhã enche o quarto de azul. então,
a flor confunde-se com o poema, mas ainda não é
o poema. para que ele nasça, a flor precisa
de encontrar cores mais naturais do que essas
que a natureza lhe deu. podem ser as cores do teu
rosto – a sua brancura, quando o sol vem ter contigo,
ou o fundo dos teus olhos em que todas as cores
da vida se confundem, com o brilho da vida. depois,
deito essas cores sobre a corola, e vejo-as descerem
para as folhas, como a seiva que corre pelos
veios invisíveis da alma. posso, então, colher a flor,
e o que tenho na mão é este poema que
me deste.","how to make a poem
if we’re going to talk about how to make a poem,
rhetoric has nothing to do with it. it’s simpler than that, and doesn’t
require subtleties or formulas. pick
a flower, for example, but not one of those flowers that grow
in the middle of fields, nor the ones they sell in stores,
or in the markets. a flower of syllables rather, in which the
petals are vowels, and the stem is the consonant. place it
in the vase of the stanza, and let it be. so that it doesn’t die,
it’s enough to put a little spring in the water, which,
on a rainy day, is fetched from the imagination,
or is pushed in through the window when the cool air
of morning fills the blue room. this is when
the flower begins to seem like a poem, but it’s still not
the poem. for it to really sprout, the flower needs
to find more natural colors than those
which nature gave it. they might be the colors
of your complexion – its whiteness, when the sun falls on you,
or the depths of your eyes in which all the colors
of life mix with the sheen of life. after that,
i pour these colors over the corolla, and watch them descend
to the leaves, like sap which runs through
the invisible veins of the soul. i can then pick the flower,
and what i have in my hand is this poem
that you gave me.",pt_XX,en_XX,"How do you make the poem ?

"para agradar a uma sombra
agora que já chorei o meu papel de solitário
posso virar a folha e declarar que, na verdade,
eu nunca estive sozinho. tive sempre a boa companhia
da minha sombra. e não posso dizer
que nos déssemos mal: uns dias pior, outros pior.
como todos os casais. tínhamos (e temos)
a mesma idade, os mesmos gostos musicais,
um amor paralelo por fogo de lenha,
líamos os livros a meias, quase não gastávamos
nenhum oxigénio.
dos dois era ela quem insistia, às vezes,
para irmos dançar. mas eu, é claro, detestava
o tremedal das discotecas; amava mais depressa
o movimento descritivo dos romances
do que a luz hipotecada de um corpo distante.
com o tempo, no entanto, foi crescendo esse litígio.
as nossas relações foram perdendo vulto
à medida que ela convidava mais gente
para a nossa cama. até que um dia chegou a casa
e apresentou-me “o amor da nossa vida; agora
somos três”. e assim a minha sombra,
a minha ingrata começou a dizer coisas lacerantes.
por exemplo: “vai tu ao cinema. nós ficamos.”
ou então: “bem podemos, de vez em quando,
caminhar separados, ou não achas?” e fecha-se
no quarto com a outra, em colóquios ofegantes.
altura em que, de raiva, saio porta fora.
uma vida a três é talvez menos longa do que uma vida
a dois. há um milímetro agora de distância entre mim
e a sombra. o espaço bastante para um raio de luz.
não ficámos, realmente, pior do que estávamos.

que semeiam no quintal, felizes como duas estrelinhas
de cinema. nem sei o que diga. parecem crianças.","to please a shadow
now that i’ve wept my part as a lonely man,
i can turn the script over and declare that, in fact,
i’ve never been alone. i’ve always had the good company
of my shadow. and i have to say
we’ve done all right together, with bad days and worse days,
like all couples. we were (and are) the same
age, with the same musical tastes
and a parallel fondness for sitting by the fire,
reading the same books, using almost
no oxygen.
she was the one who sometimes insisted
we go dancing, whereas i naturally hated
the scuzziness of discotheques, preferring
the descriptive movement of novels
to the mortgaged light of a distant body.
the tension between us increased over time,
with things going downhill when she started
inviting other people into our bed. until
one day she arrived home and introduced me to
“the love of our life; now we’re a threesome”.
and so my shadow, that ingrate,
began saying the most atrocious things.
such as: “you go to the movies. we’re staying home.”
or: “we could walk separately now and then,
don’t you think?” and she shuts herself up in the bedroom
for impassioned (breathless) conversations with the other.
at which point i leave the house in a huff.
a life shared by three is perhaps shorter than one
shared by two. now there’s a millimeter of distance between me
and my shadow. enough of an interval for a ray of light.

lhe iluminava as tardes e as noites.

i’d met him at the fandango
and knew only that a tearless sadness
lit up his afternoons and evenings.

facing another, united by the quasi-splendor

without neighbors – an aluminum and plywood
shack that made the word despair
an inadequate euphemism. the dog,
at least, was glad to see us arrive.
then he cried, over nothing. he merely wanted
a real shoulder where he could lean his head
which his wife and daughters would no longer even kiss
in a dream. he needed no words or gestures,
just an ear to hear him share the unshareable
which perhaps (i don’t quite remember) he called sorrow.

could have killed (but not him) for a beer

shook him and said i really had to go. he kissed
my hand, thanking me with his rotted smile

lyrical attempt, dying among the cabbages
and junk that made his solitude less solitary.

so rude. she’d do away

she says writing with tears

chamar alguém aos resíduos

diários. não importa: cruzaram-se
connosco, sentaram-se por vezes
à mesma mesa, acreditaram até
no terno suplício do amor.

para morrer cada vez mais, tolerando
dias de aluguer, casas ligeiramente
inabitáveis. porque os outros, na
verdade, não passam de mortos imperfeitos.
estão, como nós, um pouco demasiado vivos.

to call the placental remains

whose action is all but predetermined
somebody.
only the dead truly
exist. they wrote or didn’t
write books, love letters,
diaries. no matter: they crossed
our paths, sometimes sat
at the same table, and even believed
in the sweet torture of love.
they had real hands when they touched
the pubescent face they were saying farewell to.
a kiss, though it kissed only wrinkles,
was able to make the mornings less cold.
the dead aren’t very good at farewells,
even if they’re precise and sincere
as never before in the moment they descend
into the earth and won’t let us
partake with them a cigarette,
one last drink, a species of destiny.
the dead are frightfully real.
a whole life is insufficient
for us to kill them all, one
by one, as the most basic metaphysical
hygiene would surely recommend.
and yet they give us the necessary strength
to die more and more, to endure
our rented days, these homes not quite fit
to live in. because the truth is that other
people are merely the imperfect dead.
they, like us, are a bit too alive.
but perhaps they’ll one day write
a poem like this (and it might not even be
a poem, let alone like this) which denotes,

"pedaços de vinil com lama
devia ser o disco mais ouvido:
a quinta sinfonia, numa gravação
de klemperer. as manhãs
e as tardes auguravam um futuro
melhor, prendados costumes
que depressa perdi. já então olhava
para a taberna da ana,
enchendo a janela do meu quarto.
tinha medo da sombra, do silêncio,
adivinhando em cada passo o monstro
que me habitava. e lia, para não pensar,
desacreditados escritores franceses.
um dia, de tanto o amar,
peguei no disco e quebrei-o
em pequenos pedaços de vinil
– para doerem mais, melhor.
mantive, não sei bem porquê,
a dura capa de cartão,
essa fúnebre alegoria da infância.
e o que sobrou do disco foi parar
ao ribeiro junto à casa dos meus pais.
mais tarde, o ribeiro com hortas
de domingo à volta foi sufocado pelo terror
de um aldeamento, versão provinciana
de condomínio fechado, num mundo
em que são cada vez mais as portas.
beethoven, esse, quase deixou
de me comover, soterrado como as rãs
pelas mãos invisíveis de quem mata.
o que me comove, passado tanto
tempo, é perceber que fiz a esse disco
o mesmo que faço e volto a fazer
aos corpos que julgo amar:

que doam sempre um pouco mais.","grimy bits of vinyl
it must have been the most-played record:
the fifth symphony, conducted
by klemperer. the mornings
and afternoons promised a better
future, virtuous habits,
which i soon forgot. i was already eyeing
ana’s tavern,
which filled my bedroom window.
i feared the shadows, silence,
feeling in each footstep the monster
inside me. and i read, so as not to think,
discredited french writers.
i loved it so much that one day
i grabbed the record and broke it
to bits – tiny bits of vinyl –
so that they’d hurt even more.
i’m not sure why, but i kept
the stiff cardboard jacket,
that lugubrious allegory of childhood.
and the remains of the record ended up
in the stream next to my parents’ house.
later on the stream, flanked by weekend
vegetable patches, was strangled by an implacable
housing development, the provincial version
of a gated condominium, in a world
with ever more doors.
as for beethoven, buried like the frogs
by invisible killing hands,
he almost ceased to move me.

later, is to realize i did to that record

do alto das muralhas de ohrid onde
acorrera aos gritos desvairados dos vigias,
o rei samuel avistou o seu exército desfigurado,
arrastando-se entre as montanhas da macedónia.
aos catorze mil homens tinham sido
arrancados os olhos por ordem do imperador
e a um em cada cem mandara ele, basílio ii,
fosse poupado um olho para conduzirem o regresso
dessa manada cega. depois de atravessarem altas neves
vinham-se agora despenhando para o lago,
tropeçando, agarrados uns aos outros,
a tortura espelhada nas contorções das faces,
o sangue a empapar-lhes os andrajos. e o rei,
tomado pela angústia, deu um grito de dor e morreu
no alto da muralha sobre a colina e os seus bosques e pomares
que o lago placidamente reflectia.
nesse instante compreendeu como era ambígua
a força cega do destino e em nenhum mosteiro
podia a iconostase explicar-lhe esse cruel mistério:

entre as chamas trémulas emudeciam

gouged by order of the emperor, basil the second,
who had instructed that one eye be spared in every
hundredth man so that they could lead the return
of that blind herd. having crossed over the high snows
they now came rushing down toward the lake,
stumbling and grabbing on to one another,
the torture mirrored in their facial contortions,
blood soaking their tattered clothes, and the king,
seized by anguish, uttered a shout of grief and died
on the heights of the walls over the hill and his forests and groves
which the lake so peacefully reflected.
in that instant he understood just how ambiguous
the blind force of destiny was, and in no monastery
could the screens of icons have elucidated that cruel mystery:

uma mulher estava nos cuidados intensivos
enevoada em suas ligaduras
e tubos nas narinas e nas mãos
que se agitavam e tudo era metálico,
mas ela, a retalhada,
era só tempo incerto, interrogado e trôpego,
só gemido sem voz quando o homem ansioso
se debruçava na contagem dos segundos,
mas ela, a gotejante,
era um puro intervalo numa frouxa fronteira,
só um peso de pálpebras e noite espessa, quando ele, debruçado,
murmurava as palavras, as que ela não ouvia.
terminada a visita, um olhar de relance, um último
desse dia, cercou-a de silêncios pensativos.
a interrogação, a negação da esperança, são como a rosa negra
das condições da esperança.
despiu a bata branca obrigatória, foi-se devagar
e guardou-lhe o rosto translúcido envolto em gazes leves.
há quanto tempo foi? em que lugar, em que manhã furtiva da memória?
quem era o homem? que palavras proferia?
hoje não sei. é como ver da rua uma figura entre cortinas
numa corrente de ar, às vezes penso que era eu,
mas pergunto também, seria alguém por mim, numa curva do tempo,
a murmurar tão baixo palavras esquecidas?
mas se não era eu, como é que soube dessa voz comovida
a resvalar assim até ser inaudível
fora do coração? e se era eu, como pude
tão de dentro falar, tão apagadamente?
porque eu procuro outros andamentos do mundo,
outros nós na garganta, mais pensados a frio, outras intensidades
sacudidas, mais distantes da emoção imediata,
e nunca mais diria palavras tão obscuras.
não interessa quem era. os mares, os ventos
rolaram e rodaram e foram erodindo verdades, circunstâncias.

leaned over in the countdown of seconds,

was a pure interlude on a weak frontier,
just the weight of eyelids and thick night, when he, leaning over,

"um cão para pompeia
aos amantes enlaçados contraponho
um cão de pompeia, decerto ele andaria
a brincar junto ao forum, à cata de algum osso,
quando o vesúvio o caçou, mais lesto,
para moldá-lo em pedra-pomes.
insisto em vê-lo como um bicho magro e descuidado,
de penúria diuturna. passou de leve
pelos peristilos, alheio ao luxo, à corrupção,
à astrologia, e nunca dos triclínios
lhe caiu um naco envenenado, nunca se tornou
nem animal simbólico, nem mito que ganisse.
nunca foi encontrado nas escavações, mas é para aqui chamado.
era um cão, just a dog, com pulgas e
que alçava a perna como todos os cães
e ladrava e mordia quando era preciso.
fazia pela vida e, fauno das esquinas, pelas cadelas no cio.
alguma tabuleta diria cave canem em tésseras minúsculas,
sem alaridos da história, e só sobreviveu
nos livros de latim expurgados, misturada
com a guerra das gálias e alguns nomes de deuses.
eu canto um cão sem fábula nem pedigree, que não fugiu aos fados,
um rafeiro vulgar, digamos, de plínio
o velho que, a propósito, morreu perto dali,
talvez uivando, uns dias depois dele.
“você é um cerebral”, disse-me cloé, flava e enervada.
“sim”, disse-lhe eu com prudência, “mas há tantos.
e o amor e a morte sempre foram pensáveis”.

rather than a pair of embracing lovers i propose
a dog from pompei. one that was no doubt
frolicking next to the forum, in search of a bone,
when friskier vesuvius caught and molded him

on seeing him as a scrawny, neglected creature
for whom poverty was a way of life. he skipped
through peristyles, a stranger to luxury, to corruption
to astrology, and no poisoned morsel ever befell him
from the triclinia, he never became
a symbolic animal or barking myth.
he was never found in any excavation, but we summon him now.
he was just a dog, un chien, who had fleas and
raised his paw like all dogs
and yelped and bit when necessary.
he lived for today and, faun of street corners, for bitches in heat.

making no mark in history, surviving only
in expurgated books in latin, mixed up
with the gallic wars and a few names of gods.

perhaps screaming, a few days later.

"para a educação sentimental
tantas vezes se vive de uma arrebatada
noção dos contrastes mais fortes entre o bem e o
mal, entre a grandeza e a abjecção, entre as rápidas
peripécias de um heroísmo ansioso e o destino inexorável,
que o melodrama é da nossa mais funda natureza,
nostálgica, obscuramente nostálgica do coração radical,
do que vai à desfilada nos sonhos contraditórios,
do que engendra imagens capciosas e julga viver em liberdade,
mas é só imprudente e explosivo, mas esbarra
nas malhas deste mundo, nos imprevistos
da traição e da morte, ou tem de renunciar perante os rasgos
mais sublimes. a paixão dilacera bruscamente as personagens
apegadas à felicidade, os obstáculos
também têm protagonistas, ajustes de contas, cruéis fulgores,
perseguições, e nos casos desvairados de amor não há saída.
desse falhanço insuportável nasce o melodrama,
lírico, incontido, entre golfadas de espiral vertiginosa
com o sangue e a memória, com o que não tem remédio e a música trágica,
em que alguém vai morrer, alguém se perde alucinado,
e alguém se salva e porventura alguém escreve
a história e alguém lhe junta a música
para as emoções serem mais opressivas e talvez mais devoradoras
e mais fáceis, e alguém tem o desejo disso, um estremecimento
de arrepio e vulgaridade, um ávido prazer inconfessado.","sentimental education
we often live according to a rash
notion of stark contrasts between good
and evil, greatness and wretchedness, the swift deeds
of an avid heroism and the inexorable march of destiny,
melodrama being part of our deepest nature,
obscurely but stubbornly nostalgic for the radical heart,
which races at top speed in contradictory dreams,
which engenders seductive images and thinks it lives in freedom,
but it’s merely reckless and explosive, it stumbles
into the world’s snares, into unexpected
treachery and death, or it must renounce in the face of the most
sublime flashes. passion rudely lacerates people
attached to happiness. the obstacles we meet
also have protagonists, scores to settle, cruel splendors,
feverish pursuits. and in desperate cases of love there’s no way out.
from that unbearable failure is born lyrical, unbridled
melodrama, amid whirling, dizzying spurts
of blood and memory, of dashed hopes and tragic music,
in which someone dies, someone goes mad,
and someone is saved, and maybe someone writes down
the story, and someone else adds music
for the emotions to be more oppressive and perhaps more consuming
and facile, and someone desires this, it makes someone feel a shiver

que alguma coisa fica para sempre nos dias

that something lingers forever in the days

into some eyes or into water
into a little or a lot of water

i’ll say loudly or softly however i’m able
with wide-open mouth or already choking

swallow a pill or let ourselves go,
pushed by the wind, beneath the eaves?

of all you desired and lose, without appeal,

order, sentenced to biblical logic
and the resignation of roman existence.

veneno para entornar nos olhos do gigante

a um vento débil entre arbustos pintados

green arms of occult practices
corpses floating on the water

a body for blocking the day’s lamps
a body for falling through a landscape of birds

surrounded by dwarfs and lilac fields

a place setting
a perfume
this or its contrary, but somehow gaping
and with many people there to see what it is
this or a population of sixty thousand souls devouring scarlet pillows on their way to the sea
and arriving, at dusk,
next to the submarines
this or a torso dislodged from a verse
and whose death makes everyone proud
o pallid city built
like a fever between two floors!
we’ll home deliver
dirt for filling up candelabras
smoldering beds for erect lovers
slates with forbidden words
– a woman for the fellow who’s losing interest in life (here, take her!),
two grandchildren for the old woman at the end of the line (that’s all we have!) –
we’ll pillage the museum give a diadem to the world and then require it to be put back in the same place,
and for you and for me, favorably situated,
some poison to pour into the giant’s eyes
this or a face a solitary face like a boat in search of a gentle breeze for the night
if we’re sand that’s sifted
in a slack wind among painted bushes
if an intention is bound to reach its shore like the ocean’s currents shipwrecks and storms
if the man of hostels and boardinghouses lifts his damp cratered forehead
if the sun outside is shining more than ever
if for a minute
it’s worth

shimmering amid the foliage of the loftiest lamps

"receita para fazer azul
se quiseres fazer azul,
pega num pedaço de céu e mete-o numa panela grande,
que possas levar ao lume do horizonte;
depois mexe o azul com um resto de vermelho
da madrugada, até que ele se desfaça;
despeja tudo num bacio bem limpo,
para que nada reste das impurezas da tarde.
por fim, peneira um resto de ouro da areia
do meio-dia, até que a cor pegue ao fundo de metal.
se quiseres, para que as cores se não desprendam
com o tempo, deita no líquido um caroço de pêssego queimado.
vê-lo-ás desfazer-se, sem deixar sinais de que alguma vez
ali o puseste; e nem o negro da cinza deixará um resto de ocre
na superfície dourada. podes, então, levantar a cor
até à altura dos olhos, e compará-la com o azul autêntico.
ambas as cores te parecerão semelhantes, sem que
possas distinguir entre uma e outra.

if you wish to make the colour blue
take a piece of sky and put it in a pot
large enough to place on the flame of the horizon.
stir into the blue a pinch of early morning red
until it dissolves. pour everything
into a brass bowl that has been well washed
to eliminate all of the afternoon’s impurities.
finally, sift in a few smidgens of gold from the sand
of midday until the colour adheres to the bottom of the bowl.
to prevent the colours from separating with time,
drop a charred peach pit into the liquid.
it will disintegrate, leaving no telltale
sign, not even – from the black ash – an ochre trace
on the golden surface. you may then raise the colour
to eye level and compare it with genuine blue.
the two colours will look so alike
that you cannot distinguish one from the other.
