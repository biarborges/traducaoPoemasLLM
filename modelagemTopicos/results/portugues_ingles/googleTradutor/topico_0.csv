"carta ao pai

de carne com dois olhos
dirigidos ao teto escuro

amorosos das mucosas

pediria para sua filhoa
a morte que desejou
a tantos de minha laia

seu cordão umbilical
com a tradição
e se deveras faria
sobrevir a eles

em que corre
o seu sangre
mas não seu deus
e ora neste leito partido
o cérebro em veias
como riachos insistentes
em correr
fora das margens
se o senhor
soubesse o dolo
com que manchei
a mesa
de todos os patriarcas
ainda pergunto-me
se me receberia
com a mansidão
que aceita na testa
o beijo desta sua filhoa
que nada mais é
que a sua imagem
e semelhança invertidas
tal espelho
que refletisse opostos
de gênero e religião
ou o desenho
animado na infância
de uma sala de justiça
onde numa tela
podia-se observar
um mundo ao avesso
e se o pai e o pai
odeiam deveras
o gerado nas normas
da biologia e religião
mais tarde porém geridos
na transgressão das leis

impõem-nos na ciência

"a viagem de alexandre à índia
andaste de um ao outro lado da terra na vida interminável,
tiveste degredos, piedosos cíumes, a fé desvanescida,
amantes paradas na lavoura, roubando-te o rosto amado.
viste vestígios de que foste a sombra de ninguém,
olhos sem pudor, do reflexo dos ferros no tropel,
franjas do domínio pueril de alexandre, olhando gaugamela.
partiste num porto de transição para o levante,
com vazios para trás, todo o tempo a poder ver,
e ao primeiro inverno, pelos cardeais das suas cinzas,
começaste a travessia que não termina, a história que não acaba.
soubeste porque se vislumbra, em lágrimas, o pinheiro da juventude,
o nome quebrado num turvo ar medido sem corda,
e a maresia do vento de feição no segundo inverno.
em troca perseguiste o que rege o homem fortuito,
segredando em palácios de mármore que são apenas pedras,
dos fracassos a que jamais alguém ajoelhara.
ao terceiro inverno descobriste o hemisfério, e ao quarto,
sem ideia de guerra ou ordem para mudar o reino,
escolheste adornar os aquedutos sob o manto dos regatos,
sentado, na brisa no tanque, ao febril entardecer.
de quem te aproximaste, no seu trajecto interminado,
sem lugar senão o que esfria na mente recortada,
naquilo que se ramifica, tornando-se na própria teia,
contigo propagou o dever de passar em toda a parte.
e quando veio o quinto inverno, e o sexto, suturaste o sangue,
trouxeste a pele à curva dos rios, acolheste o que de resto se desmorona,
e pudeste enfim, na crença dos migradores furtivos, entender que
tudo se perde noutro lugar ainda, e após esse ainda noutro
e que ao fim de cada manhã noutra manhã
tudo é incerto, tão conforme o dente-de-leão no meio de searas,
tão emudecido como a veia exausta dos não sepultados.
na mansarda onde vagueia o dia e a noite
o vento responde, cortando o centeio e o calcário, e a vela
que brilha na luz de estrelas veladas, já desaparecidas,
pisadas, mudas, engolidas aos pés do sétimo inverno,
arpoa o coração e a ruína — os meridianos despem-se, voam
em vinte e cinco anos que há pouco se beijavam, e seja dito ou não dito
o prazer que inflige um pico de tormentos
por lábios que só as mulheres conhecem
no moinho das águas da morte em varanasi,
sacode a chama de quanto vale, dura e canta
o princípio e o fim do teu poder na terra.","alexandres`s travel to india
you wandered an interminable life across the earth,
suffered exile, piteous jealousy, futile faith,
labour-arrested lovers plundering your beloved’s face.
you saw traces of having been no one’s shadow,
impudent eyes, the reflection of iron on the rampage,
hints of alexander’s puerile dominance, contemplating gaugamela.
you set off from a transient port towards the levant,
leaving emptiness behind, seeing all of time,
and in the first winter, by the cardinals of its ashes,
you started the endless crossing, the incessant history.
you knew, because the pine tree of youth can be glimpsed through tears,
of the shattered name in a cloudy mood measured without ropes,
and of the favourable sea breeze in the second winter.
in exchange you pursued that which rules the fortuitous man,
whispering in marble palaces that are but stones,
failures to which no one had ever knelt.
by the third winter you discovered the hemisphere, and by the fourth,
non intent on war or order to change the kingdom,
you chose to adorn aqueducts with the mantle of streams,
sitting by the pool breeze, in the evening´s lingering fever.
whomever you approached, in their indefinite path,
without a place except that which fades inside a patchy mind,
in that which branches out and becomes the very web,
has spread with you the duty to pass through everywhere.
and by the fifth winter, and the sixth, you stitched up the blood,
brought the skin on to the river bends, welcomed that which falls apart,
and were at last capable, with the belief of a stealthy migrant, of understanding
that all is lost yet in another place, and after this in yet another

shimmering in the light of the veiled stars already gone,

in twenty five years that were just kissing yesterday, and be it told or untold

i’m thinking of you, dear girl,
your mother’s memory haunts me.
my eyes fill up with tears,
they are bathing you gently.
you were born amid sorrow—
may it yet prove a blessing.
since fortune, struck with envy,
singled you out at birth.
gone forever was contentment,
you heard no joyful voices.
your mother’s life had ended,
while ours went on in sadness.
in anguish born and raised!
i don’t know where all this is going.
i’ve watched you grow, my girl,
with green eyes so lovely.
beauty like yours wasn’t meant
to be born in exile. curses on
fate! this was clearly a work
of malevolence, not a mistake.
here lies your mother,
and we languish in grief.
you did nothing, my girl,
to incur a loss so great.
the fates spurn reason,
and will admit no protest.
i pity your poor father,
for the pain he must lament.
i heard you crying, alone,
before anyone else. you’d not
be here, had i not been there.
still, i ask if i did right.
but surely it can’t be wrong
for you to have been born
with that elegant smile of yours,
those dazzling green eyes.
it’s an unlikely comfort
that i take for myself.
may god grant you the grace
that has eluded you till now.
beauty and good fortune,
or so the old story goes,
were once the best of friends,
but became bitterly opposed.
many hold that it’s fantasy,
but in my life i’ve seen
enough not to doubt it:
fate inflicts great damage.
no harm is ever believed;
we always expect the good.

lies an element of change,
an element of concern.",pt_XX,en_XX,"of the girl and young woman

you were born a daughter amidst sorrow
so that you may be well-begotten daughter

fortune hears you enviously:
contentment was dead
you heard no joy,
your mother was deceased,
we were all sad:
nothing in pain, in pain grown
I do not know where this will lead
I see you, beautiful daughter
with green eyes growing:
this grace of yours was not to be born in exile
may misfortune
put you more than error:
here was your grave
your mother and sorrow to us
you were not a daughter
not to die for you:
there was no reason in fate
nor is it permitted to beg
of your father I am so sorry
that he will only complain of himself:
I heard you only
first that no one else
you were not yours
I do not know if I did wrong or good:
but it cannot be lady
for any evil to be born
with this graceful smile
that you have under your green eyes:
the most doubtful comfort
is this one that I take thus
god flights of better fortune
than you had until now:
that happiness and beauty
say ancient tales
that they fought one day
being once very friendly:
many there are that it is fantasy

do not doubt

na hora em que eu mais ruía
o sol aplainava o relvado, palmeiras
ondulavam num lago turvo
longe o escaravelho porvindoiro
que as reduziu a um coto
assemelhando-as a um ananás que degrada hoje
pelos jardins
o repuxo animava sem triunfo o pântano
da juventude
as varandas em fogo
o verão começando pelo fim
horas extraordinárias aquelas
em que as aves adiavam o repouso por causa
dos insectos do turno sequente
ourados absortos estrepitantes
a hora em que mais ninguém deitava como eu
a bicicleta sobre a falta
e se sentava na relva prendendo as lágrimas
as mãos tapando o rosto o rosto entre os geolhos e uma
roda atrás a girar
não havia o ecrã de bolso oportuno
era inevitável encarar o que não tem conserto
nem nunca terá
era do dia o instante altíloquo
uma harmónica crepitava nos auscultadores
feria de morte o touro da tarde
esse búfalo ermo que se aparta da manada
para ficar-se
os subidos candeeiros acendiam
havia um muro recém pintado
sujo já por um grafito de província
um cão passava ao largo levantava o focinho ao
perfume dos jantares
que chegava de onde
se entrevia o espalha-cor dos televisores
havia o farrapo de lua
como flanela posta sobre a ganga das alturas
agraudava os dós arrumados
na caixa do futuro

o coração alpinista no avesso dos volumes

e fartura – belo desastroso feroz – lugar de forças
e destruições

puro intrínseco
procurava um celeiro urbano onde guardar
o ouro-sémen pronto a detonar
a libélula extrema o grilo inicial
a andorinha cujo ninho resulta de um cúmulo
de lama e ervas secas e rasoira
as superfícies alimentando-se no ar
nas minhas costas o exíguo refrigério
da biblioteca pública
àquela hora antro de nebulosos soldados
repousando da luta de guerrilha
hasta la derrota, siempre!
infligiam estragos mínimos a um inimigo
bronco mas relutante

that moment when i was really falling apart

billowed above the turbid lake
faraway the promised beetle
reduced those palms to a stump
until they seemed like a pineapple which these days
rots in the gardens
the fountain blandly animated the swamp
of the young
the balconies on fire
the summer beginning at its end

in which the birds delayed their naps because
of the next shift of insects

mortally wounding the afternoon’s bull

already marked with a small town’s graffito

scent of dinners

the televisions’ color-blend rose in the air

like flannel sewn onto the denim of the heights

i’m watching her:
sweet the alp in the angle of her jaw
when she wakes
the canvas soaked at dawn
the grass outside darkens just as the sun rising
dilutes sleep
the mules feed off the fleeting
boreal pastures
before us a way opens up
luminously
glued to keeping quiet
to moving
but a breeze already inflames
making us want for a lake, placing
a range on the horizon
a less uncrossable elevation
than the lowlands of lived life
we say goodbye to the humid moss
fingered between thighs
stir the last pleasure out of the little
campfire that crackled
at the shelter’s opening through the long cold hours
we stuff rucksacks
leather and straps tested
we fixed our hair
munch a bit of flour
shredded bits of jerky
swigs of steaming coffee
we, the soldiers of alexander
whom nights of whiskey never fell
whose boots don’t weigh a thing
nor shame the fevers
the rectangle left by the tent
will remain for a while marking the plot of grass
stones ringing what had been
a scintillating flame later gone dark
now pasture to the scent of the timid
animals that will wander in
sounding out this sullied bit of the scene
at this very moment our scent
sails through narrow ravines
mixed with the dust and the clamor of hoofs that brings us
straying close on the edge of precipices
our own echoing
will embarrass us
but within – more silence even than the gorse
on the cliff sides –
and hardened, soaked with mist, atypical
arching over our maps
opening compasses
jotting quick notes about the way
and the error
more goat than us more mountainous: life
this leather hard to tan",pt_XX,en_XX,"[annemarie schwarzenbach]
I look at her:
sweet the vertex in the angle of the jaw
when she wakes
the canvas soaked in the dawn
outside the grass dyes as much as the star under it
dilutes sleep
the mules feed on the fatuous
boreal pastures
in front of us a path articulates
illuminating
glued to silence
to movement
but already a breath ignites
returns to us the desire for a lake, places
on the horizon the mountain range
a less insurmountable elevation
than the plain of the lived
we say goodbye to the wet moss
fingerprinted between thighs
we shake off what is left of the pleasure
the small light that crackled at the mouth of the shelter
long cold hours
we stuff our backpacks
tested leather and bandages
straightened our hair
we put a little flour in our teeth
threads of dried meat
sips of coffee smoking
we, soldiers of alexander
who never lost the whiskey of the evenings
and the boots do not weigh
nor do the fevers vex
the rectangle where the tent was
will be marked for a while on the gazón
with the stones surrounding what was
the sparkling flame that later turned black
and is fodder for the scent of the fearful
fauna that will come
to probe this dirty part of the place
by that time our odor
will soar through ravines and gorges
mixed with the dust and the clatter of the hooves with which
we wandered on the edge of the abysses
we will produce echoes of which our modesty
will be ashamed
but inside – tacit more than the sternness
of the cliffs –
and hard, gnawing, rare
looking over the maps
uncovering compasses
taking small notes about the course
and the mistake
more of a goat than we are mountain: life

é-me indiferente: poeta, poetisa
dependerá do ritmo ou da medida –
prefiro tradutora, mas admito
que por vezes não dobro e sou narcisa.

a minha primeira poesia era
sobre chuva e choro. hoje seria
prosa, ou sobre chuva e a pólvora:
chove fora viola o vento o vidro,
a rua nunca é como os prospectos –
o meu bilhete ao mundo, espeto-o
com delicado verbo ao coração.
rebenta, murcho músculo entupido –
mil vezes fosse a vida a excepção.

se o rigor do verso não visa qualquer prova
senão procura –
ou provar o que seja de sabor.

para a máquina fotográfica,
moldar a boca ao disparo ou regular
a abertura ao diafragma. dependente
do papel revelador –

as vidas que não toco interessam-me
num desequilíbrio de voracidade e avareza.

for me it makes little difference: poet, poetess –
depends on the measure, and the stress –
i prefer translator, but admit
that i sometimes can’t be plied, i’m a narcissist.
2.
my earliest poetry was about rain
and weeping. today it would be
prose and rain, or gunpowder:
it's raining out, wind rapes the window,
a street is never like the brochures –
with fine eloquence i stab my note
to the world through my heart.
it bursts, withered muscle bloat –
a thousand times that life were more than art.
3.
if the line’s strict measure doesn’t aim to show
but is a seeking instead –
or is the taste of what it finds . . .
if i don’t write to order,
but showered by latter rain.
4.
certainly, i can pose
for the camera,
mold my mouth to the click, close
down the diaphragm. it depends
how the roll is developed –
model artist prey, i’m like everyone:
the lives i don’t touch interest me
in uneven parts of avarice and voracity.

my first poem was

mas a região mais central do nada, o pátio
furioso da potência
e neste lugar de substâncias, de objectos
as palavras são figuras do imundo, coisas que
sobraram do estampido inaugural desse dia inicial inteiro
e limpo que culminou no lugar a menos deste texto
breve logaritmo sem aplicação ou saída
resta ao poeta o embuste
de afirmar o que propende para o infindo
espiar o acesso que cada coisa consente pela fissura do milagre
e dá pelo nome de imprevisto, ou acidente

the big bang’s nimble plagiarism
the poem’s matter expands, cools
it lingers so oddly then stays put

with no reflection: hollow
asymmetrical, vestiges of that origin
positioned in a dubious place, nearly always apart
from the black hole they call literature

capable of accelerating particles
as a way of seeing not only the distance the light has covered
but the central region of nihility, the furious
patio of power

left over from the inaugural detonation of this first clean
whole day that climaxed in the minus-one ground of this brief logarithmic
text, purposeless and without any application

to secretly observe the access each thing allows through the fissure of miracle
and which goes by the name of chance, or accident

"a europa em roterdão
dói-me o coração da europa, com as suas veias inchadas
pelo vento do ocidente, e as mãos gretadas pelo gelo
dos invernos. sentei-me com a europa num bar de roterdão,
desenhando na cabeça os mapas do mundo; e obriguei-a
a beber o café holandês, com os seus lábios doentes,
como se a europa não fosse o continente insone
dos últimos milénios, varrido pelos temporais da
mitologia, de crença abalada por um terror ateu.
vi a europa nesse café de roterdão, antes de sair
para as ruas desenhadas a compasso e esquadro;
perguntei-lhe para onde queria ir; e ouvi o seu
murmúrio despir-se de uma palidez plural, como
se ela quisesse ser o rosto único da multidão,
e passear num anonimato de rua cosmopolita,
ouvindo as vozes que lhe falam de ilhas e praias,
restituindo-lhe um sonho de antigas viagens.
vejo nos seus olhos um reflexo das gruas e
guindastes do porto de roterdão, e apago-o com
a borracha da eternidade, para que ela se sente
na esplanada onde lhe peço que me fale; e
ela olha-me, em silêncio, com a voz alucinada
num eco de loucura; e ouço-a dizer-me que
não sabe em que tempo vive, como se fosse
eu que lhe tivesse de ensinar o caminho.

naquele ano a chuva foi excessiva e cresceram tortulhos
nos olhos dos cães. os vitelos, ao espreitar a luz pelos sexos
das mães, afogavam-se em lama, no meio dos sambos. as paredes
das casas diluíam-se em nata e os oleiros desistiram de encomendar
a sua obra a deus. enormes cuidados foram inventados
para proteger o fogo nos altares e as crianças adoptaram a nudez.
as termiteiras deixaram de existir e as formigas aladas
perderam as asas. os pés dos mais-velhos fenderam-se em chagas
e as mamas das virgens, mal eram tocadas, colavam-se aos dedos
como cinza húmida. os lábios dos sexos das mulheres paridas
inchavam carnudos de uma carne branca e os ventres pendiam
como fruta mole.
naquele ano a chuva foi excessiva
e os horizontes deixaram de existir.
choveu por muito tempo até os cães perderem todo o pêlo
e as cabeleiras se destacarem como algas podres. o rei do jau
ficou colado ao trono e ao boi sagrado cresceram-lhe os olhos,
que depois cegaram. as sementes grelaram nos celeiros
e essa semente assim era servida aos homens e daí lhes ocorreu
um tal vigor que os seus sexos cresceram desmedidos
e os homens vacilaram, tendo-os nas mãos e mudos de fascínio.
a chuva choveu tanto que as serpentes saíram dos buracos
e vieram alongar-se ao pé dos paus, mantendo com esforço
as cabeças erguidas. nas terrinas do leite vicejavam musgos
e o leite das vacas alterou-se em soro, a coalhar na urina.
naquele ano a chuva choveu tanto que até nos areais cresceram
talos e as enxurradas produziram peixe e até o ferro se lavou
sozinho e os diamantes vieram rebolar nas pedras concavadas
de moer farinha. as próprias aves morreram quase todas
e apenas se salvaram as de penas brancas, que a distância atraiu,
depois comeu.
e aquela chuva aproveitou aos fósseis e houve minerais
que se animaram e até pedras comuns a transmudar-se em carne.
naquele ano a chuva choveu tanto que a memória perdeu todo
o sentido. as gargantas entupiram-se de limos
e as testas que os velhos pousavam nas mãos fundiam-se aos dedos
e os braços às pernas e os gestos de graça fundiam os corpos
e as jovens crianças ficavam coladas ao peito das mães.
só as bocas teimavam em manter-se abertas e quando mais tarde
a chuva parou, das bocas saíram grossas aves negras
que abalaram logo daquelas paragens. e a seca voltou
e o mundo secou. a carne antiga a dar-se agora em terra,
os fósseis em pedra e as ramas em húmus.
e os passos poliram pouco a pouco as formas.

that was the year that the rains were excessive and mushrooms grew
in dogs’ eyes. the young bulls, looking out at the light from their mother’s crotches, drowned in the mud, in the middle of the vines. the walls of the houses dissolved in cream and the potters no longer entrusted their work to god. enormous measures were invented
to protect the altar flames and the children started to run around naked.
the termitaries ceased to exist and winged ants lost their wings. the feet of the oldest ones split open in sores and the breasts of virgins, as soon as you touched them, stuck to your fingers like wet ash. the lips of the birthing womens’ sex swelled plumply like white meat and their bellies hung like soft fruit.

it rained forever until the dogs lost all their fur and people’s hair stuck out like rotten seaweed. the king of jau got stuck to his throne and the sacred bullock’s eyes grew larger, and then went blind. the seed sprouted in the granaries and then it was served up to the men, just like that, and they were infused with such vigor that their cocks grew immeasurably and they reeled about, with the things in their hands, mute with the magic.
the rain rained so much that the snakes left their snake-holes
and stretched out next to sticks, raising their heads
with only the greatest effort. moss multiplied in the tureens of milk
and the milk of cows turned to whey which curdled in urine.
that year the rain rained so much that even the beaches grew
branches and the rushing streams spawned fish and even the iron washed itself alone and diamonds started to tumble around the stones hollowed out for milling flour. the birds themselves nearly all died and the only ones that saved themselves were those with white feathers, which the distance attracted, then ate.
and the rain was good for fossils, and there were minerals
that came alive and even common stones that were transmuted into
flesh.
that year the rain rained so much that memory was rendered
meaningless. throats were clogged with sludge and the brows that the aged held in their hands fused with their fingers,
and their arms fused to their legs and their graceful gestures smelt their bodies and the youngest children ended up glued to their mothers’ breasts.
only our mouths dared to remain open and when the rain
finally stopped, huge black birds flew from them and disappeared into the distance. and the drought came back and the world dried out. now the ancient flesh has turned to dirt,
the fossils to stone and the branches to humus.

há tal soturnidade, há tal melancolia,
que as sombras, o bulício, o tejo, a maresia
despertam-me um desejo absurdo de sofrer.
o céu parece baixo e de neblina,
o gás extravasado enjoa-me, perturba;
e os edifícios, com as chaminés, e a turba
toldam-se duma cor monótona e londrina.
batem carros de aluguer, ao fundo,
levando à via-férrea os que se vão. felizes!
ocorrem-me em revista exposições, países:
madrid, paris, berlim, s. petersburgo, o mundo!
semelham-se a gaiolas, com viveiros,
as edificações somente emadeiradas:
como morcegos, ao cair das badaladas,
saltam de viga em viga os mestres carpinteiros.
voltam os calafates, aos magotes,
de jaquetão ao ombro, enfarruscados, secos;
embrenho-me, a cismar, por boqueirões, por becos,
ou erro pelos cais a que se atracam botes.

singram soberbas naus que eu não verei jamais!

e em terra num tinir de louças e talheres
flamejam, ao jantar alguns hotéis da moda.
num trem de praça arengam dois dentistas;
um trôpego arlequim braceja numas andas;
os querubins do lar flutuam nas varandas;
às portas, em cabelo, enfadam-se os lojistas!
vazam-se os arsenais e as oficinas;
reluz, viscoso, o rio, apressam-se as obreiras;
e num cardume negro, hercúleas, galhofeiras,
correndo com firmeza, assomam as varinas.
vêm sacudindo as ancas opulentas!
seus troncos varonis recordam-me pilastras;
e algumas, à cabeça, embalam nas canastras
os filhos que depois naufragam nas tormentas.

desde manhã à noite, a bordo das fragatas;
e apinham-se num bairro aonde miam gatas,

tão mórbido me sinto, ao acender das luzes;
à vista das prisões, da velha sé, das cruzes,
chora-me o coração que se enche e que se abisma.
a espaços, iluminam-se os andares,
e as tascas, os cafés, as tendas, os estancos
alastram em lençol os seus reflexos brancos;
e a lua lembra o circo e os jogos malabares.

muram-me as construções rectas, iguais, crescidas;

nesta acumulação de corpos enfezados;
sombrios e espectrais recolhem os soldados;
inflama-se um palácio em face de um casebre.

dos arcos dos quartéis que foram já conventos;

derramam-se por toda a capital, que esfria.

enlutam-me, alvejando, as tuas elegantes,
curvadas a sorrir às montras dos ourives.

descem dos magasins, causam-me sobressaltos;
custa-lhes a elevar os seus pescoços altos
e muitas delas são comparsas ou coristas.

the gas from the streetlamps makes me queasy;
the tumult of buildings, chimneys and people
is cloaked in a dullish, londonish hue.

from beam to beam at the sound of the bell.

old vessels and heroes – all resurrected!

the river glints thickly, the workwomen hurry;
and a black school of herculean fishwives
bursts out of nowhere, joking, laughing.
wagging sumptuous hips they come!

and some, in the baskets on their heads,
rock sons who’ll one day drown in storms.

returning soldiers look sombre as ghosts;
a gleaming palace stands opposite a hovel.
mounted patrolmen set out from the archways

range through the capital, now turning cold.

ladies so white in the lamp-lit distance,
leaning and smiling at jewellers’ windows.

the master carpenters jump from beam to beam.

I wander off, wondering, through gorges, through alleys,
or wander along the quays where boats are moored.

Camões fights in the south, saving a book by swimming!
Superb ships sail that I will never see!

and the taverns, the cafés, the tents, the stalls
spread out their white reflections like a sheet;
and the moon reminds me of the circus and juggling games.
two churches, in a long-missed square,
cast the black and funereal stain of the clergy:
in them I see a severe inquisitorial wasteland,
so that I venture and expand through history.
in the part that was destroyed by the earthquake,
the straight, equal, tall buildings wall me up;
I am confronted, in the rest, by the steep climbs,
and the bells of a monastic and devout ringing.

with courtship benches and small pepper trees,
bronze, monumental, of warlike proportions,
an epic of old rises, on a pillar!

somber and spectral, the soldiers gather;
a palace catches fire opposite a hovel.

they startle me;
they have trouble raising their tall necks
and many of them are accomplices or chorus girls.

quem quer que lhe tivesse concebido os ossos, era então visível o objectivo de os fazer florir. deles brotaria a pele, o céu, a encenação da glória. tudo isso mais não eram, entretanto, do que imagens em apuros, imagens atacadas por memórias em conflito com o presente, ou mesmo com o passado onde pareciam radicar, e que, esbeiçando-se nos bordos, davam lugar a que o esquecimento sobre elas actuasse como uma espécie de ácido sulfúrico.
de cada vez que o invadia, a enxurrada da memória ascendia-lhe assim a um tal nível da consciência que os seus próprios ossos, deixando de ser pontos fixos e estáveis aos quais ele se pudesse segurar, vinham, desmantelados, boiar à superfície das águas borrascosas, de mistura
com entranhas donde só a alma parecia não se ter desalojado ainda, como que as inflando e

But it's no use, she's not jealous, she herself pushes me into the arms of the world. She's so demanding, so snobbish, so stubborn. For her, there were no Sundays or holidays, no summer. My whole life was always a dark room with B-grade movies and a soundtrack of gunshots, sobs, and laughter from an anatomical theater. She sets me up for duels – she's crazy! – with fearsome swordsmen, at the sight of whom my soul trembles from head to toe. She says it's good for me to bleed a little, that she's my friend, maybe. Cold, severe, calculating, she tries everything she can to counteract my noisy, patient, sentimental nature. she says it's rubbish
to write with tears, she recites
mallarmé, she gets up at night
to tear up my poems.
it's not easy to put up with her.
just to irritate me, she changes
the name of everything:
if she sees a massacre she calls it
an acre of plowed land,
she sees a beggar she calls it

"sobre o desconcerto do mundo (excerpt)
quem tão baixa tivesse a fantasia
que nunca em mores cousas a metesse
que em só levar seu gado à fonte fria
e mungir-lhe o leite que bebesse!
quão bem-aventurado que seria!
que, por mais que fortuna revolvesse,
nunca em si sentiria maior pena
que pesar-lhe da vida ser pequena.
veria erguer do sol a roxa face,
veria correr sempre a clara fonte,
sem imaginar a água donde nace,
nem quem a luz esconde no horizonte.
tangendo a frauta donde o gado pace,
conheceria as ervas do alto monte;
em deus creria, simples e quieto,
sem mais especular nenhum secreto.
de um certo trasilau se lê e escreve,
entre as cousas da velha antiguidade,
que perdido um grão tempo o siso teve
por causa dũa grande infirmidade;
e enquanto, de si fora, doudo esteve,
tinha por teima e cria por verdade,
que eram suas as naus que navegavam,
quantas no porto píreo ancoravam.
por um senhor mui grande se teria
(além da vida alegre que passava),
pois nas que se perdiam não perdia,
e das que vinham salvas se alegrava.
não tardou muito tempo quando, um dia,
um crito, seu irmão, que ausente estava,
à terra chega; e vendo o irmão perdido,
do fraternal amor foi comovido.
aos médicos o entrega, e com aviso
o faz estar à cura refusada.
triste, que por tornar-lhe o caro siso
lhe tira a doce vida descansada!

o tornam à saúde atrás passada.

agradece a vontade, a obra não.
porque, despois de ver-se no perigo
dos trabalhos que o siso lhe obrigava,
e despois de não ver o estado antigo
que a vã opinião lhe apresentava,
—ó inimigo irmão, com cor d’amigo!
para que me tiraste (suspirava)
da mais quieta vida e livre em tudo
que nunca pôde ter nenhum sesudo?
por que rei, por que duque me trocara?
por que senhor de grande fortaleza?
que me dava que o mundo se acabara,
ou que a ordem mudasse a natureza?
agora é-me pesada a vida cara;
sei que cousa é trabalho e que tristeza.

que na doudice só consiste o siso.","on the world\'s chaos and confusion (excerpt)
happy the man who never places
his small and humble fantasy
in anything greater than simply leading
his cattle to drink from the cold spring
and drawing their milk so that he can drink!
however fortune may stir things up,
he’ll never feel any greater grief
than the weight of knowing his life is brief.
he’ll see the rising sun’s red face
and see the clear spring always flowing,
not wondering where the water comes from
nor who on the horizon hides the light.
playing the flute where his cattle graze,
he’ll know the grass that covers the hill;
in god he’ll simply and calmly believe,
not pondering truths he can’t conceive.
among the things of antiquity,
it’s written of a certain thrasyllus
that, due to a grave infirmity,
he lost his senses for a long season,
during which time, bereft of reason,
he claimed and believed that all the ships
which at the port of piraeus landed
were ships he owned if not commanded.
he took himself for a mighty lord
and enjoyed as well a happy life,
since he lost nothing when ships were lost,
and rejoiced for those that landed safely.
time went by till one day crito
his brother returned after a long absence
and, seeing how thrasyllus had lost his wits,
was moved by fraternal love to pity.
he gave him to doctors, charging them
to perform the cure thus far refused.
alas! by restoring his brother’s senses,
he robbed him of his sweet easy life!
the herbs of apollo, without delay,
gave him back his former health.
now of sound mind, thrasyllus thanked
his brother for caring, not for his act.
for when he saw himself in danger
of the toils that sanity would impose
and saw no more that state of privilege
conferred on him by his fantasy,
he sighed: “o enemy brother, pretended
friend, why did you take from me
that life so calm and free of pains,
which can’t be had by anyone sane?
“what king, or duke or mighty lord
would i have wished to trade places with?
what did i care if the world ended
or if nature’s order suddenly changed?
now dear life is a heavy burden,
for i know what toil and sadness are.
restore me to that state of bliss;
the only sane condition is madness.”",pt_XX,en_XX,"on the world's confusion (excerpt)
whoever had such a low imagination
that he would never put it into anything else
than just taking his cattle to the cold spring
and milking them to drink!
how blessed he would be!
who, no matter how much fortune turned,
would never feel greater sorrow
than the regret that his life was short.
he would see the sun rise the purple face,
he would see the clear spring always run,
without imagining the water from which it springs,
nor who the light hides on the horizon.
playing the flute from which the cattle pace,
he would know the grasses of the high mountain;
he would believe in God, simple and quiet,
without further speculating on any secret.
of a certain Thrasylaus it is read and written,
among the things of ancient antiquity,
that his wisdom lost a great deal of time
because of great infirmity; and while he was out of his mind, he was stubborn and believed to be true, that the ships that were sailing were his, as many as were anchored in the Pyrenean port. he would have been a great master (in addition to the happy life he was living), because he did not lose in those that were lost, and he was happy with those that were saved. It was not long before, one day, a Christian, his brother, who was absent, arrived on land; and seeing his brother lost, he was moved by fraternal love. He handed him over to the doctors, and with a warning, he had him refused a cure. sad, that by restoring his dear sense, he took away his sweet and peaceful life! the Apollonian herbs, suddenly, restored him to his former health. wise, Thrasylaus thanked his dear brother for his will, but not for his work. because, after seeing himself in danger
of the work that his sense of sense forced him to do,
and after not seeing the old state
that his vain opinion presented to him,
—oh, brother enemy, with the color of a friend!
why did you take me (he sighed)
from the most peaceful and free life in everything
that no sensible person could ever have?
For what king, for what duke did I exchange?
For what lord of a great fortress?
What did it matter to me that the world had ended,
or that order changed nature?
Now my dear life is heavy for me;
I know what work is and what sadness.

that foolishness consists only of sense.",0

do alto das muralhas de ohrid onde
acorrera aos gritos desvairados dos vigias,
o rei samuel avistou o seu exército desfigurado,
arrastando-se entre as montanhas da macedónia.
aos catorze mil homens tinham sido
arrancados os olhos por ordem do imperador
e a um em cada cem mandara ele, basílio ii,
fosse poupado um olho para conduzirem o regresso
dessa manada cega. depois de atravessarem altas neves
vinham-se agora despenhando para o lago,
tropeçando, agarrados uns aos outros,
a tortura espelhada nas contorções das faces,
o sangue a empapar-lhes os andrajos. e o rei,
tomado pela angústia, deu um grito de dor e morreu
no alto da muralha sobre a colina e os seus bosques e pomares
que o lago placidamente reflectia.
nesse instante compreendeu como era ambígua
a força cega do destino e em nenhum mosteiro
podia a iconostase explicar-lhe esse cruel mistério:
os santos, com feições dos retratos do fayoum,
entre as chamas trémulas emudeciam
nos seus frescos e as vozes dos jovens monges,
no seu canto austero e imperturbado,
elevavam uma grave primavera na penumbra.","the road to ohrid*
from the heights of the walls of ohrid
to where he’d run upon hearing the screams
of the look-outs, king samuel beheld his disfigured
army dragging through the macedonian mountains.
the eyes of the fourteen thousand men had been
gouged by order of the emperor, basil the second,
who had instructed that one eye be spared in every
hundredth man so that they could lead the return
of that blind herd. having crossed over the high snows
they now came rushing down toward the lake,
stumbling and grabbing on to one another,
the torture mirrored in their facial contortions,
blood soaking their tattered clothes, and the king,
seized by anguish, uttered a shout of grief and died
on the heights of the walls over the hill and his forests and groves
which the lake so peacefully reflected.
in that instant he understood just how ambiguous
the blind force of destiny was, and in no monastery
could the screens of icons have elucidated that cruel mystery:
the saints, whose faces resembled fayumic portraits,
remained silent in their frescos amid the flickering
flames, and the voices of the young monks,
in their austere and unyielding chant,
were lifting up a grave spring in the shadows.",pt_XX,en_XX,"the road to ohrid*

tantas vezes se vive de uma arrebatada
noção dos contrastes mais fortes entre o bem e o
mal, entre a grandeza e a abjecção, entre as rápidas
peripécias de um heroísmo ansioso e o destino inexorável,
que o melodrama é da nossa mais funda natureza,
nostálgica, obscuramente nostálgica do coração radical,
do que vai à desfilada nos sonhos contraditórios,
do que engendra imagens capciosas e julga viver em liberdade,

nas malhas deste mundo, nos imprevistos
da traição e da morte, ou tem de renunciar perante os rasgos
mais sublimes. a paixão dilacera bruscamente as personagens
apegadas à felicidade, os obstáculos
também têm protagonistas, ajustes de contas, cruéis fulgores,
perseguições, e nos casos desvairados de amor não há saída.
desse falhanço insuportável nasce o melodrama,
lírico, incontido, entre golfadas de espiral vertiginosa
com o sangue e a memória, com o que não tem remédio e a música trágica,
em que alguém vai morrer, alguém se perde alucinado,
e alguém se salva e porventura alguém escreve

"o jogo do chinquilho
renasce neste largo a minha infância
a minha vida tem aqui nova nascente
e jorra de repente com o ímpeto do início
o tempo não passou ou só a consciência
que provisoriamente sinto de voltar alguns anos atrás

de ser um espectador de sucessivos sucedidos dias
de não viver apenas não viver sem sequer saber que vivo
num espaço demarcado onde as coisas e os homens
eram tanto que eram simplesmente

de boné ou barrete na cabeça e mãos nos bolsos

como se aqui ninguém houvesse envelhecido
nem sofrido ou morrido ou suportado
toda a imensa fome requerida para produzir um rico
como se aqui ninguém tivesse demandado
longe de aqui o seu país noutros países
tudo é o mesmo adro a mesma tarde o mesmo jogo
até este café onde sentado olho e penso por olhar
é afinal o mesmo onde bebi a meias com meu pai
a primeira cerveja uma cerveja vinda
através do calor do dia de verão
nesse cesto de vime nesse poço mergulhado
é o mesmo o sabor que sempre sinto nesta boca
há muitos anos já mordendo o vinho o pão a vida
o sabor das mulheres das raparigas
inacessíveis sempre como um absoluto
sempre impossível tido no entanto por possível
o sabor da derrota ou o sabor da terra
sensível dia a dia nos meus dedos
e um dia susceptível de me encher a boca para sempre
envelheci eu sei e só ganhei
o que perdi. sou de uma adulta idade
e entretanto tudo a noite rodeou e o jogo acabou
e pelo céu do tempo houve um homem que passou

in this square my childhood resurrects

evidently were because they simply were

quoit tossed by someone through the space of the day
and ready to fall into the sea as onto a stake

the quoit as if in that act life itself were at stake

with caps on their heads and hands in their pockets
it all happened it happens here thirty-five years ago
as if here no one had gotten old
or suffered or died or endured
the enormous hunger needed to produce one rich man
as if no one here had gone in search of his country
in countries far far away from here
it’s the very same churchyard same afternoon same quoits
even this café where i sit watching and watch with my thinking
is the same café where i split my first beer
with my father a beer that resisted
the heat of the summer day
in that wicker basket submerged in that well
it’s the same taste i’ve had in my mouth
for many years now chewing wine and bread and life
the taste of women the taste of girls
forever inaccessible like any absolute
forever impossible yet pursued as if possible
the taste of defeat or the taste of palpable
earth day by day running through my fingers
and one day bound to fill my mouth forever
i’ve aged i know and all i’ve gained
is what i lost. i’m a grown-up now.

"meditação sobre ruínas
desembarcou numa sala sem dourados nem cadeiras:
madeiras velhas, jarras com flores de plástico, janelas
de vidros partidos para a auto-estrada. nem vento,
nem mar: só o ruído dos carros entrava pelas fendas
para ecoar no tecto (madeiras à vista entre os restos
de estuque). depois, na rua, pendurou-se nos ferros podres
de antigas varandas. percebia-se, por entre os arbustos
que invadiam tudo, uma vista que teria sido digna
de um quadro romântico. o vale, coberto de casas, e
os montes invadidos por ferro-velho, ocultam um passado
de rebanhos e pastores. mas talvez não se tenha ouvido aqui
a música da flauta. com efeito, esta casa limita-se
a guardar antigos silêncios, que o uso transformou em manchas
sépia na memória. agora, confundem-se com a cor das paredes;
e só abrigam tocas répteis, que apenas se adivinham,
no inverno, escondidos do universo. mas alguém passou por aqui,
há pouco; e um monte de madeira fumega, ainda, enquanto
o sol avança a partir do nascente, onde as cores frias
da madrugada não se dissipam, nem pássaro algum saúda

whose broken panes looked out onto the highway. no wind,
no sea: only the sound of cars entering through the cracks

remains). outside he hung on to the rusted rails
of decrepit balconies. he discerned, through the underbrush
that was overrunning everything, a landscape worthy
of a romantic painting. the houses covering the valley and
the hills taken over by scrap iron hide a past
with flocks and shepherds. but perhaps the flute’s song
was never heard here. indeed, this house conserves nothing
but ancient silences, which the using has transformed into sepia
spots in memory. now they’re blended into the colour of the walls
and harbour only dens of scarcely discernible reptiles,
in winter, hidden from the universe. but someone was here

the solitude he’d inherited from night. he entered

a shadow’s cold; he saw absence distil

of spring.

girl, something went wrong. he didn’t set
