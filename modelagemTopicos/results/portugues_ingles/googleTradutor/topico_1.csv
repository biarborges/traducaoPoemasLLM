[sobre a fotografia de uma criança encontrada morta numa praia da turquia]
o meu pai chamou-me e pediu-me que escolhesse
um brinquedo – só um – de que gostasse muito; e
que separasse outro brinquedo para o aylan, que
ainda não sabia escolher, mas só um, e tinha de
ser pequeno. o meu pai explicou-me que nessa
noite ia fazer de tudo quase nada numa trouxa
leve; porque assim, quando o aylan e eu caíssemos
de sono, ele e a minha mãe poderiam levar-nos ao
colo sem ficarem para trás. havia lágrimas nos olhos
do meu pai quando contou que, na manhã seguinte,
teríamos de deixar a nossa terra; mas logo se
recompôs, dizendo que kobanî também já não era
bem a nossa terra, que a nossa casa era a ruína da
nossa casa, que toda a síria não passava de um tímpano
exausto de tanto estrondo e dois olhos cansados,
mas tão cansados, de chamas e de sangue. o meu pai
achava que o aylan era demasiado pequeno para
compreender e, por isso, dissera-lhe apenas que
iríamos dar um passeio de barco, que passaríamos
o dia numa praia e que, enquanto eu e a minha mãe
nadássemos no mar até ficarmos sem fôlego, ele
podia simplesmente deitar-se de bruços na areia,
como tanto gostava. o meu pai nunca nos mentiu.","lungs

to pick out another toy for aylan, who
was still too young to choose, but just one, and
it had to be small. my father told me that
tonight he’d wrap up our things in a light
bundle; this way, once aylan and i fell
asleep, he and my mother could carry us
without staying behind. there were tears in my father’s
eyes when he said that, tomorrow morning,
we’d have to leave our land; but he quickly
pulled it together, saying kobanî wasn’t really
our land anymore, that our home was the ruins
of our home, that all of syria was nothing but an eardrum
exhausted from all the noise and two eyes, tired,
so tired, of seeing flames and blood. my father
thought aylan was too little to
understand, so he just told him that
we were going on a boat ride, that we’d spend

enevoada em suas ligaduras
e tubos nas narinas e nas mãos
que se agitavam e tudo era metálico,
mas ela, a retalhada,
era só tempo incerto, interrogado e trôpego,
só gemido sem voz quando o homem ansioso
se debruçava na contagem dos segundos,
mas ela, a gotejante,
era um puro intervalo numa frouxa fronteira,
só um peso de pálpebras e noite espessa, quando ele, debruçado,
murmurava as palavras, as que ela não ouvia.
terminada a visita, um olhar de relance, um último
desse dia, cercou-a de silêncios pensativos.
a interrogação, a negação da esperança, são como a rosa negra
das condições da esperança.
despiu a bata branca obrigatória, foi-se devagar
e guardou-lhe o rosto translúcido envolto em gazes leves.
há quanto tempo foi? em que lugar, em que manhã furtiva da memória?
quem era o homem? que palavras proferia?
hoje não sei. é como ver da rua uma figura entre cortinas
numa corrente de ar, às vezes penso que era eu,
mas pergunto também, seria alguém por mim, numa curva do tempo,
a murmurar tão baixo palavras esquecidas?
mas se não era eu, como é que soube dessa voz comovida
a resvalar assim até ser inaudível
fora do coração? e se era eu, como pude
tão de dentro falar, tão apagadamente?
porque eu procuro outros andamentos do mundo,
outros nós na garganta, mais pensados a frio, outras intensidades
sacudidas, mais distantes da emoção imediata,
e nunca mais diria palavras tão obscuras.
não interessa quem era. os mares, os ventos
rolaram e rodaram e foram erodindo verdades, circunstâncias.

a woman lay in intensive care
in a fog of bandages with tubes
entering her nostrils and hands,
which twitched, and it was all metallic,
but she, the cut and punctured,
was just a question of tottering, uncertain time,
just a voiceless moan when the troubled man
leaned over in the countdown of seconds,
but she, the dripper,
was a pure interlude on a weak frontier,
just the weight of eyelids and thick night, when he, leaning over,
murmured the words she didn’t hear.

of that day, wrapped her in pensive silences.

through wind-blown curtains. sometimes i think it was me,
but i also wonder if someone in my stead, in a fold of time,
might have so softly murmured the forgotten words.
but if it wasn’t me, how did i know about that choked voice
that kept slipping until it could no longer be heard
outside the heart? and if it was me, how could i
have spoken so inwardly, in such a muffled tone?

more coldly considered knots in the throat, other trembling
intensities, more detached from immediate emotion,
