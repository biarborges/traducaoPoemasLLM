"uma canção póstuma para paul celan
onde vieres também tu a sussurrar nas valas, nem que faminta esteja a tua voz

até nas ondas do meio-dia, na linha calma das cerejas, se te vejo, margarete — eu « escureço — «e escureço
como o cabelo com o tom escuro dos violinos me escurece, como
escurece o vento nos bosques frios em que morremos, escurecem as alamedas
escurece o leite negro que bebemos e bebemos.
onde vieres também tu pelo adordo sublime do infortúnio, nem que franzido seja o teu sangue
e se teus lábios os vir ao entardecer, à hora mágica, lendo os poemas da galícia — eu regresso — «eu
até nos combóios que cavam um túmulo pelos ares, se te vejo, sulamith — eu «escureço — «e escureço
como o entardecer nas horas mais pequenas me escurece, como
escurecem as rugas pelos rostos, escurecem os poemas

where you too will come sighing in the ditches, even if yours is a famished voice
and if i see your eyes at dawn, lost over the fields, in shuddering places — i will return — «i
even on the waves of midday, along the contour of a cherry, if i see you, margarete — i « darken — «and darken
as the hair of dark-coloured violins darkens me, as
the wind darkens in the cold woods where we die, the alleys darken
the black milk we drink and drink darkens.
whence you too will appear with the sublime finery of misfortune, even if your blood will curdle
and if in the evening, at the magic hour, i can glimpse your eyes reading galicia’s poems — i will return — «i
even on the trains digging a tunnel through the air, if i see you, sulamith — i «darken — «and i darken

"carta ao pai
agora que o senhor
mais assemelha pedaço
de carne com dois olhos
dirigidos ao teto escuro
no leito em que provável
só não há-de morrer só
porque nem a própria
saliva poderá engolir
por si na companhia
somente desta sonda
que o alimenta

em validade a proibição
da mãe em confessar
ao senhor os hábitos
amorosos das mucosas
que são minhas
e se deveras me amaria
tanto menos soubesse
quanta fricção já tiveram
que não lhes cabia
biológica ou religiosa
-mente e se também
pediria para sua filhoa
a morte que desejou
a tantos de minha laia
quando surgiam na tela
da glboo da record
da manchete do sbt
que sempre constituíram
seu cordão umbilical
com a tradição
e se deveras faria
sobrevir a eles
grande destruição
pela violência
com que urrava
seus xingamentos
típicos de macho
nascido no interior
desse pais de machos
interiores e quebrados
em seus orgulhos falhos
de crer que o pai
é o que abarrota
geladeiras e não deixa
que falte à mesa
o alimento que nutre
as mesmas mucosas
em que corre
o seu sangre
mas não seu deus
e ora neste leito partido
o cérebro em veias
como riachos insistentes
em correr
fora das margens
se o senhor
soubesse o dolo
com que manchei
a mesa
de todos os patriarcas
ainda pergunto-me
se me receberia
com a mansidão
que aceita na testa
o beijo desta sua filhoa
que nada mais é
que a sua imagem
e semelhança invertidas
tal espelho
que refletisse opostos
de gênero e religião
ou o desenho
animado na infância
de uma sala de justiça
onde numa tela
podia-se observar
um mundo ao avesso
e se o pai e o pai
odeiam deveras
o gerado nas normas
da biologia e religião
mais tarde porém geridos
na transgressão das leis
que o pai e o pai
impõem-nos na ciência
de sermos todos falhos
nessa terra onde procriar
é tão frequente
que gere prazer
nenhum e olho
o senhor
com essas pupilas
que talvez jamais
reflitam o pai
mas ora veem o pai
eu
mesmo pedaço
de carne
com dois olhos
peço perdão
em silêncio
pois sequer posso
dizer que não
mais há tempo
e mesmo assim
e porém
e no entanto
e contudo
pelo medo adversativo
de talvez abalar

de alicerces
sob a casa

uma vez mais
o silêncio","letter to the father
now that my lord
more closely resembles a hunk
of meat with two eyes
turned toward the dark ceiling
from the gurney where likely
you will not die alone
only because not even able
to swallow your saliva
yourself in the company
of this tube alone
that feeds you
i ask myself
if mother's ban
against confessing
to my lord the amorous habits
of my mucous membranes
is still in place
and if indeed you would love me
the less you knew about
how much rubbing they'd already had
that did not befit them
biological or religious
-ly and also if
you would want for your boyess
the death you wished
on so many of my kind
when they appeared on screen
on globo record
manchete or sbt
which always constituted
your umbilical connection
to tradition
and if indeed you would
make come upon them
great destruction
by the violence
of your raging slurs
typical of a macho man
born in a remote town
in this country of machos
remote and broken
in their false pride
believing that a father
is he who crams
refrigerators full and does
not let the table want for
food to nourish
the same mucous membranes
in which your blood
but not your god
runs thick
and now in this broken gurney
your brain all veins
like rivulets bent on
running
outside the lines
if my lord
knew how
i'd stained the patriarchs'
table with deceit
i still ask myself
if you would welcome
me as meekly
as you accept a kiss
on the forehead from
your boyess
who is nothing more
than your own image
and likeness inverted
a mirror such
as reflects opposites
of gender and religion
or the cartoon
from my childhood
of a hall of justice
where on a screen
you could watch a world gone wrong
and if the father and father
indeed scorn
one created by the norms
of biology and religion
yet later corrected
after flaunting the laws
the father and the father
impose on us in the science
of being all of us flawed
on this earth where procreating
is so common
it brings pleasure
not at all and i look at
my lord
with these pupils
that maybe never
reflect the father
but now see the father
i
also a hunk
of meat
with two eyes
ask forgiveness
in silence

say there is no more time
and nevertheless
and even still

and yet
for conflicted fear
of possibly shaking
a rudimentary system
of foundation
holding up this house
holding up this room
holding up this borrowed
hospital

i once again
choose
silence",pt_XX,en_XX,"Letter to Father
Now that you are
More akin to a piece
Of meat with two eyes
Directed at the dark ceiling
In the bed where it's likely
You won't die alone
Because not even your own
Saliva you can swallow
In the company solely
Of this tube
That feeds you
I wonder if the prohibition
Of mother in confessing
To you the amorous habits
Of the mucous membranes
That are mine
And whether you would love me
Even less knowing
How much friction they've had
Which isn't biologically or religiously
-ly and if she too
Would ask for your death
Which you wished for so many of my kind
When they appeared on the screen
Of glboo's highlight reel
Of the sbt's headline
Which always constituted
Your umbilical cord
With tradition
And whether indeed
You would bring upon them
Great destruction
Through the violence
With which you roared
Your typical male insults
Born in the interior
Of this country of broken
Inwardly proud men
Who believe that a father
Is one who stocks
Refrigerators and doesn't let
The table lack the food
That nourishes
The same mucous membranes
In which runs
Your blood
But not your god
And now in this broken bed
The brain in veins
Like streams insistently
Running
Outside the banks
If you
Knew the deceit
With which I've stained
The table
Of all patriarchs
I still wonder
If you would receive me
With the meekness
That accepts on the forehead
The kiss of this your daughter
Who is nothing more
Than your image
And likeness reversed
Like a mirror
That reflects opposites
Of gender and religion
Or the animated series
Of childhood
From a courtroom
Where on a screen
One could observe
A world turned upside down
And if the father and the father
Really hate the one generated
Under the laws of biology and religion
But later governed
By the transgression of the laws
That father and father
Impose upon us in the knowledge
That we are all flawed
In this land where procreation
Is so frequent
That it brings no pleasure
And I look at you
With these pupils
That perhaps will never
Reflect the father
But now see the father
I myself
Piece of meat
With two eyes
Ask for forgiveness
In silence
For I can barely
Say that I don't
There is still time
And even so
And yet
And however
And despite
Because of the adversative fear
Of perhaps shaking
A rudimentary system
Of foundations
Below the house
Below the room
Below this borrowed
Hospital bed

"a viagem de alexandre à índia
andaste de um ao outro lado da terra na vida interminável,
tiveste degredos, piedosos cíumes, a fé desvanescida,
amantes paradas na lavoura, roubando-te o rosto amado.
viste vestígios de que foste a sombra de ninguém,
olhos sem pudor, do reflexo dos ferros no tropel,
franjas do domínio pueril de alexandre, olhando gaugamela.
partiste num porto de transição para o levante,
com vazios para trás, todo o tempo a poder ver,
e ao primeiro inverno, pelos cardeais das suas cinzas,
começaste a travessia que não termina, a história que não acaba.
soubeste porque se vislumbra, em lágrimas, o pinheiro da juventude,
o nome quebrado num turvo ar medido sem corda,
e a maresia do vento de feição no segundo inverno.
em troca perseguiste o que rege o homem fortuito,
segredando em palácios de mármore que são apenas pedras,
dos fracassos a que jamais alguém ajoelhara.
ao terceiro inverno descobriste o hemisfério, e ao quarto,
sem ideia de guerra ou ordem para mudar o reino,
escolheste adornar os aquedutos sob o manto dos regatos,
sentado, na brisa no tanque, ao febril entardecer.
de quem te aproximaste, no seu trajecto interminado,
sem lugar senão o que esfria na mente recortada,
naquilo que se ramifica, tornando-se na própria teia,
contigo propagou o dever de passar em toda a parte.
e quando veio o quinto inverno, e o sexto, suturaste o sangue,
trouxeste a pele à curva dos rios, acolheste o que de resto se desmorona,
e pudeste enfim, na crença dos migradores furtivos, entender que
tudo se perde noutro lugar ainda, e após esse ainda noutro
e que ao fim de cada manhã noutra manhã
tudo é incerto, tão conforme o dente-de-leão no meio de searas,
tão emudecido como a veia exausta dos não sepultados.
na mansarda onde vagueia o dia e a noite
o vento responde, cortando o centeio e o calcário, e a vela
que brilha na luz de estrelas veladas, já desaparecidas,
pisadas, mudas, engolidas aos pés do sétimo inverno,
arpoa o coração e a ruína — os meridianos despem-se, voam
em vinte e cinco anos que há pouco se beijavam, e seja dito ou não dito
o prazer que inflige um pico de tormentos
por lábios que só as mulheres conhecem
no moinho das águas da morte em varanasi,
sacode a chama de quanto vale, dura e canta
o princípio e o fim do teu poder na terra.","alexandres`s travel to india
you wandered an interminable life across the earth,
suffered exile, piteous jealousy, futile faith,
labour-arrested lovers plundering your beloved’s face.
you saw traces of having been no one’s shadow,
impudent eyes, the reflection of iron on the rampage,
hints of alexander’s puerile dominance, contemplating gaugamela.
you set off from a transient port towards the levant,
leaving emptiness behind, seeing all of time,
and in the first winter, by the cardinals of its ashes,
you started the endless crossing, the incessant history.
you knew, because the pine tree of youth can be glimpsed through tears,
of the shattered name in a cloudy mood measured without ropes,
and of the favourable sea breeze in the second winter.
in exchange you pursued that which rules the fortuitous man,
whispering in marble palaces that are but stones,
failures to which no one had ever knelt.
by the third winter you discovered the hemisphere, and by the fourth,
non intent on war or order to change the kingdom,
you chose to adorn aqueducts with the mantle of streams,
sitting by the pool breeze, in the evening´s lingering fever.
whomever you approached, in their indefinite path,
without a place except that which fades inside a patchy mind,
in that which branches out and becomes the very web,
has spread with you the duty to pass through everywhere.
and by the fifth winter, and the sixth, you stitched up the blood,
brought the skin on to the river bends, welcomed that which falls apart,
and were at last capable, with the belief of a stealthy migrant, of understanding
that all is lost yet in another place, and after this in yet another
and that by the end of each morning in another morning
all is uncertain, just like a dandelion in a field of wheat,
as muted as the exhausted vein of the unburied.
in the attic where night and day roam
the wind replies, cutting the chalk and the rye, and the candle,
shimmering in the light of the veiled stars already gone,
trodden, voiceless, swallowed up by the seventh winter,
spears the heart and the ruin — the meridians undress, fly away
in twenty five years that were just kissing yesterday, and be it told or untold
the pleasure that brings a peak of torment, inflicted
by lips that only women know
in the turmoil of varanasi´s death waters,
tests the flame of the merit, endurance and song of
the beginning and the end of your power on earth.",pt_XX,en_XX,"The journey of alexander to india

eyes without shame, the reflection of the iron in the rush,
fringes of the petty realm of alexander, watching gaugamela.

i’m thinking of you, dear girl,
your mother’s memory haunts me.
my eyes fill up with tears,
they are bathing you gently.
you were born amid sorrow—
may it yet prove a blessing.
since fortune, struck with envy,
singled you out at birth.
gone forever was contentment,
you heard no joyful voices.
your mother’s life had ended,
while ours went on in sadness.
in anguish born and raised!
i don’t know where all this is going.
i’ve watched you grow, my girl,
with green eyes so lovely.
beauty like yours wasn’t meant
to be born in exile. curses on
fate! this was clearly a work
of malevolence, not a mistake.
here lies your mother,
and we languish in grief.
you did nothing, my girl,
to incur a loss so great.
the fates spurn reason,
and will admit no protest.
i pity your poor father,
for the pain he must lament.
i heard you crying, alone,
before anyone else. you’d not
be here, had i not been there.
still, i ask if i did right.
but surely it can’t be wrong
for you to have been born
with that elegant smile of yours,
those dazzling green eyes.
it’s an unlikely comfort
that i take for myself.
may god grant you the grace
that has eluded you till now.
beauty and good fortune,
or so the old story goes,
were once the best of friends,
but became bitterly opposed.
many hold that it’s fantasy,
but in my life i’ve seen
enough not to doubt it:
fate inflicts great damage.
no harm is ever believed;
we always expect the good.

lies an element of change,
an element of concern.",pt_XX,en_XX,"Of the girl and maiden

Contentment was dead
No joy you heard,
Your mother was deceased,
We others were sad:
Nothing in pain in pain grown
I don't know where this will lead
I see you daughter beautiful
With green eyes grow:
This grace was not yours
To be born in exile
May disaster be cursed
Which put more into this than error:
Here was her burial
Your mother and sorrow to us
You were not daughter not
To die for you:
There was no reason in fate
Nor is praying allowed
I have much pity for your father
Who will complain of himself:
I heard only you
First before anyone else
You weren't his, nor was anyone else
I don't know if I did wrong or right:
But it cannot be mistress
For no evil to be born
With this gracious smile
That you have over green eyes:
More dubious comfort
This is what I take thus
God give you better fortune
Than you have had until now:
That happiness and beauty
They say old tales
That fought one day
Being once very friendly:
Many believe it's fantasy
I who have seen times and years
I doubt nothing
As it is a case of harm:
But no evil is believed
Good is only expected
And in belief and hope
In both there is change
In both there is care",0

"a morte em parcelas
a francisco bley
a primeira vez que eu morri,
gaguejei ao amigo se se sobrevive

em mortandade, respondeu: sim,
se sobrevive, se atravessa o quarto
em chamas e se emerge no jardim,
chamuscado, a musselina pegada
à pele, a própria pele qual musselina,
mas vivo, ainda, ainda mais para cá
do que para o além, quando hemos
de estar não só alfabetizados
mas psiomeguizados nesse vocabulário
das perdas crescentes como as dívidas.
isso, isto deveria servir de consolo,
como volta a primavera de perséfone
em férias no submundo, e voltam peixes
a rios devastados, e as baleias a mares
de plástico, e até o sol volta ao ártico
após uma noite que dura meses.
ainda que se sinta isso como castigo.

toda a terra foi perdida
no campo do tejo só
achava o gado guarida
ver alentejo era um dó:
e jano, pera salvar
o gado que lhe ficou,
foi esta terra buscar,
e um cuidado levou,
outro foi ele lá achar
o dia que ali chegou
com seu gado e com seu fato
com tudo se agasalhou
em uma bicada de um mato:
e levando-o a pascer
o outro dia à ribeira

que andava pela ribeira
do tejo: a flores colher
vestido branco trazia
um pouco afrontada andava
fermosa bem parecia
aos olhos de quem na olhava:
jano em vendo-a foi pasmado
mas por ver que ela fazia
escondeu-se antre um prado:
joana flores colhia
jano colhia cuidado
despois que ela teve as flores
já colhidas e escolhidas,
as desvariadas cores
com rosas entremetidas:
fez delas uma capela
e soltou os seus cabelos
que eram tão longos como ela
e de cada um a jano em vê-los
lhe nascia uma querela
e em quanto aquisto fazia
joana: o seu gado andava
por dentro da água fria
todo após quem o guiava:
dum pato grande era guia
e todo junto em carreira
ora rio acima ia,
ora, na mesma maneira
o rio abaixo descia
joana como assentou
a capela: foi com a mão
à cabeça, e atentou
se estava em boa feição:
não ficando satisfeita
do que da mão presumia
partiu-se dali direita
para onde o rio fazia
d’água: uma mansa, colheita
chegando à beira do rio,
as patas logo vieram
todas uma e uma, em fio,
que toda a água moveram:
de quanto ela já folgou
com aquestes gasalhados
tanto entonces lhe pesou
e com pedras e com brados
d’ali longe as enxotou
depois que elas foram idas
e que a água assossegou
joana as abas erguidas
entrar pel’água ordenou,
e assentando-se então
as çapatas descalçou
e pondo-as sobre o chão
por dentro d’água entrou
e a jano polo coração
em quanto com passos quedos
joana pela água ia
antre uns desejos e medos
jano onde estava ardia:
não sabia se falasse
se saísse, se estivesse
que o amor mandava que ousasse
e por que a não perdesse
fazia que arreceasse
dizem que naqueste meo
se esteve joana olhando
e descobrindo o seu seo
olhou-se, e dixe um ai dando:
eu guardo patas coitada
não sei onde isto há de ir ter
mais era eu pera guardada
que concerto foi este ser
fermosa, e mal empregada
em aquisto jano ouvindo
não se pôde em si sofrer
que d’antre as ervas saindo
se não lançasse a correr:
joana quando sentiu
os estrompidos de jano
e que se virou e o viu
temor do presente dano
lhe deu pés com que fugiu
mui perto estava o casal
onde vivia o pai dela
que fez ir mais longe o mal
que jano teve de vê-la:
mas o medo que causou
joana partir-se assi
tanto as mãos lhe embaraçou
que a çapata esquerda ali
com a pressa lhe ficou
jano quando viu, e olhou
que nenhum remédio havia
pera o lugar se tornou
aonde ela n’água se via:
e vendo a çapata estar
no areal, à beira d’água
foi correndo a abraçar
tomando-a cresceu-lhe a mágoa
e começou de chorar
toda a çapata e os peitos
em lagrimas se banharam
muitos foram os respeitos
que tanto choro causaram:
encostado ao seu cajado
a çapata na outra mão
despois de um longo cuidado
de dentro do coração
começou falar cansado
jano
despojo da mais fermosa
cousa, que viram meus olhos
pera eles sois uma rosa
e pera o coração abrolhos:
çapata deixada aqui
pera mal de outro mor mal
quem te leixou, leva a mi,:
que troca tão desigual
mais pois assi é seja assim
agora hei vinte e um anos
e nunca inda ‘té agora
me acorda de sentir danos
os deste meu gado em fora:
e hoje per caso estranho
não sei em que hora aqui vim
cobrei cuidado tamanho,
que aos outros todos pôs fim
eu mesmo a mim mesmo estranho
antes que este mal viesse
que me tantos vai mostrando
que alguns cuidados tivesse
não me matavam cuidando,
agora por meus pecados
e segundo em mi vou vendo
não podem ser outros fados
meus cuidados não entendo
e moiro-me assi de cuidados
dentro de meu pensamento
há tanta contrariedade
que sento contra o que sento
vontade, e contra vontade:
estou em tanto desvairo,
que não me entendo comigo
donde esperarei repairo
que vejo grande o perigo
e muito mor o contrario
quem me trouxe a esta terra
alhea, onde guardada
me estava tamanha guerra
e a esperança levada:
comigo me estou espantado
como em tão pouco me dei
mas cuidando nisto estando,
os olhos com que outrem olhei
de mim, se estavam vingando
e por meu mal ser mor: inda
de mim tenho o agravo mor
que da minha mágoa infinda
eu fui parte e causador,
que se me não alevantara
d’antre as ervas onde estava
mais dos meus olhos gozara
e já que assi se ordenava
isto ao menos me ficara
desastres cuidava eu já,
quando eu ontem aqui cheguei
que a vós e á ventura má,
ambos acabava e errei:
triste que me parecia
que o meu gado remediado
comigo bem me haveria
e estava-me ordenado
est’outro mal que inda havia
o mal, não vos sabe a vós
quem me vos a mim causou
tristes dos meus olhos sós
que trouveram aonde estou:
olhos: acerto, lugar
ribeira mor das ribeiras
que levam as águas ao mar
vós me sereis verdadeiras

e em dizendo isto parece
trasportou-se no seu mal
e como a quem o ar falece
caiu naquele areal:
grande espaço se passou
que esteve ali sem sentido
e neste meo chegou
um pastor seu conhecido
e que dormia cuidou
franco de sandovir era
o seu nome, e buscava
uma frauta que perdera
que ele mais que a si amava:
este era aquele pastor
a quem celia muito amou
ninfa do maior primor
que em mondego se banhou
e que cantava milhor
e a frauta sua era aquela
que lhe celia dera, quando
o desterraram por ela,
chorando ele, ela chorando:
viera ele ali mora
porque achou aquelas terras
mais conformes ao cuidar
d’ambas partes cercam serras,
no meu campos para olhar
doutro tempo conhecidos
estes dous pastores eram
d’estranhas terras nascidos,
não no bem que se quiseram;
e por aquesta razão
tornou franco a lhe notar
como jazia no chão
e deu-lhe que suspeitar
o lugar e a feição
muito esteve duvidando
o que aqui franco faria
indo-se e jano deixando
o coração lhe doía:
também pera o acordar
não sabia se acertava
que jano era no lugar
novo, e arreceava
em cabo de o anojar
naquesta dúvida estando
jano estava emborcado
dixe um suspiro dando
ai cuidado, e mais cuidado:
ouvindo-lhe isto dizer
franco se ficou pasmado
e tornando-o milhor ver
de sob seu esquerdo lado
viu-lh’a çapata ter
suspeitou logo o que era,
(que era também namorado)
e no que jano dixera
se houve por certificado
naquisto jano acordou
quando viu franco estar
sem fala um pouco ficou
franco, após o saudar
falar-lhe assi começou
franco cuidava eu agora jano
que estavas em outra parte
e polo teu, aqueste ano
me pesava ir por esta arte:
dessejava ver-te aqui
quando me contava alguém
a seca grande que hai
em alentejo, e porém
não quisera eu ver-te assi
conta-me que mal foi este
que tão demudado estás
ou que houveste ou perdeste
se há remédio havê-lo-ás:
faz jano então por se erguer
não podendo de cansado
foi-lhe a mão, franco, estender
e a um freixo encostado
lhe começou responder
jano
vim a estes campos que vejo
por dar vida a este meu gado
vi acabado um desejo,
outro maior começado:
às minhas vacas dei vida
e a mim a fui tirar
a profecia é cumprida
que me pierio foi dar
vendo-me a barba pungida
autor
de pierio vai grã fama
(dixe franco) antre os pastores
todos por amigos chama
e dizem que é dado a amores,
rogo-te jano me digas
pois te ele avisou primeiro
como cobraste fadigas
que ouço que é mui verdadeiro
pera amigos e amigas
jano
tão cansado, respondeu
de um cuidado, franco, me acho
que m’agora aqui nasceu
que até na voz tenho empacho,
aos que hão de aquecer
não pode homem resistir
que o há de ser, há de ser
não se lhe pode fugir,
defender, nem esconder
mas por que franco, contigo
desabafo eu em falar
por que sei que és meu amigo
tudo te quero contar:
nem remédio nem conforto
não te hei franco de pedir
que do mal em que estou posto
não me espero de remir
senão despois que for morto
dia era de um grão vodo
que a um santo se fazia
onde ia o povo todo
por ver e por romaria,
lembra-me que andava eu então
vestido todo de novo
ao ombro um chapeirão
que pasmava todo o povo
com um cajado na mão
tomando-me pelo braço
pierio, então me levou
d’ali um grande pedaço
onde milhor sombra achou:
e mandando-me assentar
ele também se assentou
e antes de começar
pera mim um pouco olhou
e a voltas de chorar
pierio
vejo-te (me dixe) jano,
dos bens do mundo abastado
mas contando ano e ano
fico de todo cortado:
vejo-te lá pela idade
de nuve negra cercado
vejo-te sem liberdade
de tua terra desterrado
e mais de tua vontade
em terra que inda não viste,
pelo que nela hás de ver,
vejo-te o coração triste
pera em dias que viver,
hás de morrer de uma dor
de que agora andas bem fora
por isso vive em temor
que não sabe homem aquela hora
em que lhe há de vir o amor
não pode já longe vir
jano aquisto que te digo
vejo-te a barba pungir
olha como andas contigo:
à terra estranha irás
por teu gado não perderes
longos males passarás
por uns mui breves prazeres
que verás ou não verás
(e dando um pouco á cabeça,
á maneira d’anojado)
por teu bem porém te cresça
a barba (dixe) de honrado:
treslada-o no coração
isto que te aqui direi
que ainda que te aqui direi
que ainda alguns tempos virão
jano, que te alembrarei
mande deus que seja em vão
por cobrares a fazenda
a ti mesmo perderás
perda que não tem emenda
despois quando o saberás:
nos campos de uma ribeira
onde vales há a lugares
te está guardada a primeira
causa destes teus pesares
noutra parte a derradeira
jeitos em cousas pequenas
louros cabelos ondados
porão pera sempre em penas
a ti e a teus cuidados:
falas cheas de desdém
de presunção cheas delas
cousas que outras cousas têm
te causarão as querelas
de que morrer te convém
de todo o que te hei contado

between the rivers tagus
and guadiana, there lived,
it’s said, a shepherd lost
in love for one joana.
the maiden kept ducks
along the tagus’s banks,
her father’s house nearby.
the shepherd’s name was jano,
he hailed from alentejo.
when famine swept the land,
laying it all to waste,
the shepherd, seeking refuge,
fled torrão, his village.
he took with him the remnants
of his once-great flock,
the rest dead of exhaustion.
the drought-struck alentejo
was rather poor in pasture.
everywhere was the piteous
sight of barren fields!
only in the tagus’s
meadows could his flock
find relief. and so jano,
to save his dwindling herd,
set out for land to graze on.
the heart he held was troubled,
and trouble was waiting ahead.
the day that he arrived
with goats and sheep in tow,
he pitched camp at the edge
of a wood. the next morning,
while taking his flock to feed
along the river’s margins,
he laid eyes on joana,
out picking the flowers
that lined the tagus’s banks.
the dress she wore was white,
her cheeks were lightly flushed,
to jano, his eyes agog,
she looked fair and lovely.
though smitten at first sight,
he crouched behind the reeds,
admiring her from a distance.
joana gathered flowers,
in jano passion gathered.
after she had collected
her flowers and selected
the various shades, weaving
the blossoms together with roses,
she made a garland, and let
her hair fall: those tresses
were as long as she was tall.
every lock of her hair
was awakening jano’s desire.
as joana tidied her hair,
her flock of hens waddled
into the cool water,
guided by a huge mallard.
they swam, now upriver,
all in one direction,
now swiftly swam downstream,
together in single file.
joana placed the garland
on her head, stroking it
with her hands to see if
all sat perfectly in place.
not quite satisfied
with what her fingers revealed,
straight away she went
to where the river formed
a cove of placid water.
no sooner had she reached
the bank than her ducks came
flocking towards her, one after
the other, splashing wildly.
initially she’d delighted
in these shows of affection,
quickly her heart grew heavy.
flinging rocks and jeers,
she shooed the ducks away.
once they were all gone,
and the water calm again,
joana tucked her skirt up,
preparing for a swim.
she sat upon the bank,
carefully removing her slippers,
placing each on the ground.
then into the water she went,
and deep into jano’s heart.
as joana took delicate
steps into the river,
jano kept utterly still,
ablaze with desire and fear.
whether to speak, run,
stay put — he didn’t know.
love demanded boldness,
and yet the very thought of
losing her stirred up dread.
all this time joana
stood gazing at her reflection.
staring at her bosom,
she gave a sigh and said:
“what torment! a keeper
of ducks, i should be kept.
where is my life going?
what cruel sense of harmony:
to be fair and drudging away!
hearing these words jano
couldn’t contain himself.
having no other choice,
he burst out the grassy bank.
joana, feeling the thunderous
crash of jano’s footsteps,
turned and saw his face.
sensing the danger at hand,
she swiftly ran toward home.
the house where her father lived
was near, which plunged jano
further into the despair
born of their encounter.
the same fear that had urged
joana’s feet forward
also completely seized
her hands — and in her haste
she grabbed only one slipper.
looking around jano
saw there was no remedy,
turning his gaze to where
joana had studied her image.
when he spotted her slipper
on top the pebbly shore,
he raced over to retrieve it.
squeezing it in his arms,
he felt his sorrow grow,
and began to weep, bathing
his chest and the slipper in tears.
many were the reasons
for his anguished weeping.
leaning against his staff,
holding the slipper tightly,
jano paused for a moment
then he spoke from the heart,
exhausted and teary-eyed.
jano
“o remnant of the fairest
thing that i’ve ever seen,
to my eyes you are a rose,
and to my heart, thistles.
slipper cruelly forgotten,
remembering cruel passion,
who left you sweeps me away—
what an unfair exchange!
alas, that’s the way it must be.
“in my twenty-one years
i can’t remember feeling
even a pang of sorrow,
my flock’s troubles aside.
today, by some strange fate,
— i don’t know when exactly—,
i was racked by a yearning
that eclipsed my other cares,
becoming estranged myself.
“before this present sorrow,
which only multiplies,
although i had my cares,
the caring didn’t kill me.
but now it’s far too late,
i sense the change within,
my fate’s already sealed.
i do not grasp my anguish,
and languish of this passion.
“all i think is riddled
with glaring contradictions:
i oppose what i desire,
while desiring the opposite.
what i feel is so muddled,
i’m at odds with myself.
where might i look for relief?
i know the danger is grave—
graver is my confusion.
“who brought me to this strange
land, where an all-out war
awaited me and where i had
my hope taken away?
i scarcely can believe it:
here i am, reduced
to tears, passion’s slave.
the eyes with which i glimpsed
my beloved are taking revenge.
“my sorrow is greater still:
i brought this all on myself,
culprit and victim of infinite
suffering. had i only
stayed hidden in the reeds,
i would have feasted my eyes
on her beauty, and then —
since it has to be this way —,
at least i’d have my memory.
“disaster upon disaster!
yesterday i came here,
thinking my troubles gone.
oh how i was mistaken!
though i’d begun to hope
that, with my flock restored,
some good might come my way,
sadly, fortune willed
that i should suffer on.
“accursed love! who made me
love's prisoner knows none.
my sad, lonely eyes,
having met her gaze
on the banks of this river
that stretches unto infinity,
carrying water to sea:
you’ll be the faithful witnesses
to all my weighty sorrows.
author
having said these words,
transported by his passion,
jano fell on the sand,
like a man starved of air.
after some time had gone by,
jano still lying senseless,
a shepherd he used to know
passed by, noting the man
fast asleep on the ground.
franco of sandovir
was his name—searching
for a flute he had lost
but loved better than life,
this shepherd was adored
by none less than celia,
that finest of nymphs who bathed
in the mondego’s waters,
hers the sweetest of voices.
she gave the flute to franco
when he was leaving for exile
—imposed on him for his love—,
he weeping as she wept.
he had come here to live,
finding the landscape appropriate
for his aching heart:
rugged hills on all sides,
open fields to gaze on.
born to very little
in villages far apart,
these two shepherds had been
friends in bygone days.
for this reason franco
turned to take another
look at the man lying
on the ground, sensing
that something was amiss.
franco struggled greatly
deciding what to do—
were he to leave jano
behind, his heart would ache.
nor did he think it wise
to rouse his friend awake.
with jano being asleep
in an unfamiliar place,
he feared that he might startle.
franco wrestling with doubt,
jano turned on his back.
heaving a sigh, he said,
“all i do is suffer!”
when he heard these words,
franco turned around
in astonishment, noticing
the slipper tucked gingerly
beneath jano’s left arm.
he suspected what it was,
for he too was in love.
in jano’s bitter words
he’d all the proof he needed.
jano, now fully alert,
realizing it was franco,
stared in bewildered silence.
franco greeted him warmly
and with these words began:
franco
“why jano, i had thought
you lived in other parts.
i feared, for you and your flock,
the year might go this way.
when i caught word of the drought
now sweeping alentejo,
i hoped i’d see you here,
though certainly not in this state.
“tell me what harm’s been done
that you should be so changed?
what trouble found? thing lost?
if there’s a cure, you’ll have it.”
when jano, still quite weak,
tried to get up but stumbled,
franco held out his hand.
leaning against the trunk
of an ash tree jano said:
jano
“i came to the fields before me
to give life to my flock.
i slaked one desire only
to know greater thirst.
to my cattle i gave life,
having taken my own!
the prophecy’s been fulfilled,
as revealed by pierio,
when my first beard came in.
author
“among shepherds,” said franco,
“his reputation precedes him.
he considers all his friends;
he’s given, they say, to affairs.
now, jano, tell me this,
if he warned you in advance,
why this present hardship?
i hear he’s an honest friend
to men and women both.”
jano
“franco, i’ve grown so weary,
of the sorrow i’ve found
since coming to this place,
i can feel the strain in my voice.
whatever fortune brings,
a man can’t resist his fate,
what will be, will be—
there’s no escaping it, no point
fighting it, no hiding away.
“but with you, dear franco,
i can freely vent my pain.
knowing you to be a friend,
i wish to tell you everything.
i don’t ask that you provide
comfort or remedy, franco.
fr i can’t hope to be saved
from the trouble i’m in,
at least not till i die.
“it was a saint’s day feast:
all the people huddled
together, pilgrims come
from far and wide to see.
that day i remember dressing
in all new clothes, draped on
my shoulder was a woolen
hood coveted by the crowd.
in my hand i held my staff.
“taking me by the arm,
pierio led me some distance,
to a well-shaded grove.
telling me to take a seat
and sitting down next to me,
he paused and stared a while,
not saying a word, looking
on the verge of tears.
pierio
“jano,” he said, “i see
you don’t lack for worldly goods.
but with each passing year
my outlook grows more grim.
i see a black cloud looming.
now that you’re of age,
i see you stripped of freedom,
in exile far from home,
still farther from your will.
“in a land you’ve yet to see,
you’ll catch sight of something
that fills your heart with sorrow
for the rest of your days.
you’ll die of an affliction
that’s now just a distant threat.
live, therefore, in fear,
for no man knows the hour
when love will choose to strike.
“jano, the things i’ve said
can’t be very far away:
i see the down on your lip;
look at how you’re acting.
you’ll travel to a strange land
so as not to lose your flock,
enduring bitter hardships
for the briefest of pleasures,
so you’ll see, should you choose.”
pierio shook his head,
a stern look on his face.
“now, for your own sake,
act with manly honor,
and etch onto your heart
the words i’m about to say.
some hard days lie ahead,
jano, i must remind you.
may god prove me wrong!”
“in trying to save your flock,
you’ll become lost to yourself—
a loss that’s beyond repair
by the time it registers.
in the fields by the river,
among valleys, there lurks
your suffering’s first cause.
elsewhere you’ll meet your demise:
“her dainty mannerisms,
her wavy blonde hair
will subject your heart and mind
to never-ending punishment.
words laced with disdain,
words uttered in scorn,
a vast array of injuries —
it’ll all make you complain
so bitterly, you’d rather die.”
jano
“nearly all that i’ve said
happened as predicted.
what’s not yet come to pass,
the past has set in motion.
just a short while ago,
i caught sight of a lady
my eyes keep searching for.
my life and soul, she’s gone,
having deemed me unworthy.”
author
while jano spoke, a bloodhound
belonging to franco found
the missing flute, clutching it
with its teeth. when he saw,
bursting with joy, franco
ran to retrieve the flute.
standing on its hind legs,
the dog placed it in his hands,
proceeding to roll on its back.
franco turned to jano,
then he said these words:
“when he sees what he’s pined for,
a man forgets all else.
i cut your story short—
for that you’ll have to blame
whom i can’t, or forgive me
yourself, jano. you know
what it means to be in love.”
“that flute must be dear to you
as few things are,” said jano.
“indeed, nothing’s dearer,”
franco said in response.
“whoever gave you that
must have you in her debt,”
jano said to franco,
“truly you must play well ,
unless the dog got it wrong.”
“sing something, franco,
sadness loves a song!
let us see if your music
can’t soothe my bitter sorrow.”
“of course,” franco said,
“i will sing for you, jano,
as one sings for an ailing man.
although truth be told,
my song is but a wail.”
“i would like for you to hear
the song i sang last night,
after i had lost my flute,
left with only my voice.
when at last i went to bed,
i wasn’t tired of searching,
but weary of finding nothing.
now, jano, i mean it,
i couldn’t shut my eyes.”
“there, in the deep of night,
when all was utterly still,
i belted out my song,
an owl kept me company.
from his faraway perch,
—perhaps i only imagined it—
the owl would respond with sighs
as heavy as my own.
at any rate, here goes.”
song
wandering in exile i ask:
what to do, where to go?
after the deepest despair,
i’ve found the greatest sorrow.
the anguish! i’m a roving
stranger in remote lands,
to which i came in search
of refuge for my flock!
i, to whom cruel fortune
affords no consolation,
fear that, being ill-fated,
i will one day be made
to die by my own hand.
how to explain myself
to one not here to ask me?
how to beg forgiveness
of one who cannot hear me?
o gift of my beloved,
whose absence shrouds the night,
my flute, lost forever!
make a grave and bury me:
i perished long ago…
and upon my tombstone,
let these words be written:
in her heart lies my soul.
if on a distant day
in years to come, celia,
wherever she may be,
having heard the smallest
portion of all i suffered,
were to fall to pieces,
unable to hold back tears—
then would my soul be sated,
or whatever remains of me.
though i ask for nothing,
since i suffer so greatly,
let my eyes drift in reverie.
day after day slips by.
these lonely nights were made
for anguished spirits like ours.
“that’s the song, dear jano,
i believed it was my last;
i confess i hoped it’d mark
the end of all my suffering.
if mind and soul don’t perish
with the body, my sorrow
will remain. let us go,
it’s time the flock grazed,
torment too has its season.”",pt_XX,en_XX,"Eclogue II
They say there was a shepherd
Between the Tagus and Odiana,
Who was lost in love
For a girl named Joanna:
Joanna guarded the herd
By the banks of the Tagus
Her father lived nearby
And the shepherd from Alentejo
Was named Jano
When the great famines came
Alentejo was lost
From the land that they call torrão
This shepherd fled:
He took a little cattle
That was left of another great herd
That died of exhaustion
Since Alentejo was dry
Of water, and very barren of meadows
All the land was lost
In the field of the Tagus only
The cattle found shelter
Seeing Alentejo was a sorrow:
And Jano to save
The cattle that was left,
He went to this land to find,
And a care he took,
Another he found there
When he arrived
With his cattle and his belongings
He settled in a shelter
In a bush:
And leading it to pasture
The other day by the river
Joanna happened to see,
Who was wandering by the river
Of the Tagus: to flowers to pick
She was wearing a white dress
A little embarrassed she was
Beautiful she seemed
To the eyes of who looked at her:
Jano seeing her was astonished
But seeing what she was doing
He hid among the meadow:
Joanna was picking flowers
Jano was picking care
After she had the flowers
Already picked and chosen,
The varied colors
With roses interspersed:
She made of them a chapel
And let her hair loose
That were as long as she was
And seeing them Jano
A quarrel arose in him
And while Joanna was doing
This: her cattle wandered
In the water
All in a line
Sometimes upstream it went,
Sometimes, in the same manner
The river downstream
Joanna as she settled
The chapel: she touched with her hand
To her head, and looked
If it was in good condition:
Not being satisfied
With what her hand presumed
She left there straight
To where the river made
Of water: a calm, harvest
Arriving at the edge of the river,
The cows came one by one
That all the water stirred
And how much she had enjoyed
With these hosts
So much then it weighed her
And with stones and cries
From there she drove them away
After they were gone
And the water calmed down
Joanna the edges raised
To enter the water
And settling herself then
She took off her shoes
And putting them on the ground
Entered the water
And to Jano by the heart
While Joanna walked in the water
Among some desires and fears
Jano where he was burned
He did not know if he should speak
If he left, if he stayed
That love commanded him to dare
And so she would not lose her
He pretended to be afraid
They say in this meo
Joanna was looking
And uncovering her chest
She looked, and gave a sigh
Saying: I guard cows poor thing
I do not know where this will take me
But I was meant to be guarded
That this was a bad fate
Beautiful, and ill-employed
In this Jano hearing
Could not hold himself
That from the grass he came out
He did not run to meet her:
Joanna when she felt
The noises of Jano
And that he turned and saw him
Fear of the present harm
Gave her feet to flee
Very close was the farm
Where her father lived
That further away the harm went
That Jano had to see her:
But the fear that caused
Joanna to leave like that
So much it entangled her hands
That the left shoe there
With the hurry it stayed
Jano when he saw, and looked
That no remedy there was
To the place he returned
Where she in the water was:
And seeing the shoe there
On the sand, by the edge of the water
He ran to embrace it
Taking it his grief grew
And began to cry
The whole shoe and the chest
Were bathed in tears
Many were the respects
That this crying caused:
Leaning on his stick
The shoe in the other hand
After a long care
From the heart
He began to speak tired
Jano
Debris of the most beautiful
Thing, that my eyes have seen
For them you are a rose
And for the heart thorns:
Shoe left here
For another's evil for more evil
Who left you, take me
That such an exchange is unfair
But since it is so be it
Now I have twenty one years
And never yet 'té now
Me to awaken to feel pain
Of this my cattle outside:
And today by strange chance
I do not know in what hour I came
I received a great care
That put an end to the others
I myself am strange to myself
Before this evil came
That so many things are showing me
That some cares I had
They would not kill me caring
Now my cares do not understand
And I die like this of cares
Within my thought
There is so much adversity
That I feel against what I feel
Will and against will:
I am in such a turmoil
That I do not understand myself
Where shall I wait for a remedy
That I see the danger great
And much greater the opposite
Who has brought me to this alien land
Where such a great war was waiting
And the hope was taken:
Surprised at myself being
As in little I changed
But thinking about this standing
The eyes with which another looked at me
Were taking revenge on me
And because my evil is more
Of myself I have the greatest grievance
Of my endless grief
My cares cannot be other fates
My cares I do not understand
And I die like this of cares
And I speak within my thought
When yesterday I arrived here
That to you and to bad luck
Both I ended and erred:
Sad that seemed to me
That my cattle was remedied
And with me well would be
And was ordered
This other evil that still was there
The evil, you do not know it
Who me to you caused
Poor of my eyes alone
That found where I am:
Eyes: accuracy, place
Mor river of the rivers
That lead the waters to the sea
You will be true witnesses
Of the grief
Author
And saying this it seems
He was carried away in his evil
And as who the air lacks
He fell on that sand:
Great space passed
That he was there without sense
And in this meo came
A shepherd his known
And who slept believed
He came there
To look for a flute he lost
Frank of Sandovir was
His name, and he looked for
A flute that he lost
That he more than himself loved:
This was that shepherd
Who by Celie was much loved
Nymph of greater honor
That in Mondego bathed
And who better sang
And her flute was that one
That Celie gave her
When they banished him for her
Crying he, she crying:
He came there by chance
Because he found those lands
More conforming to the care
Of both parts surrounded by mountains,
In my fields to look
Of other times known
These two shepherds were
Of strange lands born
Not in the good they wished;
And for this reason
Frank to notice him
How he was on the ground
And to wake him up
He did not know if he hit
The place and the condition
Jano was lying on the ground
He gave a sigh
Jano, care, and more care:
Hearing this Jano said
Frank was astonished
And looking him better
From his left side
He saw the shoe he had
He suspected what it was
(That he was also in love)
And in what Jano said
He was certified
In this Jano woke up
When he saw Frank there
Without speaking a little stayed
Frank, after greeting him
Jano, he began to speak
Frank
I thought you were elsewhere
And for your, this year
It was a pity to go by this art:
I wished to see you here
When someone told me
The great drought there is
In Alentejo, and though
I would not want to see you like this:
Tell me what evil was this
That so changed you
Or what you had or lost
If there is a remedy you will have:
Jano then tries to rise
Not being able from tired
His hand was, Frank, to extend
And to a ash tree leaned
He began to respond
Jano
I came to these fields that I see
To give life to this my cattle
I saw a desire fulfilled,
Another greater begun:
To my cows I gave life
And to me it took away
The prophecy is fulfilled
That Pierio gave me
Seeing my beard pierced
Author
Of Pierio goes great fame
(Frank said) among the shepherds
All by friends are called
And they say he is given to loves,
I ask you Jano tell me
Since he advised you first
How you received the fatigue
That I hear it is very true
For friends and lovers
Jano
So tired, he answered
Of a care, Frank, I find myself
That now here in this place
That even in my voice",-1

na hora em que eu mais ruía
o sol aplainava o relvado, palmeiras
ondulavam num lago turvo
longe o escaravelho porvindoiro
que as reduziu a um coto
assemelhando-as a um ananás que degrada hoje
pelos jardins
o repuxo animava sem triunfo o pântano
da juventude
as varandas em fogo
o verão começando pelo fim
horas extraordinárias aquelas
em que as aves adiavam o repouso por causa
dos insectos do turno sequente
ourados absortos estrepitantes
a hora em que mais ninguém deitava como eu
a bicicleta sobre a falta
e se sentava na relva prendendo as lágrimas
as mãos tapando o rosto o rosto entre os geolhos e uma
roda atrás a girar
não havia o ecrã de bolso oportuno
era inevitável encarar o que não tem conserto
nem nunca terá
era do dia o instante altíloquo
uma harmónica crepitava nos auscultadores
feria de morte o touro da tarde
esse búfalo ermo que se aparta da manada
para ficar-se

sujo já por um grafito de província

perfume dos jantares

se entrevia o espalha-cor dos televisores

como flanela posta sobre a ganga das alturas

o coração alpinista no avesso dos volumes

e fartura – belo desastroso feroz – lugar de forças
e destruições

puro intrínseco
procurava um celeiro urbano onde guardar
o ouro-sémen pronto a detonar
a libélula extrema o grilo inicial
a andorinha cujo ninho resulta de um cúmulo
de lama e ervas secas e rasoira
as superfícies alimentando-se no ar
nas minhas costas o exíguo refrigério
da biblioteca pública

repousando da luta de guerrilha
hasta la derrota, siempre!

that moment when i was really falling apart
and the sun lingered over the lawn, and the palms
billowed above the turbid lake
faraway the promised beetle
reduced those palms to a stump
until they seemed like a pineapple which these days
rots in the gardens
the fountain blandly animated the swamp
of the young
the balconies on fire
the summer beginning at its end
overtime hours those
in which the birds delayed their naps because
of the next shift of insects
hallucinating self-absorbed clamorous

covering their face with their hands, face between their knees and a

a harmonica crackled in my headphones
mortally wounding the afternoon’s bull
that solitary buffalo that steers clear of the herd
to die

a newly painted wall
already marked with a small town’s graffito
a dog went past lifting its snout to the
scent of dinners
which came from where
the televisions’ color-blend rose in the air
there was the shred of moon
like flannel sewn onto the denim of the heights
it nurtured hoarded hurt
in the box of the future
the ivy of extensions twined through that hour

the mountaineer heart inside the volumes
rarefied

and overabundance – beautiful disastrous fierce – locus of forces
and ruin

pure intrinsic

the semen-gold ready to detonate

of mud and dried weeds who smooths
the surfaces feeding itself in the air

of the public library

resting from their war of resistance

but reluctant enemy

of youth
the balconies ablaze

‘i, too, dislike it: there are things that are important
beyond all this fiddle,’ marianne moore said about
poetry. in any case, she was able
to see mitochondria and all the other
tiny lives – eye fixed
on the minute blotch of watercolor
compressed between two glass slides
the pupil round with wonder
just before mystery: to know what it was.
is it more important to observe or to designate?
i fear sometimes i look askew
forget the tree where i left my keys
and my notebook, then i don’t know what to call
what, kind or relation, though i find
tranquility in the arcane language of the plane trees
behind the plaques in the botanical garden.
so i serve badly, i’m other, the odd one
out, a tourist here in so much
that pleases me and is work.
but it’s still not said (or is) if i insist
on my small scale in this myself
it’s because i don’t disconnect and touch and fail
at what’s in plain sight, raw
language clear in brute sky",pt_XX,en_XX,"diana
""I also don't like it, there are more things
beyond this mishmash,"" Marianne Moore said of poetry. Anyway, she could
see mitochondria and the rest of
the small lives - fixed gaze
on the tiny watercolor stain
compressed between round lamella slides
the pupil marveled
in advance at the mystery: knowing what it was.
is it more important to observe or to name?
I err in my gaze sometimes I fear
I forget the tree where I left the keys
and the notebook, afterward I don't know how to call
what, species or kinship, find perhaps
solace in the arcane tongue of the plane trees
behind the signs of the botanical garden.
so I serve poorly, am another, outside
the deck, tourist here amidst
what gives me pleasure and some work.
but it has not been said yet (or has it) whether I persist
on my small scale in this I do
it's because I don't disconnect and I touch and I fail

i’m watching her:
sweet the alp in the angle of her jaw
when she wakes
the canvas soaked at dawn
the grass outside darkens just as the sun rising
dilutes sleep
the mules feed off the fleeting
boreal pastures
before us a way opens up
luminously
glued to keeping quiet
to moving
but a breeze already inflames
making us want for a lake, placing
a range on the horizon
a less uncrossable elevation
than the lowlands of lived life
we say goodbye to the humid moss
fingered between thighs
stir the last pleasure out of the little
campfire that crackled
at the shelter’s opening through the long cold hours
we stuff rucksacks
leather and straps tested
we fixed our hair
munch a bit of flour
shredded bits of jerky
swigs of steaming coffee
we, the soldiers of alexander
whom nights of whiskey never fell
whose boots don’t weigh a thing
nor shame the fevers
the rectangle left by the tent
will remain for a while marking the plot of grass
stones ringing what had been
a scintillating flame later gone dark
now pasture to the scent of the timid
animals that will wander in
sounding out this sullied bit of the scene
at this very moment our scent
sails through narrow ravines
mixed with the dust and the clamor of hoofs that brings us
straying close on the edge of precipices
our own echoing
will embarrass us
but within – more silence even than the gorse
on the cliff sides –
and hardened, soaked with mist, atypical
arching over our maps
opening compasses
jotting quick notes about the way
and the error

I look at her:
sweet the vertex at the angle of the jaw
when she awakens
the canvas has soaked in the dawn
outside the grass tints as much as the rising star
dilutes the sleep
the mules graze the northern pastures of phantoms
before us a path articulates
illuminating
attached to the silence
to the movement
but already a breath inflames
returns us the desire of a lake, sets
on the horizon the mountain range
elevation less insurmountable
than the plain of the lived
we bid farewell to the moss heard
typed between thighs
we shake off what remains of pleasure
the small luminary that at the mouth of the shelter
long cold hours crackled
we stuff our backpacks
tested leather and bandages
straightened hair
we carry to our teeth a bit of flour
bits of dried meat
puffs of steaming coffee

to probe this soiled part of the place

will hover over ravines and gorges

we wandered the edge of the abyss

the big bang’s nimble plagiarism
the poem’s matter expands, cools
it lingers so oddly then stays put
similar to the universe
the poem is a mirror image of the body
with no reflection: hollow
asymmetrical, vestiges of that origin
positioned in a dubious place, nearly always apart
from the black hole they call literature
it might be imagined that few are the poets
capable of accelerating particles
as a way of seeing not only the distance the light has covered
but the central region of nihility, the furious
patio of power
and in this place of substances, of objects
the words are figures of waste, things
left over from the inaugural detonation of this first clean
whole day that climaxed in the minus-one ground of this brief logarithmic
text, purposeless and without any application
it’s the poet’s ruse:
to voice what leans into the infinite
to secretly observe the access each thing allows through the fissure of miracle
and which goes by the name of chance, or accident

where someone without realizing threw out the marvel
of a white helium balloon still full
that bounced up and rose in the guise of the moon in the late afternoon

and later remembered: you have to write a poem about the balloon

metade solar outra metade
adentrada na noite que divide e reparte irmãmente os dois
pedaços da mesma ideia:
redonda achatada nos polos insegura no seu tombo
escuridão afora
a cabeça pendular metida entre ombros
sombras
na órbita do absurdo a cumprir a curvatura que lhe cabe
errando distorcendo a silenciosa
nitidez dos hemisférios
enfeitada de gázeos, orifícios, rodeada
de visíveis

muito depois, tortuosos
brincando de se mostrar de se encobrir na açoteia
dos eventos
onde uma língua lambe partículas, intenta locuções
ou a mudez dos vaga-lumes
mas tudo de tudo se afasta

partindo do centro, desalcançando
e o todo se despenhe, móbil
veloz rebobinado, o retroverso inteiro, e vejamos passar
pelo buraco de uma agulha o camelo
do raciocínio
e neva nesta geometria

resplandece muito como se às mãos um lume
viesse entreter as trevas

queimando as ervas
enterrando os sinais
inclinando a esfera do pensamento para a água
seguimos por pequenas pistas ano a ano
menos nítidas
o sono alaga submerge com um peso nocturno
o corpo treme de anonimato
é no sossego de um quarto extinto rumoroso
que a nossa esfera abate na mole dos seus fantasmas

a outra e à única claridade
e nesse vácuo ou abertura nesse
floco de neve ampliado uma magnólia floresce e floresce

à potestade

arrefece na lâmpada do tecto

órfãs do disjuntor

half solar the other half
plunged in night that divides and fraternally shares two
scraps of the same idea:
round flattened at the poles insecure in its fall
out of darkness
the pendular head sunk between shoulders
shadows
the orbit of the absurd fulfilling its incumbent curvature
wandering distorting the silent
clarity of hemispheres
festooned in eyes of beryl, orifices, surrounded
by visibilities
panoramas breaking off that linger
long afterwards, coiling
a game of veiling and unveiling on the rooftop terrace
of events
where a tongue licks particles, proffers phrases
or the muteness of fireflies
but everything scatters from everything else
even though we thrust an arm into the void
out from the center, it’s thwarted
and everything crashes, velocious
mobile rewinding, an utter retroversion, and we can see
the camel of reason
pass through the eye of a needle
and it snows in this geometry
such
resplendence really as though a flame were handed to us
to fill the darkness
this is how we are upon the the face of the earth
burning the weeds
burying the signs
tipping the sphere of thinking into the water
each year we go down a series of narrow paths
ever dimmer
inundated, sleep is submerged under nocturnal weight
the body shudders with anonymity
it’s in the calm of a room humming with death
that our sphere falls into its crowd of ghosts
the ceiling opens on the celestial fire
on a different, a singular clarity
and in this emptiness, this opening, in this
high burgeoning snowflake a magnolia blooms and blooms
the immense sequoia of the world retires
to its dominion
while dimensions of fear and crap cool in their own venue
the naked bulb in the middle of the ceiling
the orphan waves of the circuit breaker are hushed
in hidden complexities
attend to fable-like vibrations beyond evidence
fade

erupted in the heavy breath of alveoli

very far, tortuous

into its power

guindastes do porto de roterdão, e apago-o com
a borracha da eternidade, para que ela se sente

das mães, afogavam-se em lama, no meio dos sambos. as paredes
das casas diluíam-se em nata e os oleiros desistiram de encomendar
a sua obra a deus. enormes cuidados foram inventados
para proteger o fogo nos altares e as crianças adoptaram a nudez.
as termiteiras deixaram de existir e as formigas aladas
perderam as asas. os pés dos mais-velhos fenderam-se em chagas
e as mamas das virgens, mal eram tocadas, colavam-se aos dedos
como cinza húmida. os lábios dos sexos das mulheres paridas
inchavam carnudos de uma carne branca e os ventres pendiam
como fruta mole.
naquele ano a chuva foi excessiva
e os horizontes deixaram de existir.
choveu por muito tempo até os cães perderem todo o pêlo
e as cabeleiras se destacarem como algas podres. o rei do jau
ficou colado ao trono e ao boi sagrado cresceram-lhe os olhos,
que depois cegaram. as sementes grelaram nos celeiros
e essa semente assim era servida aos homens e daí lhes ocorreu
um tal vigor que os seus sexos cresceram desmedidos
e os homens vacilaram, tendo-os nas mãos e mudos de fascínio.
a chuva choveu tanto que as serpentes saíram dos buracos
e vieram alongar-se ao pé dos paus, mantendo com esforço
as cabeças erguidas. nas terrinas do leite vicejavam musgos
e o leite das vacas alterou-se em soro, a coalhar na urina.
naquele ano a chuva choveu tanto que até nos areais cresceram
talos e as enxurradas produziram peixe e até o ferro se lavou
sozinho e os diamantes vieram rebolar nas pedras concavadas
de moer farinha. as próprias aves morreram quase todas
e apenas se salvaram as de penas brancas, que a distância atraiu,
depois comeu.
e aquela chuva aproveitou aos fósseis e houve minerais
que se animaram e até pedras comuns a transmudar-se em carne.
naquele ano a chuva choveu tanto que a memória perdeu todo
o sentido. as gargantas entupiram-se de limos
e as testas que os velhos pousavam nas mãos fundiam-se aos dedos
e os braços às pernas e os gestos de graça fundiam os corpos
e as jovens crianças ficavam coladas ao peito das mães.
só as bocas teimavam em manter-se abertas e quando mais tarde
a chuva parou, das bocas saíram grossas aves negras
que abalaram logo daquelas paragens. e a seca voltou

that was the year that the rains were excessive and mushrooms grew
in dogs’ eyes. the young bulls, looking out at the light from their mother’s crotches, drowned in the mud, in the middle of the vines. the walls of the houses dissolved in cream and the potters no longer entrusted their work to god. enormous measures were invented
to protect the altar flames and the children started to run around naked.
the termitaries ceased to exist and winged ants lost their wings. the feet of the oldest ones split open in sores and the breasts of virgins, as soon as you touched them, stuck to your fingers like wet ash. the lips of the birthing womens’ sex swelled plumply like white meat and their bellies hung like soft fruit.
that was the year the rain was excessive and the horizon ceased to exist.
it rained forever until the dogs lost all their fur and people’s hair stuck out like rotten seaweed. the king of jau got stuck to his throne and the sacred bullock’s eyes grew larger, and then went blind. the seed sprouted in the granaries and then it was served up to the men, just like that, and they were infused with such vigor that their cocks grew immeasurably and they reeled about, with the things in their hands, mute with the magic.

branches and the rushing streams spawned fish and even the iron washed itself alone and diamonds started to tumble around the stones hollowed out for milling flour. the birds themselves nearly all died and the only ones that saved themselves were those with white feathers, which the distance attracted, then ate.

That year the rain was excessive and tortulhos grew
In the dogs' eyes. The calves, peering the light through the mothers' sex,
Drowned in mud, in the midst of the sambos. The walls of the houses
Dissolved in cream and the potters gave up commissioning
Their work to God. Enormous cares were invented
To protect the fire on the altars and the children adopted nudity.
The termite hills ceased to exist and the winged ants
Lost their wings. The feet of the elders split into sores
And the breasts of the virgins, barely touched, stuck to the fingers
Like wet ash. The lips of the sex of the women who had given birth
Swelled with a fleshy, white flesh and the bellies hung
Like soft fruit.
That year the rain was excessive
And horizons ceased to exist.
It rained for so long the dogs lost all their fur
And the hair stood out like rotten seaweed. The king of the jau
Stuck to the throne and the sacred ox grew eyes,
Which later blinded. The seeds roasted in the granaries
And this roasted seed was served to the men and from there they had
Such a vigor that their sex grew unmeasured
And the men wavered, holding them in their hands and mute with fascination.
The rain rained so much that the snakes emerged from the holes
And came stretching near the poles, struggling
To keep the heads high. In the milk terrines moss flourished
And the cows' milk changed into whey, curdling in urine.
That year the rain rained so much that even in the sandbanks grew
Tendrils and the torrents produced fish and even iron washed itself
Alone and the diamonds came rolling on the concave stones
To grind flour. The birds themselves died almost all
And only the ones with white feathers were saved, which distance attracted,
Later ate.
And that rain benefited the fossils and there were minerals
That animated themselves and even common stones to transmute into flesh.
That year the rain rained so much that memory lost all
Its sense. The throats clogged with mosses
And the foreheads that the old men rested in their hands fused to the fingers
And the arms to the legs and the gestures of grace fused the bodies
And the young children stayed glued to the mothers' chests.
Only the mouths insisted on staying open and when later
The rain stopped, from the mouths came thick black birds
That immediately left those lands. And the drought returned
And the world dried. The old flesh now giving way to earth,
The fossils in stone and the branches in humus.
And the steps slowly polished the forms.

"os figos de d.h. lawrence
lawrence aconselhou a que se partisse um figo
em quatro pedaços, para o comer, depois de deitar fora
a casca. deste modo, pensava ele, a sociedade não veria
com maus olhos o gesto de cortar o figo, e de o
saborear lentamente, como quem lê um poema. mas
nem todos os figos se podem comer desta maneira; e,
no caso dos figos verdes, o melhor é tirar-lhes a pele a
partir de cima, sem que ela se desprenda completamente
do fruto; e só depois de comer a parte de cima, é que
chegará o momento em que só vai ficar um pouco de figo
a segurar a casca. nessa altura, pode-se arrancá-la, e acabar
de comer o que sobra, para que a refeição fique completa.
de facto, lawrence também admite esta solução (e
aceita que se coma também a casca); mas teremos
de ir mais longe do que ele, o que significa
que se deve também pensar na figueira. e se, ao comermos
o figo, a árvore nos agarra a alma com os seus ramos
ásperos, obrigando-nos a afastar as folhas para ver como
é que se pode fugir debaixo dela, o sabor que fica na boca
lembra a imagem da mulher primitiva, com o seu ventre redondo
como o dos figos de s. joão, os primeiros, que se colhem
com um gesto só, ficando inteiros na mão. então, a mão
torna-se um prolongamento da figueira, e começo a pensar
que talvez possam nascer folhas de figueira nos braços,
como se estes fossem ramos; e que essas folhas servirão para
tapar os figos que irei colher, mantendo a sua frescura.
em alternativa, poderei transformar o tronco da figueira
num corpo de mulher nua; e essas folhas irão vesti-la. mas o figo
que tenho na mão far-me-á sentir os seus seios macios, fazendo
com que, ao tirar a casca do figo, a mulher saia de dentro dele,
e eu possa chegar à mesma conclusão de lawrence sobre
as múltiplas formas de comer um figo.","d.h. lawrence’s figs
lawrence recommended that the fig be divided into
into four pieces, for eating, after discarding
the skin. in this way, he reasoned, society would not look
askance upon the act of cutting open the fig and of
savoring it slowly, as one would read a poem. but
not all figs can be eaten in such a way; and
in the case of green figs, it’s better to skin them from
the top down, without separating the skin completely
from the fruit; it’s only after eating the top part, that
the moment arrives where there is only a bit of fig left
clinging to its skin. then you can finally pluck it, and finish
eating what is left, for the meal to be complete.
indeed, lawrence also acknowledges this solution (and
also says it’s okay to eat the skin); but we must
go even further than he does, which means that we must
also consider the tree itself. and if, while we’re eating
the fig, the tree grabs our soul with its rough
branches, making it necessary to pull back its leaves to see how
it is we can escape beneath it, the taste which lingers in the mouth
recalls the image of the primitive woman, with her round womb
like the one of the early figs of saint john, the first ones, that are gathered up
whole, in one sweep of the hand. so, my hand
becomes an extension of the fig tree, and i begin to think
that perhaps fig leaves will start growing from my arms,
as though they were branches; and that these leaves will hide
the figs that i will gather, keeping them fresh.
alternatively, i could transform the trunk of the fig tree
into the body of a naked woman; and these leaves would adorn her. but the fig
that i have in my hand will make me feel her soft breasts, making
it seem like in stripping the skin from the fig the woman might appear from within,
and i would reach the same conclusion as lawrence about
the many ways to eat a fig.",pt_XX,en_XX,"the figs of d.h. lawrence

to eat, after discarding the skin. in this way, he thought,
society would not view with ill favor the act of cutting the fig
and savoring it slowly, as one reads a poem. but not all figs
can be eaten this way; and, in the case of green figs, the best
is to remove the skin from the top without it completely letting
go of the fruit; and only after eating the top part, will come
the time when just a bit of fig will remain to hold the skin.
at this point, one can tear it off, and finish eating what's left,
so the meal will be complete. indeed, lawrence also admits this
solution (and accepts eating the skin as well); but we must go
further than him, which means we should also think about the

rough branches, forcing us to move the leaves aside to see how
we can escape beneath it, the taste that remains in the mouth

with a single gesture, remaining whole in the hand. then, the hand

out from within it, and i can arrive at the same conclusion as lawrence

ave-marias
nas nossas ruas, ao anoitecer,
há tal soturnidade, há tal melancolia,
que as sombras, o bulício, o tejo, a maresia
despertam-me um desejo absurdo de sofrer.
o céu parece baixo e de neblina,
o gás extravasado enjoa-me, perturba;
e os edifícios, com as chaminés, e a turba
toldam-se duma cor monótona e londrina.
batem carros de aluguer, ao fundo,
levando à via-férrea os que se vão. felizes!
ocorrem-me em revista exposições, países:
madrid, paris, berlim, s. petersburgo, o mundo!
semelham-se a gaiolas, com viveiros,
as edificações somente emadeiradas:
como morcegos, ao cair das badaladas,
saltam de viga em viga os mestres carpinteiros.
voltam os calafates, aos magotes,
de jaquetão ao ombro, enfarruscados, secos;
embrenho-me, a cismar, por boqueirões, por becos,
ou erro pelos cais a que se atracam botes.
e evoco, então, as crónicas navais:
mouros, baixéis, heróis, tudo ressuscitado!
luta camões no sul, salvando um livro a nado!
singram soberbas naus que eu não verei jamais!
e o fim da tarde inspira-me; e incomoda!
de um couraçado inglês vogam os escaleres;
e em terra num tinir de louças e talheres
flamejam, ao jantar alguns hotéis da moda.
num trem de praça arengam dois dentistas;
um trôpego arlequim braceja numas andas;
os querubins do lar flutuam nas varandas;
às portas, em cabelo, enfadam-se os lojistas!
vazam-se os arsenais e as oficinas;
reluz, viscoso, o rio, apressam-se as obreiras;
e num cardume negro, hercúleas, galhofeiras,
correndo com firmeza, assomam as varinas.
vêm sacudindo as ancas opulentas!
seus troncos varonis recordam-me pilastras;
e algumas, à cabeça, embalam nas canastras
os filhos que depois naufragam nas tormentas.
descalças! nas descargas de carvão,
desde manhã à noite, a bordo das fragatas;
e apinham-se num bairro aonde miam gatas,
e o peixe podre gera os focos de infecção!
ii
noite fechada
toca-se às grades, nas cadeias. som
que mortifica e deixa umas loucuras mansas!
o aljube, em que hoje estão velhinhas e crianças,
bem raramente encerra uma mulher de “dom”!
e eu desconfio, até, de um aneurisma
tão mórbido me sinto, ao acender das luzes;
à vista das prisões, da velha sé, das cruzes,
chora-me o coração que se enche e que se abisma.
a espaços, iluminam-se os andares,
e as tascas, os cafés, as tendas, os estancos
alastram em lençol os seus reflexos brancos;
e a lua lembra o circo e os jogos malabares.
duas igrejas, num saudoso largo,
lançam a nódoa negra e fúnebre do clero:
nelas esfumo um ermo inquisidor severo,
assim que pela história eu me aventuro e alargo.
na parte que abateu no terremoto,
muram-me as construções rectas, iguais, crescidas;
afrontam-me, no resto, as íngremes subidas,
e os sinos dum tanger monástico e devoto.
mas, num recinto público e vulgar,
com bancos de namoro e exíguas pimenteiras,
brônzeo, monumental, de proporções guerreiras,
um épico doutrora ascende, num pilar!
e eu sonho o cólera, imagino a febre,
nesta acumulação de corpos enfezados;
sombrios e espectrais recolhem os soldados;
inflama-se um palácio em face de um casebre.
partem patrulhas de cavalaria
dos arcos dos quartéis que foram já conventos;
idade média! a pé, outras, a passos lentos,
derramam-se por toda a capital, que esfria.
triste cidade! eu temo que me avives
uma paixão defunta! aos lampiões distantes,
enlutam-me, alvejando, as tuas elegantes,
curvadas a sorrir às montras dos ourives.
e mais: as costureiras, as floristas
descem dos magasins, causam-me sobressaltos;
custa-lhes a elevar os seus pescoços altos
e muitas delas são comparsas ou coristas.
e eu, de luneta de uma lente só,
eu acho sempre assunto a quadros revoltados:
entro na brasserie; às mesas de emigrados,
ao riso e à crua luz joga-se o dominó.

ao gás
e saio. a noite pesa, esmaga. nos
passeios de lajedo arrastam-se as impuras.
ó moles hospitais! sai das embocaduras
um sopro que arripia os ombros quase nus.
cercam-me as lojas, tépidas. eu penso
ver círios laterais, ver filas de capelas,
com santos e fiéis, andores, ramos, velas,
em uma catedral de um comprimento imenso.
as burguesinhas do catolicismo
resvalam pelo chão minado pelos canos;
e lembram-me, ao chorar doente dos pianos,
as freiras que os jejuns matavam de histerismo.
num cutileiro, de avental, ao torno,
um forjador maneja um malho, rubramente;
e de uma padaria exala-se, inda quente,
um cheiro salutar e honesto a pão no forno.
e eu que medito um livro que exacerbe,
quisera que o real e a análise mo dessem;
casas de confecções e modas resplandecem;
pelas vitrines olha um ratoneiro imberbe.
longas descidas! não poder pintar
com versos magistrais, salubres e sinceros,
a esguia difusão dos vossos reverberos,
e a vossa palidez romântica e lunar!
que grande cobra, a lúbrica pessoa,
que espartilhada escolhe uns xales com debuxo!
sua excelência atrai, magnética, entre luxo,
que ao longo dos balcões de mogno se amontoa.
e aquela velha, de bandós! por vezes,
a sua traîne imita um leque antigo, aberto,
nas barras verticais, a duas tintas. perto,
escarvam, à vitória, os seus mecklemburgueses.
desdobram-se tecidos estrangeiros;
plantas ornamentais secam nos mostradores;
flocos de pós de arroz pairam sufocadores,
e em nuvens de cetins requebram-se os caixeiros.
mas tudo cansa! apagam-se nas frentes
os candelabros, como estrelas, pouco a pouco;
da solidão regouga um cauteleiro rouco;
tornam-se mausoléus as armações fulgentes.
“dó da miséria!... compaixão de mim!...”
e, nas esquinas, calvo, eterno, sem repouso,
pede-me esmola um homenzinho idoso,
meu velho professor nas aulas de latim!

horas mortas
o tecto fundo de oxigénio, de ar,
estende-se ao comprido, ao meio das trapeiras;
vêm lágrimas de luz dos astros com olheiras,
enleva-me a quimera azul de transmigrar.
por baixo, que portões! que arruamentos!
um parafuso cai nas lajes, às escuras:
colocam-se taipais, rangem as fechaduras,
e os olhos dum caleche espantam-me, sangrentos.
e eu sigo, como as linhas de uma pauta
a dupla correnteza augusta das fachadas;
pois sobem, no silêncio, infaustas e trinadas,
as notas pastoris de uma longínqua flauta.
se eu não morresse, nunca! e eternamente
buscasse e conseguisse a perfeição das cousas!
esqueço-me a prever castíssimas esposas,
que aninhem em mansões de vidro transparente!
ó nossos filhos! que de sonhos ágeis,
pousando, vos trarão a nitidez às vidas!
eu quero as vossas mães e irmãs estremecidas,
numas habitações translúcidas e frágeis.
ah! como a raça ruiva do porvir,
e as frotas dos avós, e os nómadas ardentes,
nós vamos explorar todos os continentes
e pelas vastidões aquáticas seguir!
mas se vivemos, os emparedados,
sem árvores, no vale escuro das muralhas!...
julgo avistar, na treva, as folhas das navalhas
e os gritos de socorro ouvir estrangulados.
e nestes nebulosos corredores
nauseiam-me, surgindo, os ventres das tabernas;
na volta, com saudade, e aos bordos sobre as pernas,
cantam, de braço dado, uns tristes bebedores.
eu não receio, todavia, os roubos;
afastam-se, a distância, os dúbios caminhantes;
e sujos, sem ladrar, ósseos, febris, errantes,
amareladamente, os cães parecem lobos.
e os guardas, que revistam as escadas,
caminham de lanterna e servem de chaveiros;
por cima, as imorais, nos seus roupões ligeiros,
tossem, fumando sobre a pedra das sacadas.

vespers
when evening falls across our streets
and sullen melancholy fills the air,
the tagus, the tang, the shadows and bustle
bring me an absurd desire to suffer.
the sky hangs low and seems all hazy;
the gas from the streetlamps makes me queasy;
the tumult of buildings, chimneys and people
is cloaked in a dullish, londonish hue.
oh lucky travellers in hired coaches
now hieing to the railway station! countries
and exhibitions file past me: madrid,
paris, berlin, st petersburg, the world!
the timber frames of future buildings
resemble cages for keeping animals;
like swooping bats the carpenters leap
from beam to beam at the sound of the bell.
clusters of callous, tar-smeared caulkers
return from the slipways, coats on their shoulders;
i wander through alleys that lead to the river
or walk by the wharves where boats are docked.
i evoke the ocean chronicles: the moors,
old vessels and heroes – all resurrected!
shipwrecked camões swims his book to shore! (1)
great carracks that i’ll never see ride the waves!
the twilight inspires, and also disturbs me!
an english battleship launches its cutters
while swank hotels on land bedazzle
with china and flatware clinking at dinner.
two dentists argue inside a streetcar;
a clumsy clown is struggling on stilts;
children flit, like cherubs, on balconies;
hatless, bored shopkeepers wait at their doors!
the shipyards and workshops are emptying out;
the river glints thickly, the workwomen hurry;
and a black school of herculean fishwives
bursts out of nowhere, joking, laughing.
wagging sumptuous hips they come!
their manly torsos remind me of pillars;
and some, in the baskets on their heads,
rock sons who’ll one day drown in storms.
on frigates – barefoot! – they unload coal (2)
from dawn to dusk, then crowd together
in a neighbourhood where cats meow
and the rotting fish breed infection!
ii
after dark
prisoners bang on the bars of their cells –
a sound that rattles my nerves with shame!
the aljube jail, for old women and children,
rarely encloses a titled lady!
i feel so ill as the lights come on
i worry i might have an aneurysm;
the sight of the jails, crosses, cathedral,
fills and sinks my heart with tears.
one floor after another lights up,
and cafés, restaurants, tobacco and other shops
spread like a sheet their white reflections.
the moon brings jugglers, the circus, to mind.
on an ancient square two churches raise
the clergy’s black, funereal spectre;
i sketch there a lonely, dour inquisitor,
daring to extend myself into history.
in quarters which the earthquake flattened
equal, straight buildings wall me in; (3)
everywhere else i face steep streets
and the tolling of pious, monastic bells.
but gracing a common, public square
with lovers’ benches and lithe pepper trees
a war-sized monument cast in bronze
stands, on a pillar, for an epic that was! (4)
and in this assemblage of stunted bodies
i think of the fever, imagine the cholera;
returning soldiers look sombre as ghosts;
a gleaming palace stands opposite a hovel.
mounted patrolmen set out from the archways
of army barracks that once were convents;
the middle ages! others, on foot,
range through the capital, now turning cold.
sad town! i dread you’ll arouse a dead passion
in me! i mourn upon seeing your elegant
ladies so white in the lamp-lit distance,
leaning and smiling at jewellers’ windows.
coming down from the department stores,
the florists and dressmakers wrench my gut;
they’re hardly able to hold up their heads,
and many are walk-ons and chorus girls.
even in sordid human tableaus
i, with my pince-nez, find subject matter:
i enter the beerhouse; at the immigrants’ tables,
harshly lit, they laugh and play dominoes.
iii
by gaslight
and i go back out. the night’s weight crushes.
impure women roam the sidewalks.
o languid hospitals! ill-clad shoulders
shiver from drafts where streets open up.
warm shops surround me. i think i’m seeing
flanking candles, rows of chapels
with saints and the faithful, flowers, more candles,
more saints, in a vastly long cathedral.
the bourgeois women of catholicism
slip on the ground that’s tunnelled by drainpipes.
to me they recall, with their whining pianos,
the nuns who, fasting, died of madness.
an aproned knife maker, working the lathe,
redhotly wields his blacksmith’s hammer;
and bread, still warm, from the baker’s oven
sends forth its honest, wholesome smell.
and i, whose goal is a book that galls,
want it to show and examine what’s real.
boutiques shine with the latest fashions;
a street urchin gapes at their window displays.
o long descents! could i but paint
with skilled, sincere, salubrious verses
the delicate shimmering of your streetlamps
and all your romantic moonlit pallor!
that sensual, corseted creature selecting
printed shawls – she moves like a snake!
her excellence is a magnet amidst
the finery piled on mahogany counters.
and that old dame with coiled plaits!
her train with its vertical, two-tone stripes
mocks a spread fan! her mecklenburg horses
wait with the carriage, pawing the pavement.
decorative plants wilt on the tables
where clerks unroll their foreign fabrics;
in clouds of satins they bow and smile;
rice powder hovers and chokes the air.
but all grows weary! slowly, like stars,
the storefronts’ hanging lights go dim;
the glittering buildings become mausoleums;
a lone, hoarse voice hawks lottery tickets.
and there on a corner: “please, sir! take pity!”
whenever i pass him, that little old man,
bald and eternal, begs for alms:
the teacher at school who taught me latin!
iv
the dead hours
the lofty ceiling of air, of oxygen,
runs between the facing rooftops;
the stars’ tired eyes shed tears of light;
blue dreams of transmigration exalt me.
below all that, what portals! what streets!
i hear, in the dark, a screw hit the ground,
the clacking of shutters, the jangle of locks;
and the bloodshot eyes of a buggy scare me.
i follow, like lines on a music stave,
the stately double row of façades
while pastoral notes from a distant flute
trill, in the silence, a gloomy warning.
oh, if i’d never die! if forever
i’d seek and attain the perfection of things!
i lose myself envisioning wives
who chastely nest in clear-glass mansions!
dear sons! what swift dreams, alighting,
will bring sharp clarity to your lives!
i want the mothers and sisters you love
to live in luminous, fragile homes.
ah! like our grandfathers’ fleets, like fervent
nomads, like the ruddy race to come, (5)
we’ll go and explore every continent
and sail across the watery expanses!
but how, if we live enclosed by stone
in a dark and treeless valley of walls?
i think i see knives flash in the shadows
and hear a strangled cry for help.
and along these murky corridors
the taverns, if i peer in, appall me.
some sorry drunks are staggering home
and sing, arms joined, for old time’s sake.
but i’m not afraid of being robbed;
the dubious characters fall behind me.
the scrawny and mangy dogs don’t bark;
they look a little like yellowish wolves.
and those keepers of keys, the night watchmen,
scan with their lanterns each entryway;
above them loose women, in scanty robes,
smoke and cough at the balcony windows.

of tomblike buildings tall as hills,
human pain, like a baleful sea,
seeks vast horizons for its bitter tides!",pt_XX,en_XX,"The Feeling of a Westerner

Ave Marias
In our streets, at twilight,
There's such sullenness, such melancholy,
That the shadows, the bustle, the river, the briny
Awaken in me an absurd desire to suffer.
The sky seems low and fog-laden,
The gas that leaks sickens me, disturbs;
And the buildings, with the chimneys, and the crowd
Turn a monotonous and London-like hue.
Trams chime, in the distance,
Carrying off the happy ones to the railway.
Countries and exhibitions flash before my eyes:
Madrid, Paris, Berlin, St. Petersburg, the world!
The buildings resemble cages with aviaries,
As bats, upon the chiming of the bells,
They leap from beam to beam the master carpenters.
The shipbuilders return in droves,
With oilskins over their shoulders, grimy, dry;
I wander through alleyways and narrow streets,
Or stray along docksides where boats are moored.
And I recall naval chronicles:
Moors, caravels, heroes, all resurrected!
Camões fights in the south, saving a book by swimming!
Grand ships sail by that I shall never see!
And twilight inspires me; and it pains!
From an English battleship boats are rowing out;
And onshore, in a clinking of plates and cutlery,
Some fashionable hotels blaze.
Two dentists argue in a hansom cab;
A lopsided clown struggles with his hoops;
The cherubs of the home float on the balconies;
At the doors, disheveled, shopkeepers are bored!
Factories and arsenals are emptied;
The river gleams viscous, the workers hurry;
And in a school of black, robust, playful,
They rush with firmness, the varinas appear.
They shake their plump hips!
Their sturdy trunks remind me of pillars;
And some, on their heads, rock their babies in baskets
Who will later drown in the storms.
Unshod! In the coal unloading,
From morning to night, aboard the ships;
And they crowd in a neighborhood where cats meow,
And rotten fish breed the foci of infection!
II
Closed Night
They call at the grilles, in the prisons. Sound
That mortifies and leaves gentle insanities!
The prison where today there are old women and children,
Rarely confines a woman of ""distinction""!
And I even suspect an aneurysm
So morbid I feel, at the lighting of the lamps;
At the sight of prisons, the old cathedral, the crosses,
My heart cries out, that swells and that sinks.
At intervals, the floors are illuminated,
And the taverns, cafes, shops, tobacconists
Spread their white reflections;
And the moon reminds me of the circus and the jugglers.
Two churches in a nostalgic square,
Cast a black stain and funereal of the clergy:
In them I dissipate an austere inquisitor,
As soon as I venture through history and expand.
In the part that collapsed in the earthquake,
The straight, equal, growing constructions enclose me;
In the rest, the steep ascents confront me,
And the bells of a monastic and devout ringing.
But, in a public and vulgar place,
With benches for lovers and slender pepper plants,
Bronze, monumental, of warlike proportions,
An epic hero ascends, on a pillar!
And I dream of cholera, I imagine the fever,
In this accumulation of stunted bodies;
Gloomy and spectral, the soldiers return;
A palace is set ablaze in the face of a hut.
Cavalry patrols leave the arches
Of barracks that were once monasteries;
Aged, others, in slow steps,
They spread throughout the capital, which cools.
Sad city! I fear that a dead passion
Will be revived for me in the distant lamps;
Your elegant women grieve me, white,
Curved to smile at the showcases of goldsmiths.
And more: the seamstresses, the florists
Descend from the department stores, causing me a jolt;
They struggle to raise their high necks
And many of them are chorus girls or accomplices.
And I, with a one-eyed lens,
I always find subject for revolted pictures:
I enter the brasserie; at tables of emigrants,
To laughter and harsh light, domino is played.
III
Under Gaslight
And I leave. The night weighs, crushes. On
The flagstone sidewalks, the impure drag themselves.
Oh, moles hospitals! Emerging from the entrances
A breath that chills the shoulders almost naked.
The shops surround me, warm. I think
I see side candles, see rows of chapels,
With saints and faithful, litters, branches, candles,
In a cathedral of immense length.
The little bourgeois of Catholicism
Slide on the floor mined by pipes;
And the piano's sick moan reminds me of the nuns
Who were killed by fasting in the Middle Ages.
In a cutler, with an apron, at the lathe,
A blacksmith swings a hammer, redly;
And from a bakery, still warm, exhales,
A wholesome and honest smell of bread in the oven.
And I who meditate a book that exacerbates,
I wish that the real and the analysis would give it to me;
Confectionery and fashion stores shine brightly;
Through the showcases an undercover man looks on.
Long descents! To paint
With verses, masterful, healthy and sincere,
The diffuse scattering of your reverberators,
And your pale, romantic and lunar look!
What a great snake, the lubricious person,
Who chooses a shawl with a debuxo pattern!
His Excellency attracts, magnetic, amidst luxury,
That along the mahogany balconies gathers.
And that old woman, with tippets! Sometimes,
Her train imitates an old fan, open,
In vertical stripes, two colors. Nearby,
Her Mecklenburg escorts prance victorious.
Foreign fabrics are displayed;
Ornamental plants dry on the shelves;
Flakes of rice powder float suffocating,
And in clouds of satin the shop assistants sway.
But everything bores! Lanterns extinguish
On the fronts, like stars, little by little;
From solitude, a hoarse peddler croaks;
They become mausoleums the radiant frameworks.
""Pity of misery!... Compassion for me!...""
And in the corners, bald, eternal, without rest,
An old man asks me for alms,
My old teacher in the Latin classes!
IV
Dead Hours
The deep ceiling of oxygen, air,
Stretches along the skylight vents;
Tears of light come from the starry eyes,
I am enthralled by the azure chimera of transmigrate.
Below, what gates! What passageways!
A bolt falls on the slabs, in the dark:
Shutters are placed, locks creak,
And the eyes of a hack chaise frighten me, bloody.
And I follow, like the lines of a staff
The august double stream of the façades;
For the silence ascends, inauspicious and whining,
The pastoral notes of a distant flute.
If I did not die, never! And eternally
Sought and achieved the perfection of things!
I forget myself to envision most chaste wives,
That nest in mansions of transparent glass!
Oh! Our children! What agile dreams,
Coming to you will bring clarity to your lives!
I want your mothers and sisters moved,
In translucent and fragile dwellings.
Ah! How the red-haired race of the future,
And the fleets of our grandfathers, and the wandering beings,
We will explore all continents
And through the vast aquatic expanses follow!
But if we live, the walled ones,
Without trees, in the dark valley of the walls!...
I think I see, in the dark, the blades of knives
And the cries of help strangled hear.
And in these cloudy corridors
They nauseate me, arising, the bellies of the taverns;
On the way, with longing, and on the edges resting their knees,
They sing, arm in arm, some sad drinkers.
I do not fear, however, the thefts;
The dubious passersby move away at a distance;
And dirty, without barking, bony, feverish, wandering,
The dogs seem wolves yellowly.
And the guards, who search the staircases,
Walk with lanterns and serve as keyholders;
Above, the immoral ones, in their light robes,
Cough, smoking on the stone of the balconies.
And, enormous, in this irregular mass
Of sepulchral buildings, with dimensions of hills,
Human pain seeks the wide horizons,
And has tides, of gall, like a sinister sea!",0

quem quer que lhe tivesse concebido os ossos, era então visível o objectivo de os fazer florir. deles brotaria a pele, o céu, a encenação da glória. tudo isso mais não eram, entretanto, do que imagens em apuros, imagens atacadas por memórias em conflito com o presente, ou mesmo com o passado onde pareciam radicar, e que, esbeiçando-se nos bordos, davam lugar a que o esquecimento sobre elas actuasse como uma espécie de ácido sulfúrico.
de cada vez que o invadia, a enxurrada da memória ascendia-lhe assim a um tal nível da consciência que os seus próprios ossos, deixando de ser pontos fixos e estáveis aos quais ele se pudesse segurar, vinham, desmantelados, boiar à superfície das águas borrascosas, de mistura

debaixo da carroça trota a coelheira,
aproveitando a sombra débil e ambulante.
sentado na boleia, as rédeas na mão morena
descuidadas, um homem cisma, confia
do caminho ao macho lento a decisão.
outros homens a pé e mulheres novas
entretêm de riso a caminhada espessa.

de alguma enfermidade menos limpa
e neles cravam dentes de fome milenária.
dizem que as mulheres estão na intimidade
das estrelas e a troco de uns mil-réis
lêem nas mãos destinos coloridos.

e os aldeões, em pânico secreto,
os expulsam com voz impiedosa e decidida mão
das cercanias do seu chão governado.

em negócios sempre escuros de animais,
em que fazem passar por uma estampa
o mais escalavrado e cego dos cavalos.

têm por costume, depois de embriagados,
trocar com as bengalas possantes e vistosas
pancadaria rija, de que morrem.

slackly holding the reins, a man daydreams,

pétalas são as vogais, e o caule uma consoante. põe-se
no jarro da estrofe, e deixa-se estar. para que não morra,
basta um pedaço de primavera na água, que se vai
buscar à imaginação, quando está um dia de chuva,
ou se faz entrar pela janela, quando o ar fresco
da manhã enche o quarto de azul. então,
a flor confunde-se com o poema, mas ainda não é
o poema. para que ele nasça, a flor precisa
de encontrar cores mais naturais do que essas
que a natureza lhe deu. podem ser as cores do teu
rosto – a sua brancura, quando o sol vem ter contigo,
ou o fundo dos teus olhos em que todas as cores
da vida se confundem, com o brilho da vida. depois,

of morning fills the blue room. this is when
the flower begins to seem like a poem, but it’s still not

to find more natural colors than those

of your complexion – its whiteness, when the sun falls on you,
or the depths of your eyes in which all the colors
of life mix with the sheen of life. after that,

It had never dawned like this, in an unimaginable
shack near the gothic city.
His home.
He was known from the fandango,
and knew only that a tearless sadness
lit his afternoons and nights.
This time was different. I had just shattered
a glass in the only pub still open

an untimely euphemism. The dog,
at least, liked to see us arrive.
Then he wept, for no reason. He only wanted
a concrete shoulder to lay his head
on, as his wife and daughters no longer,
even by mistake, kissed him. He needed no gestures or words,
he just wanted to be heard, to share the unshareable
which he perhaps called (I'm not quite sure) pain.
He fell asleep on my shoulder — and I was
capable of killing (but not him) for a beer,
for the gin that just hours before had found the floor
too soon. At dawn, I gently shook him,
told him I really had to go. He kissed
my hand, thanked with a ruined smile
that nothing of nothing between two men
who will never see each other again. Outside,
a gagged light discouraged any

in the various waste that made his solitude less lonely.

quem tão baixa tivesse a fantasia
que nunca em mores cousas a metesse
que em só levar seu gado à fonte fria
e mungir-lhe o leite que bebesse!
quão bem-aventurado que seria!
que, por mais que fortuna revolvesse,
nunca em si sentiria maior pena
que pesar-lhe da vida ser pequena.
veria erguer do sol a roxa face,
veria correr sempre a clara fonte,
sem imaginar a água donde nace,
nem quem a luz esconde no horizonte.
tangendo a frauta donde o gado pace,
conheceria as ervas do alto monte;
em deus creria, simples e quieto,
sem mais especular nenhum secreto.
de um certo trasilau se lê e escreve,
entre as cousas da velha antiguidade,
que perdido um grão tempo o siso teve
por causa dũa grande infirmidade;
e enquanto, de si fora, doudo esteve,
tinha por teima e cria por verdade,
que eram suas as naus que navegavam,
quantas no porto píreo ancoravam.
por um senhor mui grande se teria
(além da vida alegre que passava),
pois nas que se perdiam não perdia,
e das que vinham salvas se alegrava.
não tardou muito tempo quando, um dia,
um crito, seu irmão, que ausente estava,
à terra chega; e vendo o irmão perdido,
do fraternal amor foi comovido.
aos médicos o entrega, e com aviso
o faz estar à cura refusada.
triste, que por tornar-lhe o caro siso
lhe tira a doce vida descansada!
as ervas apolíneas, de improviso,
o tornam à saúde atrás passada.
sesudo, trasilau ao caro irmão
agradece a vontade, a obra não.
porque, despois de ver-se no perigo
dos trabalhos que o siso lhe obrigava,
e despois de não ver o estado antigo
que a vã opinião lhe apresentava,
—ó inimigo irmão, com cor d’amigo!
para que me tiraste (suspirava)
da mais quieta vida e livre em tudo
que nunca pôde ter nenhum sesudo?
por que rei, por que duque me trocara?
por que senhor de grande fortaleza?
que me dava que o mundo se acabara,
ou que a ordem mudasse a natureza?
agora é-me pesada a vida cara;
sei que cousa é trabalho e que tristeza.
torna-me a meu estado, que eu te aviso
que na doudice só consiste o siso.","on the world\'s chaos and confusion (excerpt)
happy the man who never places
his small and humble fantasy
in anything greater than simply leading
his cattle to drink from the cold spring
and drawing their milk so that he can drink!
however fortune may stir things up,
he’ll never feel any greater grief
than the weight of knowing his life is brief.
he’ll see the rising sun’s red face
and see the clear spring always flowing,
not wondering where the water comes from
nor who on the horizon hides the light.
playing the flute where his cattle graze,
he’ll know the grass that covers the hill;
in god he’ll simply and calmly believe,
not pondering truths he can’t conceive.
among the things of antiquity,
it’s written of a certain thrasyllus
that, due to a grave infirmity,
he lost his senses for a long season,
during which time, bereft of reason,
he claimed and believed that all the ships
which at the port of piraeus landed
were ships he owned if not commanded.
he took himself for a mighty lord
and enjoyed as well a happy life,
since he lost nothing when ships were lost,
and rejoiced for those that landed safely.
time went by till one day crito
his brother returned after a long absence
and, seeing how thrasyllus had lost his wits,
was moved by fraternal love to pity.
he gave him to doctors, charging them
to perform the cure thus far refused.
alas! by restoring his brother’s senses,
he robbed him of his sweet easy life!
the herbs of apollo, without delay,
gave him back his former health.
now of sound mind, thrasyllus thanked
his brother for caring, not for his act.
for when he saw himself in danger
of the toils that sanity would impose
and saw no more that state of privilege
conferred on him by his fantasy,
he sighed: “o enemy brother, pretended
friend, why did you take from me
that life so calm and free of pains,
which can’t be had by anyone sane?
“what king, or duke or mighty lord
would i have wished to trade places with?
what did i care if the world ended
or if nature’s order suddenly changed?
now dear life is a heavy burden,
for i know what toil and sadness are.
restore me to that state of bliss;
the only sane condition is madness.”",pt_XX,en_XX,"On the world's discord (excerpt)
whoever had such a low fantasy,
that never in greater things he'd meddle,
but only in leading his flock to the cold fountain
and milking it for the milk he'd drink!
how blessed he would be!
for, however fortune might turn,
he would never feel greater sorrow
than regretting his life's brevity.
he would see the sun lift its purple face,
see the clear spring flow always,
without imagining the source from which it springs,
nor who hides the light on the horizon.
playing the flute as his flock grazes,
he would know the herbs on the high mountain;
he would believe in god, simple and quiet,
without further speculating on any secret.
of a certain trasilaus it's read and written,
among the things of old antiquity,
that he lost his wit for a long time
due to a great ailment;
and while, outside himself, he was mad,
he stubbornly held and believed as truth,
that the ships that sailed were his,
all those anchored in the port of pireus.
he would be greatly esteemed
(além da vida alegre que passava),
since in those that were lost he didn't lose,
and from those that returned safe he rejoiced.
but it didn't take much time before,
a cry, his brother, who had been absent,
arrived to the land; and seeing his lost brother,
he was moved by fraternal love.
he hands him to doctors, and with advice
he makes him subject to refused cure.
sad, to restore his dear wit,
he takes his sweet life in rest!
the apollonian herbs, all of a sudden,
restore his health from the past.
wise, trasilaus to his dear brother
thanks the will, not the deed.
because, after seeing himself in the danger
of the troubles that wit obliged him,
and after not seeing the old state
that the vain opinion presented to him,
—ó brother enemy, with friend's look!
why did you take me out (he sighed)
of the quietest and freest life
that never could have any wise man?
for what king, for what duke did you exchange me?
for what lord of great fortress?
what does it matter to me if the world ends,
or that the order changes the nature?
now my dear life is heavy;
I know what trouble and sadness are.
return me to my state, and I tell you
that in madness alone the wit resides.",0

"o caminho de ohrid*
do alto das muralhas de ohrid onde
acorrera aos gritos desvairados dos vigias,
o rei samuel avistou o seu exército desfigurado,
arrastando-se entre as montanhas da macedónia.
aos catorze mil homens tinham sido
arrancados os olhos por ordem do imperador
e a um em cada cem mandara ele, basílio ii,
fosse poupado um olho para conduzirem o regresso
dessa manada cega. depois de atravessarem altas neves
vinham-se agora despenhando para o lago,
tropeçando, agarrados uns aos outros,
a tortura espelhada nas contorções das faces,
o sangue a empapar-lhes os andrajos. e o rei,
tomado pela angústia, deu um grito de dor e morreu
no alto da muralha sobre a colina e os seus bosques e pomares
que o lago placidamente reflectia.
nesse instante compreendeu como era ambígua
a força cega do destino e em nenhum mosteiro
podia a iconostase explicar-lhe esse cruel mistério:
os santos, com feições dos retratos do fayoum,
entre as chamas trémulas emudeciam
nos seus frescos e as vozes dos jovens monges,
no seu canto austero e imperturbado,
elevavam uma grave primavera na penumbra.","the road to ohrid*
from the heights of the walls of ohrid
to where he’d run upon hearing the screams
of the look-outs, king samuel beheld his disfigured
army dragging through the macedonian mountains.
the eyes of the fourteen thousand men had been
gouged by order of the emperor, basil the second,
who had instructed that one eye be spared in every
hundredth man so that they could lead the return
of that blind herd. having crossed over the high snows
they now came rushing down toward the lake,
stumbling and grabbing on to one another,
the torture mirrored in their facial contortions,
blood soaking their tattered clothes, and the king,
seized by anguish, uttered a shout of grief and died
on the heights of the walls over the hill and his forests and groves
which the lake so peacefully reflected.
in that instant he understood just how ambiguous
the blind force of destiny was, and in no monastery
could the screens of icons have elucidated that cruel mystery:
the saints, whose faces resembled fayumic portraits,
remained silent in their frescos amid the flickering
flames, and the voices of the young monks,
in their austere and unyielding chant,
were lifting up a grave spring in the shadows.",pt_XX,en_XX,"The Path of Ohrid*

tão de dentro falar, tão apagadamente?

outros nós na garganta, mais pensados a frio, outras intensidades
sacudidas, mais distantes da emoção imediata,

the coffee mill appears in some

mill turned everything into fine ground
powder that clogged the most intimate gears,
those of passion and lament, or the linear
calligraphy of half-profiles and azure-blue birds.
later the coffee mill ground up the representation
which became unrecognizable and gave
way to a music of spirals
less rotary, to a memory
less angular, to a periphery
less dear to cézanne, to a nature

perseguições, e nos casos desvairados de amor não há saída.

em que alguém vai morrer, alguém se perde alucinado,
e alguém se salva e porventura alguém escreve

treachery and death, or it must renounce in the face of the most
sublime flashes. passion rudely lacerates people
attached to happiness. the obstacles we meet

feverish pursuits. and in desperate cases of love there’s no way out.

contra a dor o dreno das nossas vidas.
lembramos os pequenos oráculos da infância,
os sonhos que são memórias já na sua escura
torre do tombo, ao intimarmos, no sossego

against grief the conduit of our lives.

the dreams filed away in memory’s dark

we plumb the past’s evasive soul. we seek
in yesterday a compensation, knowing

que alguma coisa fica para sempre nos dias

num pouco de água ou em muita água

as i say ocean as i say woman

but are perhaps a way of liking

and a pleasure in saying so

I know that I like the sea know that I like the woman
and when I say the sea the woman
I don't say sea or woman just for saying
when I say the sea the woman
I think there is a certain tone in my voice I feel a certain aftertaste in my mouth
that show that more than words used to speak
to say as I say the woman the sea
sea woman said this way
they are perhaps a way to like
and the awareness of liking
and a pleasure in saying it
a liking for liking
finally the sea the woman
it may in one case be a sea woman
perhaps just a way to standardize the definite article
in the singular
there are waves in the sea
the sea breaks in waves spread over the long hair of the woman
that she makes better undulate in the afternoons
in September during high tides
the best of the woman perhaps the gaze
is for me the sea of the woman
and to the woman whom I encounter only once in life
in passing a simple moment at some place
perhaps many kilometers from the sea
but woman whom I can't forget
even immersed in pain or submerged in cares
to that certain woman
I call sea woman
at the ends of September when I leave
from a city whichever it may be
when I sense that someone dies
that something stays forever in the days
and whether in eyes or in water
in a little water or in much water
wave of the sea tear or shine of the gaze
I seriously fear I might come to be submerged
I will say aloud or softly as I can
with my whole mouth or already struggling to swallow
the words sea or woman
with a certain vagueness and more and more slowly
woman sea
then almost only thinking
the sea the woman
I don't know but it will be
perhaps more than any other thing
a way to say goodbye",0
"o último poeta romano
enquanto rebentam as ondas junto às praias,
e há troar de canhões além dos muros da cidade,
queria o direito a uma hora indulgente e fugaz,
num espaço inviolável,
guardado pelas asas da musa e os provérbios da sibila
como o actor recolhido aos bastidores do teatro.
esquecidos os sonhos da cabeça adornada por folhas de louro
ou os canapés onde se alongam as últimas almas epicuristas,
num sossego adverbial, em que nada mais ouvisse,
tudo ele pudesse guardar, no âmbito da sua arte,
com a leveza que deixa a pluma ao roçar o papel.
purificada, ao salivá-la como hóstia sob a língua,
cada palavra tivesse a autoridade da grinalda
ou do selo real
e estreitasse numa sebe o mundo que conheceu,
enquanto tudo se gentiliza e desmorona à sua volta.
nesse trabalho de falcoaria sobre o tempo ido,
escrever lembra-lhe os cortes feitos pela navalha
do prisioneiro na parede da cela, contando os dias,
certo de esperá-lo o nó corrediço da forca
ou o tiro disparado de frente sobre o crânio.
sabendo todo o seu trabalho entregue nessa hora
à dispersão,
deseja salvar, consoladora e suficiente,
palavra sua na face de uma estela futura.","the last roman poet
as waves break over the beaches
and cannons boom beyond the city walls,
he asks for one fleeting, indulgent hour
in an inviolable place,
shielded by the muse’s wings and the sibyl’s words

forgetting the dream of a laurel-crowned head
and the couches that cradle the last epicurean souls,
he longs only for adverbial quiet – not a sound –
in which all might be preserved, in the ambit of his art,
with the lightness of a quill passing over paper.
that each word, purified, rolling on the tongue
like a host, might have the authority of a garland
or royal seal
and press the world he knew into a hedge
as everything degenerates and collapses around him.
in this work of falconry applied to time past,
writing reminds him of the notches the prisoner
cuts in the wall of his cell to count the days,
knowing what will come: the slipknot of the gallows
or a shot fired straight into his brain.

assomas no arco da porta com teu rosto de cera
e seguras o colar num gesto extravagante,
defendida de mais uma piada suburbana.
“espera-te o museu”, ia dizer, numa derrisão fatal.
a palavra é recolher sem perda de tempo
e tudo receber com uma última aclamação.
rufam tambores, querida, como nos tempos
antigos, ébrios de sangue, chamando-nos
à cerimónia sacrificial. o rosto que nos promete
o televisor, vê, tem algo de ancestral e terrífico
quando o vemos a meio da fatídica arenga.
mutismo. em casa não temos almofada de joelhos
e a segurança, já o sabemos, é o teu sonho preferido,
se te debruças para os toldos e a linha da água.
vais até à varanda como testemunha ocular dos fogos
que se acendem, inelutavelmente, na distância.
vejo como o medo em ti cinzela uma estátua
de olhar velado e face muda, inexpressiva,
recolhida, como estás, dentro de ti,
ao esconderijo mais abstruso de todos.
2
chegados um ao outro, felizes se ouvimos
um ruído clamoroso na distância, olhamo-nos,
pois cumprida é a promessa, o sacramento
de ordem com que fomos investidos pelo tempo.
que fazer, perguntas. içar o velame
ou escavar em casa a galeria de mina,
desertando os dois, por um fuso horário,
na descida para os antípodas do mundo?
tomar um revulsivo ou deixarmo-nos ir,
movidos pelo vento, sob a aba dos telhados?
nada poderás levar, num último arrebatamento.
tu mesma serás presa, na tarde momentosa,
de quando foi desejo teu e perdes sem apelo
sob a lei da plebe ou uma qualquer ordem
pretoriana, sentenciada ao motivo bíblico
e à resignação de uma existência romana.
hoje tens só a imitação do teu rosto
no espelho. e nada mais te cumpre defender
à hora de sublevarem-se as obras de deus
(além do olhar, vê, tens ainda o mundo inteiro . . .).","de temporum fine comoedia

you loom in the doorway with your waxen face,
flamboyantly clutching your necklace
like a shield against one more suburban joke.
“rehearsing for the museum?” i thought to shoot.
the order of the day is to retreat in haste
and to salute everything with a last hurrah.
drums are rolling, dear, as in olden times, drunk
with blood, calling us to the sacrificial rite.
there’s something ancestral and terrifying
about the face the television promises, look,
in the middle of its ominous harangue.
no comment. we don’t have kneeling pads
at home, and if you lean out to the umbrellas along
the shore, we know security is your preferred dream.
you go to the balcony as an eyewitness of the fires
inevitably blazing in the distance.
i see how fear chisels in you a statue
with veiled gaze and a speechless,
expressionless face, withdrawn into you,
the most recondite hiding place of all.
2
together now, happy if we hear a racket
in the distance, we look at each other,
for the promise is fulfilled, the ritual
sacrament conferred on us by time.
what should we do, you ask. hoist the sails
or dig a mine shaft in the floor, deserting
who we are as we descend time’s tunnel
to reach the world’s antipodes?
swallow a pill or let ourselves go,
pushed by the wind, beneath the eaves?
you cannot, in a final rapture, take anything.
you’ll be the prey, on that crucial day,
of all you desired and lose, without appeal,
under mob rule or some praetorian
order, sentenced to biblical logic
and the resignation of roman existence.
all you have today is your face’s imitation
in the mirror. and that’s all you'll have to defend
in the hour when god's creation rebels (and beyond
your gaze – look! – there's still the whole world . . .).",pt_XX,en_XX,"from the comedy of the end of time
1
sum your waxen face on the threshold's arch
and hold the necklace in an extravagant gesture,
guarded from another suburban jest.
""a museum awaits you,"" I'd say, in a fatal sneer.
the word is to collect without delay
and embrace all with a final acclaim.
drums roll, dear one, as in ancient times,
blood-soaked, summoning us to the sacrificial ceremony.
the television's face, look, has something of the ancient and the terrifying
when we see it mid its fatal harangue.
mute. at home we have no kneepad
and security, we know, is your dream cherished,
when you lean over the awnings and the waterline.
you go to the balcony as an eyewitness to the fires
that ineluctably blaze in the distance.
I see how fear in you carves a statue
with veiled gaze and mute, inexpressive face,
recollected, as you are, within yourself,
to the most abstract hideaway of all.
2
reached to each other, happy we hear
a clamorous noise from afar, we look at each other,
for fulfilled is the promise, the sacrament
of order with which time vested us.
what to do, you ask. raise the sail
or excavate at home the gallery of the mine,
deserting the two, for a time zone,
in the descent to the antipodes of the world?
take an emetic or let ourselves go,
borne by the wind, under the eaves of the roofs?
nothing will you be able to carry, in a last spasm.
you yourself will be captured, in the momentous afternoon,
when it was your desire and you lose without appeal
under the law of the common people or any order
praetorian, sentenced to a biblical motive
and the resignation of a Roman existence.
today you have only the imitation of your face
in the mirror. and nothing else you must defend
when the works of god rise up
(beyond the gaze, see, you still have the entire world...).",0

and learns to divide it among the days

children that the wind victimizes,
my virtual victims now victims of my eyes that now don't see them,
children in crisis sprinkled with dust,
pure dust in the turbulent wind for a moment,
children that a single thought can carry away,
children who are defined by growth,
who sometimes fully contain themselves in contentment,
children reeds bending lightly in the wind,
children of the moment who now concentrate here,
now stand up there always oblivious to themselves,
children almost weightless almost without feet,
swaying on the stalks in the wind
like by enchantment sometimes wrapped in their cloak,
children things almost thought only,
things about which there is sometimes doubt,
that one hardly knows if they are or are not,
that sometimes seem to be and sometimes seem not to be,
that are alive perhaps victims of doubt,
children little more than doubts,
that were here that are not here now,
that even when they were here they were not present,
that at most perhaps they might have been here,

three or four notes of the time of the wind,

"a flor da solidão

"o jogo do chinquilho
renasce neste largo a minha infância
a minha vida tem aqui nova nascente
e jorra de repente com o ímpeto do início
o tempo não passou ou só a consciência
que provisoriamente sinto de voltar alguns anos atrás
a sensação que sei de reflectir sobre esse tempo
de ser um espectador de sucessivos sucedidos dias
de não viver apenas não viver sem sequer saber que vivo
num espaço demarcado onde as coisas e os homens
eram tanto que eram simplesmente
só essa consciência e sensação me fazem suspeitar
de que passou o tempo que nunca passou

o ruído das malhas os paulitos
o sol poente sobre si redondo como simples
malha atirada por alguém pelo espaço do dia
e prestes a cair no mar como nas tábuas

a malha como quem num gesto joga a vida
as silhuetas hirtas dos que assistem
de boné ou barrete na cabeça e mãos nos bolsos

como se aqui ninguém houvesse envelhecido
nem sofrido ou morrido ou suportado
toda a imensa fome requerida para produzir um rico
como se aqui ninguém tivesse demandado
longe de aqui o seu país noutros países
tudo é o mesmo adro a mesma tarde o mesmo jogo
até este café onde sentado olho e penso por olhar
é afinal o mesmo onde bebi a meias com meu pai
a primeira cerveja uma cerveja vinda
através do calor do dia de verão
nesse cesto de vime nesse poço mergulhado
é o mesmo o sabor que sempre sinto nesta boca
há muitos anos já mordendo o vinho o pão a vida
o sabor das mulheres das raparigas
inacessíveis sempre como um absoluto
sempre impossível tido no entanto por possível
o sabor da derrota ou o sabor da terra
sensível dia a dia nos meus dedos
e um dia susceptível de me encher a boca para sempre
envelheci eu sei e só ganhei
o que perdi. sou de uma adulta idade
e entretanto tudo a noite rodeou e o jogo acabou
e pelo céu do tempo houve um homem que passou

in this square my childhood resurrects
here my life suddenly has a new wellspring
and surges with the force it had when it started
the time hasn’t passed only my consciousness
which i feel temporarily transported back a few years
only my familiar sensation of reflecting on that time
of being a spectator of the succession of succeeding days
of not just living of not living without even knowing i live
in a delimited space where things and people
evidently were because they simply were
only that consciousness and sensation make me suspect
that the time that never passed has passed

the clatter of the quoits the iron stakes
the sun setting on itself and round like a simple
quoit tossed by someone through the space of the day
and ready to fall into the sea as onto a stake
the extravagant and thoughtless act of tossing
the quoit as if in that act life itself were at stake
the stock-still profiles of those who look on
with caps on their heads and hands in their pockets
it all happened it happens here thirty-five years ago
as if here no one had gotten old
or suffered or died or endured
the enormous hunger needed to produce one rich man
as if no one here had gone in search of his country
in countries far far away from here
it’s the very same churchyard same afternoon same quoits
even this café where i sit watching and watch with my thinking
is the same café where i split my first beer
with my father a beer that resisted
the heat of the summer day
in that wicker basket submerged in that well
it’s the same taste i’ve had in my mouth
for many years now chewing wine and bread and life
the taste of women the taste of girls
forever inaccessible like any absolute
forever impossible yet pursued as if possible
the taste of defeat or the taste of palpable
earth day by day running through my fingers
and one day bound to fill my mouth forever
i’ve aged i know and all i’ve gained
is what i lost. i’m a grown-up now.

with a cap or beret on their heads and hands in their pockets

nor suffered or died or endured

mas quem sabe quem sabe quando há engano
nos escritórios do inferno? quem poderá dizer
que não era para príncipe ou julgador de povos
o ímpeto primeiro desta criação
irrisória para o mundo – com mundo nela?
tantas preocupações às donas de casa – e aos médicos – ele dava!
como brincar ao bem e ao mal se estes nos faltam?

and ran over it with the wheel by which, eye to eye,

da felicidade; na obsessão dos pescadores de ostras
um derradeiro uivo de sofrimento . . . ” e as palavras chegavam-me
em tumulto, numa pesada respiração, num estertor
de velho. então, vi o fim: a queda sinuosa dos astros, o rosto
de um gelo azul, o ruído de ondas sobrepondo-se à imagem
do ventre rasgado até às entranhas. nenhum exorcismo me restituiu
a força. entrei na procissão dos sonâmbulos,
juntando a voz ao gemido comum. “ – quem é este?” –
“ – o taciturno poeta, o antigo portador de absolvição.”

se quiseres fazer azul,
pega num pedaço de céu e mete-o numa panela grande,
que possas levar ao lume do horizonte;
depois mexe o azul com um resto de vermelho
da madrugada, até que ele se desfaça;
despeja tudo num bacio bem limpo,
para que nada reste das impurezas da tarde.
por fim, peneira um resto de ouro da areia
do meio-dia, até que a cor pegue ao fundo de metal.
se quiseres, para que as cores se não desprendam
com o tempo, deita no líquido um caroço de pêssego queimado.
vê-lo-ás desfazer-se, sem deixar sinais de que alguma vez
ali o puseste; e nem o negro da cinza deixará um resto de ocre
na superfície dourada. podes, então, levantar a cor
até à altura dos olhos, e compará-la com o azul autêntico.
ambas as cores te parecerão semelhantes, sem que
possas distinguir entre uma e outra.
assim o fiz – eu, abraão ben judá ibn haim,

if you wish to make the colour blue
take a piece of sky and put it in a pot
large enough to place on the flame of the horizon.
stir into the blue a pinch of early morning red
until it dissolves. pour everything
into a brass bowl that has been well washed
to eliminate all of the afternoon’s impurities.
finally, sift in a few smidgens of gold from the sand
of midday until the colour adheres to the bottom of the bowl.
to prevent the colours from separating with time,
drop a charred peach pit into the liquid.
it will disintegrate, leaving no telltale
sign, not even – from the black ash – an ochre trace
on the golden surface. you may then raise the colour
to eye level and compare it with genuine blue.
the two colours will look so alike
that you cannot distinguish one from the other.

over time, add to the liquid a burned peach pit.

I arrive by the sea, of its waves,
of the tides that September enfuriates, of the grays
and blues that alternate with strange greens;
a voice speaks of madness, or the vacant gaze
of the fish, or a theme as dry as the algae
of low tide; a wind swept across the beach,
in the silence of the afternoon, returning to the body of the waters
an ancient unity. the sea, however, supposes
that they forget it. in its depths sleep the images
that the dream no longer holds; arms clinging
to the masts of the shipwreck. an abstract boat
passed slowly by the horizon unseen by the morning,
entering the other side of the earth, forgotten
for a moment of the music of the ports. the poem, they told me,
ignored that distraction: it crossed
the limit of eternity, dressed itself with the nocturnal words,
let death contaminate it.
By the sea, I don't notice this; and I say it,

In the matter—in the metaphor—
Necessary, and light, to each one
Where it echoes and slides.

The sound that develops within it
When pronounced,
Is an exalted fragrance
Lost in the storm,
A magnificent minimal entity
Shedding lightning

feroz sorriso, os dentes,

e das ardentes pedras que tem dentro de si.

e sente-se o espírito imortal do amor
criando a carne em extremas atmosferas, acima
de todas as coisas mortas.

e a coisa amada é uma baía estanque.
é o espaço de um castiçal,

das mulheres sentadas.
transforma-se em noite extintora.
porque o amador é tudo, e a coisa amada
é uma cortina
onde o vento do amador bate no alto da janela
aberta. o amador entra
por todas as janelas abertas. ele bate, bate, bate.
o amador é um martelo que esmaga.

ele entra pelos ouvidos, e depois a mulher
que escuta
fica com aquele grito para sempre na cabeça
a arder como o primeiro dia do verão. ela ouve
e vai-se transformando, enquanto dorme, naquele grito
do amador.
depois acorda, e vai, e dá-se ao amador,
dá-lhe o grito dele.
e o amador e a coisa amada são um único grito
anterior de amor.
e gritam e batem. ele bate-lhe com o seu espírito
de amador. e ela é batida, e bate-lhe
com o seu espírito de amada.
