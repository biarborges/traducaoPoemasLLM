"tempo circular
na sombra das folhas de nossos passos
sob um manto de nuvens o dia escureceu; o outono
gerou e apagou novas e efémeras
constelações, e à janela, olhando os cumes nevados ao
longe envoltos no orvalho de um doce sofrimento,
nossos olhos envelheceram; as nossas lembranças e aqueles
que amámos teceram palavras esquecidas; e a vida,
seguindo e caindo sem fim, pareceu apagar-se
como espuma numa recordação fugaz, um bloco de gelo,
transparente, esculpindo e transformando os aspectos do tempo ou
que os gansos agarravam com as asas as frágeis
penas do seu ser, as faziam estilhaçar.
mas era justamente por os anos passados pesarem
sobre nós, voltarem, ou desaparerem, que as terras e os
vales se sentia que suspiravam, que marcavam grãos de areia
no rosto, como outrora em connemara; que se sentia que a natureza
estava prestes a transformar-se, que a nossa sombra estava
prestes a desaparecer; que a neve caía, ia caindo, a neve dos teixos
deixando passar a neve; e que o inverno chegava com
as suas raízes escoradas pela água, e que a ronda do ano
dava outra volta fortuita na charneca, outra volta
na primavera e no verão; outro sopro do seu espírito, como um
gerânio que as pétalas desenham num curso incessante, invisível, e caíssem
na cratera da inocência, dos que vivem, dos que morrem.","circular time
in the leafed shadows of our footsteps
under a mantle of cloud, the day darkened; autumn
crafted and wiped out new and ephemeral
constellations, and by the window, reaching out to distant
snow dusted peaks robed in sweet suffering dew,
our eyes grew old; our memories and those
we loved weaved a forgotten word; and life,
ever returning, and ever falling, seemed to vanish
like foam or a brief remembrance, an ice block,
transparent, shaping and changing the faces of time, or
like a shattering of fragile wings, were the geese
to try and grab it in full flight.
but it was precisely because the passing of the years
weighing on us was coming back or disappearing, that the lands and
the valleys were heard sighing, were allowed to leave the grains of sand
on their face, like long ago in connemara; nature
seemed to be about to transform, our shadow was
about to disappear; the snow was falling, kept falling, the yew snow
letting the snow through; and winter arrived with
its roots dipped in water, and the turn of the year
went yet fortuitously round the heath,
through spring, and summer; another breath of its spirit like
a geranium whose petals drew an incessant, invisible path, and fell
into the crater of innocence of those who live, of those who die.",pt_XX,en_XX,"Circular Time
In the shadow of the leaves of our steps
Under a mantle of clouds the day darkened; autumn
Generated and erased new and ephemeral
Constellations, and by the window, looking at the snow-capped peaks in the distance
Enveloped in the dew of a sweet suffering,
Our eyes aged; our memories and those we loved
Wove forgotten words; and life,
Following and falling without end, seemed to fade
Like foam in a fleeting memory, an ice block,
Transparent, sculpting and transforming the aspects of time or
That the geese caught with their wings the fragile
Feathers of their being, made them shatter.
But it was precisely because the past years weighed
Upon us, returned, or vanished, that the lands and the
Vales it felt they sighed, marked grains of sand
On the face, as once in Connemara; that it felt that nature
Was about to transform, that our shadow was
About to disappear; that the snow fell, was falling, the snow of the hollies
Letting the snow pass; and that winter came with
Its roots supported by water, and that the round of the year
Gave another fortuitous turn on the moor, another turn
In spring and summer; another breath of its spirit, like a
Geranium whose petals draw an endless, invisible course, and fell
Into the crater of innocence, of the living, of the dying.",1
"promontório
sempre busquei a profusão das chuvas

após anos de retiro, lumes brandos, luz de círios,
decorrido que foi o langor de sons pela geada, que
bem remanesce no contorno puído de cidades
– que graça confessamos ter decididamente tocado?
viemos de longe, de patíbulos que ninguém contará,
evocando pontos brumosos e vagas escolhas,
a custo apartados da dor de uma época a outra sobrepondo-se,
para ver enfim esquivas as mansardas donde partimos
– ainda a maioria sorria nos terreiros, tantos anos –
e perceber que o caminho se faz lançando mão
ao que dele continuamente resvala, inaudível – apagando-se.
o tempo vai sendo abolido, é o tempo da chama sobre a água,
e fomos amiúde derivando do maior para o mais justo,
imersos no ruído de fundo de uma escadaria,
pouco a pouco premindo a vida ao tamanho último,
a essa porção da biografia toda a vez mais nítida,
na qual só um recolhimento, tal a subir-se um vão de escada,
é a raiz do que em favor de nós fizemos,
a alegria que emana após o cativeiro.","what tiny, quivering impulse do we never quite forget?

after the torpor of sounds covered by frost

with hazy junctures and choices written in our faces,
caught between the pain of one age and the next,

is the essence of what we did in our own favor,
the happiness emerging in the wake of our captivity.",pt_XX,en_XX,"What minute impulse moves and we don't forget?

Remains in the worn outline of cities

We came from afar, from gallows that no one will count,
Evoking foggy points and vague choices,
Struggling separated from pain as one era overlaps another,
To finally see elusive the attics from which we left
– even then the majority smiled in the courtyards, so many years –
And realize that the path is made by seizing
What continuously slips from it, inaudible – fading.
Time is being abolished, it's the time of the flame on the water,
And we often drifted from the greater to the more just,
Immersed in the background noise of a staircase,
Little by little pressing life to the last size,
To this portion of biography increasingly clear,
In which only a withdrawal, like ascending a stairwell,
Is the root of what we did in our favor,
The joy that emanates after captivity.",1
"twilight
uma mulher estava nos cuidados intensivos
enevoada em suas ligaduras
e tubos nas narinas e nas mãos
que se agitavam e tudo era metálico,
mas ela, a retalhada,
era só tempo incerto, interrogado e trôpego,
só gemido sem voz quando o homem ansioso
se debruçava na contagem dos segundos,
mas ela, a gotejante,
era um puro intervalo numa frouxa fronteira,
só um peso de pálpebras e noite espessa, quando ele, debruçado,
murmurava as palavras, as que ela não ouvia.
terminada a visita, um olhar de relance, um último
desse dia, cercou-a de silêncios pensativos.
a interrogação, a negação da esperança, são como a rosa negra
das condições da esperança.
despiu a bata branca obrigatória, foi-se devagar
e guardou-lhe o rosto translúcido envolto em gazes leves.
há quanto tempo foi? em que lugar, em que manhã furtiva da memória?
quem era o homem? que palavras proferia?
hoje não sei. é como ver da rua uma figura entre cortinas
numa corrente de ar, às vezes penso que era eu,
mas pergunto também, seria alguém por mim, numa curva do tempo,
a murmurar tão baixo palavras esquecidas?
mas se não era eu, como é que soube dessa voz comovida
a resvalar assim até ser inaudível
fora do coração? e se era eu, como pude
tão de dentro falar, tão apagadamente?
porque eu procuro outros andamentos do mundo,
outros nós na garganta, mais pensados a frio, outras intensidades
sacudidas, mais distantes da emoção imediata,
e nunca mais diria palavras tão obscuras.
não interessa quem era. os mares, os ventos
rolaram e rodaram e foram erodindo verdades, circunstâncias.

a woman lay in intensive care
in a fog of bandages with tubes
entering her nostrils and hands,
which twitched, and it was all metallic,
but she, the cut and punctured,
was just a question of tottering, uncertain time,
just a voiceless moan when the troubled man
leaned over in the countdown of seconds,
but she, the dripper,
was a pure interlude on a weak frontier,
just the weight of eyelids and thick night, when he, leaning over,
murmured the words she didn’t hear.

but i also wonder if someone in my stead, in a fold of time,
might have so softly murmured the forgotten words.
but if it wasn’t me, how did i know about that choked voice
that kept slipping until it could no longer be heard
outside the heart? and if it was me, how could i
have spoken so inwardly, in such a muffled tone?

intensities, more detached from immediate emotion,

aos deuses supúnhamos uma existência cintilante
consubstancial ao mar à nuvem ao arvoredo à luz
neles o longo friso branco das espumas o tremular da vaga
a verdura sussurrada e secreta do bosque o oiro erecto do trigo
o meandro do rio o fogo solene da montanha
e a grande abóbada do ar sonoro e leve e livre
emergiam em consciência que se vê
sem que se perdesse o um-boda-e-festa do primeiro dia –
esta existência desejávamos para nós próprios homens
por isso repetíamos os gestos rituais que restabelecem
o estar-ser-inteiro inicial das coisas –
isto nos tornou atentos a todas as formas que a luz do sol conhece
e também à treva interior por que somos habitados
e dentro da qual navega indicível o brilho","the greeks
to the gods we attributed a dazzling existence
consubstantial with the sea the clouds trees and light
in them the waves’ glinting the foam’s long white frieze
the woods’ secret and soft green the wheat’s tall gold
the river’s meandering the mountain’s solemn fire
and the great dome of resonant weightless free air
emerged as self-aware consciousness
with no loss of the first day’s marriage-and-feast oneness
anxious to have this experience for ourselves
we humans repeated the ritual gestures that re-establish
the initial whole presence of things –
this made us attentive to all forms known by the light of day
as well as to the darkness which lives within us
and in which the ineffable shimmer travels",pt_XX,en_XX,"The Greeks
To the gods we supposed a brilliant existence
Consubstantial to the sea to the cloud to the grove to the light
In them the long white frieze of froth the flutter of the wave
The whispered and secret verdure of the wood the erect gold of the wheat
The meander of the river the solemn fire of the mountain
And the great dome of the sonorous light and free and airy air
They emerged into consciousness that is seen
Without losing the one-birthday-and-festival of the first day -
This existence we desired for ourselves as men
That is why we repeated the ritual gestures that reestablish
The initial being-whole of things -
This made us attentive to all the forms that the sunlight knows
And also to the inner darkness that dwells within us
And within which the indescribable shine sails",1
"poema
faz-se luz pelo processo de eliminação de sombras
ora as sombras existem as sombras têm exaustiva vida própria
não dum e doutro lado da luz mas no próprio seio dela
intensamente amantes loucamente amadas
e espalham pelo chão braços de luz cinzenta
que se introduzem pelo bico nos olhos do homem
por outro lado a sombra dita a luz
não ilumina realmente os objectos
os objectos vivem às escuras
numa perpétua aurora surrealista
com a qual não podemos contactar
senão como os amantes
de olhos fechados
e lâmpadas nos dedos e na boca","poem
light occurs when
shadows are eliminated
shadows are what exist
shadows have their own exhaustive life
not on this or that side of light but in its very heart
intensely loving insanely beloved
and they spread over the ground their arms of gray light
that enter human eyes at the corners
on the other hand the shadow called light
doesn’t illuminate objects really
objects live in the dark
in a perpetual surrealist aurora
which we cannot contact
except the way lovers do
with eyes closed
and lamps in our fingers lamps on our lips",pt_XX,en_XX,"poem
light is made by the process of eliminating shadows
now shadows exist the shadows have an exhaustive life of their own
not on either side of the light but within the very core of it
intensely loved madly adored
and they scatter on the floor limbs of gray light
that seep into the man's eyes through the tips of his fingers
on the other hand the shadow dictates the light
it does not really illuminate the objects
the objects live in the dark
in a perpetual surrealist dawn
with which we cannot connect
except as lovers
with eyes closed
and lamps on the fingers and in the mouth",1

"homenagem a s. joão da cruz
quando colhi os frutos daqueles ramos
que nunca deram sombra, a noite desceu
depressa, sem poente nem crepúsculo: a noite
que já estava dentro de cada fruto
e se fazia mais espessa de cada vez que os meus lábios
tocavam a ácida casca. que noite
começou então? não foi, sem dúvida, a noite
áspera do choro e do canto; nem a noite piedosa
que antecede a madrugada; nem sequer
a noite única do sonho e da insónia, confundindo-se
no curso sonâmbulo dos corpos que o torpor amante
contamina. noite sem fim – porque
não teve um princípio – e definitiva no olhar
cego de um reflexo sem memória: dando
o nome às coisas que nunca o tiveram; e roubando
substância a esses nomes – essa noite
anda pelo meio de mim, entre quem sou
e quem julgo ser, impedindo-me de ver cada um
dos lados em que estou. noite, então,
que caiu onde sempre esteve: amada, desejada,
repudiada repetição do que escrevo
quando escrevo – chamando, apenas,
a chama que não vejo nesse obscuro desejo.","homage to st john of the cross
when i plucked the fruit from those branches
that had never given shade, night fell
quickly, with no sunset or twilight – a night
already present in each fruit
and thicker each time my lips
touched their acid skin. what night
was in progress? surely not the bleak night
of weeping and song, nor the compassionate
night that precedes dawn, nor even
that singular night of dream and insomnia, confounded
in the hypnotic conduct of bodies ruled
by love’s torpor. a night without end, since
it had no beginning, definitive in its blind
stare, a reflection without memory that names
what had been nameless, and from the names
takes substance – this night runs
through the middle of me, between who i am
and who i think i am, preventing me from seeing either
of the sides i occupy. a night that fell, therefore,
where it had always been: a beloved, desired,
rejected repetition of what i describe
whenever i write – the fire i call
but do not see in that dark desire.",pt_XX,en_XX,"Homage to Saint John of the Cross
When I gathered the fruits of those barren branches
That never cast shade, night descended swiftly
Without sunset or twilight: the night
That was already within each fruit
And grew thicker each time my lips
Touched the sour peel. What night
Began then? It was not, without doubt, the harsh night
Of weeping and singing; nor the merciful night
That precedes the dawn; nor even
The singular night of dream and insomnia, confusing
In the somnambulist course of bodies that drowsiness taints.
Endless night – because it had no beginning – and final in the blind
Gaze of a reflection without memory: giving
Names to things that never had them; and taking away
Substance from those names – this night
Wanders within me, between who I am
And who I believe to be, preventing me from seeing either side
Of where I stand. Night, then,
That fell where it always was: loved, desired,
Repudiated repetition of what I write
When I write – calling, only,
The flame I do not see in this obscure desire.",1
