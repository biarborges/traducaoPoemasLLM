"amar!
eu quero amar, amar perdidamente!
amar só por amar: aqui... além...
mais este e aquele, o outro e toda a gente
amar! amar! e não amar ninguém!
recordar? esquecer? indiferente!...
prender ou desprender? é mal? é bem?
quem disser que se pode amar alguém
durante a vida inteira é porque mente!
há uma primavera em cada vida:
é preciso cantá-la assim florida,
pois se deus nos deu voz, foi pra cantar!
e se um dia hei-de ser pó, cinza e nada
que seja a minha noite uma alvorada,
que me saiba perder... pra me encontrar...","to love!
i want to love, to be lost in love!
to love just to love: here... there...
this one, that one, another one,
everyone! to love and not love anyone!
remember? forget? it’s all the same!...
hold on or let go? wrong? or right?
those who say they can love someone
their whole life long are telling a lie!
there is in every life a spring.
when it flowers, it must be sung.
the voice god gave us is for singing!
if i must come to ashes, dust,
nothing, then let my night be a dawn
and let me be lost... to find myself...",pt_XX,en_XX,"To love!

I want to love, to love recklessly!
To love just for the sake of love: here... there...
More this and that, the other and everyone
Love! Love! And not to love anyone!
Remember? Forget? Indifferent!...
Bind or loosen? Is it wrong? Is it right?
Whoever says you can love someone
For the whole life is lying!

There is a spring in every life:
It's necessary to sing it in full bloom,
For if God gave us voice, it's to sing!

And if one day I am to be dust, ashes and nothingness,
That my night becomes a dawn,
That I know how to lose myself... to find myself...",1

"amigos perdidos
os amigos levados pela vida
são os mais difíceis de aplacar, os mais
tiranos. bárbaros de um país desconhecido,
bebem à taça os venenos do silêncio e crescem
desmedidamente na distância, desentendidos
da nossa solidão. e pensar que já fomos
irmãos de armas, que desenterrámos tesouros
nas mesmas ilhas, nos livros
mais inóspitos. como são as coisas.
terá sido tudo em vão? dir-se-ia
que estávamos predestinados às mesmas
canções, a uma espécie mais certa de amor.
pois sim. nem sequer compreendemos
o que nos aconteceu.","lost friends
friends carried off by life
are the most difficult to appease, the most
tyrannical. barbarians of an unknown land,
they sip the poison of silence and they grow
beyond all limits in the distance, a blind eye
to our loneliness. and to think that we were
brothers in arms, that we dug up buried treasure
from the same islands, from the most
barren of books. how things turn out.

that we were destined for the same
songs, for a more certain kind of love.

tyrannical. Barbarians from an unknown land,

uncontrollably in distance, misunderstanding

brothers in arms, who unearthed treasures
on the same islands, in the most inhospitable books.
How things change.

we were predestined to the same

"sempre, cruel senhora, receei,
medindo vossa grã desconfiança,
que desse em desamor vossa tardança,
e que me perdesse eu, pois vos amei.
perca-se, enfim, já tudo o que esperei,
pois noutro amor já tendes esperança.
tão patente será vossa mudança,
quanto eu encobri sempre o que vos dei.
dei-vos a alma, a vida e o sentido;
de tudo o que em mim há vos fiz senhora.
prometeis e negais o mesmo amor.
agora tal estou que, de perdido,
não sei por onde vou, mas algũ’hora
vos dará tal lembrança grande dor.","cruel senhora
cruel senhora, i’ve always been wary. i knew
i needed to watch you closely in case
your doubts would surge to disaffection and erase
our love. then i’d be ruined, since i love only you.
and now, everything i’d hope to have is lost:
you’re pursuing another lover. so i detach
myself, believing your retribution will match
the sacrificial depths my love has cost:
i’ve given my soul, my senses, and my life to you;
i’ve given you everything i have within me,
and you promised love, but now, there’s only disdain.
lost and hopeless, i don’t know what to do,
yet i know the day will come when this memory
will crush you down with terrifying pain.",pt_XX,en_XX,"always, cruel mistress, I feared,
measuring your great mistrust,
that your delay would turn to love's lost,
and that I would be lost, since I loved you.
lose all, at last, that I hoped for,
for in another love you already have hope.
your change will be so evident,
as I always concealed what I gave you.
I gave you my soul, my life, my meaning;
of everything within me you became mistress.
you promise and deny the same love.
now I am so lost that, having lost my way,
I don't know where I go, but some hour
will give you such a memory great sorrow.",1
"alma minha gentil, que te partiste
tão cedo desta vida descontente,
repousa lá no céu eternamente,
e viva eu cá na terra sempre triste.
se lá no assento etéreo, onde subiste,
memória desta vida se consente,
não te esqueças daquele amor ardente
que já nos olhos meus tão puro viste.
e se vires que pode merecer-te
algũa cousa a dor que me ficou
da mágoa, sem remédio, de perder-te,
roga a deus, que teus anos encurtou,
que tão cedo de cá me leve a ver-te,
quão cedo de meus olhos te levou.","dear gentle soul, you that departed . . .
dear gentle soul, you that departed
this life so soon and reluctantly,
rest in heaven eternally
while i remain here, broken-hearted.
if there in the ethereal skies
memories are still allowed to move,
do not forget that ardent love
you once saw shining in my eyes.
and if you judge there might be merit,
however small, in this pain that stays,
grieving with nothing to repair it,
petition god, who cut short your days,
to take me to you, in that reckless spirit
he used to summon you from my gaze.",pt_XX,en_XX,"My gentle soul, that thou didst leave so soon
So early from this life, so discontent,
Rest there in heaven eternally,
And let me live here on earth always sad.
If there in the ethereal seat, where thou hast risen,
Memory of this life is permitted,
Do not forget the ardent love
That in my eyes thou saw so pure.
And if thou seest that I can deserve
Anything from the pain that was left me
From the remedyless grief of losing thee,
Pray to God, who shortened thy years,
That He may soon bring me to see thee,
As soon as He took thee from my eyes.",1
"transforma-se o amador na cousa amada,
por virtude do muito imaginar;

the lover becomes the thing he loves
by virtue of much imagining;
since what i long for is already in me,
the act of longing should be enough.
if my soul becomes the beloved,
what more can my body long for?
only in itself will it find peace,
since my body and soul are linked.

"erros meus, má fortuna, amor ardente
em minha perdição se conjuraram;
os erros e a fortuna sobejaram,
que para mim bastava o amor somente.
tudo passei; mas tenho tão presente
a grande dor das cousas que passaram,
que as magoadas iras me ensinaram
a não querer já nunca ser contente.
errei todo o discurso de meus anos;
dei causa [a] que a fortuna castigasse
as minhas mal fundadas esperanças.
de amor não vi senão breves enganos.
oh! quem tanto pudesse que fartasse
este meu duro génio de vinganças!","my errors, cruel fortune and ardent love . . .
my errors, cruel fortune and ardent love
conspired to bring about my ruin;
the errors and fortune were superfluous,
since love alone would have done as much.
although it’s over, the dreadful pain
of what i suffered is still so vivid
that i, with bitter rage, have learned
never to try to be happy again.
in life and words i’ve always strayed,
giving fortune cause to punish
my poorly founded hopes.
in love i’ve known just brief illusions.
oh! if only my ruthless genius
would have its fill of wreaking vengeance!",pt_XX,en_XX,"My mistakes, bad luck, burning love
Were conjured in my downfall;
Mistakes and fortune were more than enough,
For love alone was all I needed.
I've endured everything; but so vividly present
Is the great pain of things that have passed,
That the wounded anger has taught me
To never again wish to be content.
I erred throughout the course of my years;
I caused fortune to punish
My ill-founded hopes.
From love, I only saw brief deceptions.
Oh! who could satisfy
This harsh nature of mine with vengeance!",1
"busque amor novas artes, novo engenho,
para matar-me, e novas esquivanças;
que não pode tirar-me as esperanças,
que mal me tirará o que eu não tenho.
olhai de que esperanças me mantenho!
vede que perigosas seguranças!
que não temo contrastes nem mudanças,
andando em bravo mar, perdido o lenho.
mas, conquanto não pode haver desgosto
onde esperança falta, lá me esconde
amor um mal, que mata e não se vê.
que dias há que n’alma me tem posto.
um não sei quê, que nasce não sei onde,
vem não sei como, e doi não sei porquê.","may love seek out new arts, devise a plot . . .
may love seek out new arts, devise a plot
to kill me, and discover new disdain;
for robbing me of hope will be in vain,
since it can scarcely take what i’ve not got.
behold the kind of hopes on which i stand!
and see how perilous my certainties!
for i fear neither change nor enmities,
ploughing the sea, lost far from any land.
and yet, although one cannot pay grief’s toll
where hope is gone, still love has hidden there
for me an ill, that kills and can’t be seen;
how long ago did love place in my soul
i don’t know what, born i don’t know where,
come i don’t know how, nor why it aches so keen.",pt_XX,en_XX,"seek love new arts, new cunning,
to kill me, and new evasions;
for it cannot take away my hopes,
which hardly can take away what I do not have.

drifting in a fierce sea, lost the ship.
but, although there can be no sorrow
where hope is lacking, love hides
a malady that kills and cannot be seen.
how many days has it placed in my soul.

o lindo ser de vossos olhos belos,
se não perder a vista só em vê-los,
já não paga o que deve a vosso gesto.

mas eu, por de vantagem merecê-los,
dei mais a vida e alma por querê-los,
donde já me não fica mais de resto.
assi que a vida e alma e esperança
e tudo quanto tenho, tudo é vosso,
e o proveito disso eu só o levo.

whoever, lady, sees plainly on view

without being blinded in the act of seeing

this seems to me an honest price,
but i, for the merit of deserving them,
gave both life and soul to serve them
apart from which i am without resource.
enough that life and soul and hope
and as much as i have is all yours,
and the proof of this i alone know.

he would not pay what your gesture requests.
this seemed to me an honest price;
but I, to gain the advantage of possessing them,
gave more: my life and soul for desiring them,
leaving me nothing else at rest.
thus life and soul and hope are yours,
and all that I possess, I give to you,
and the profit from this, I alone enjoy.
for such great blessedness it is
to give you all I have and all I can

"amor é um fogo que arde sem se ver,
é ferida que doi, e não se sente;
é um contentamento descontente,
é dor que desatina sem doer.
é um não querer mais que bem querer;
é um andar solitário entre a gente;
é nunca contentar-se de contente;
é um cuidar que ganha em se perder.
é querer estar preso por vontade;
é servir a quem vence, o vencedor;
é ter com quem nos mata, lealdade.
mas como causar pode seu favor
nos corações humanos amizade,
se tão contrário a si é o mesmo amor?","love is a fire that burns unseen . . .
love is a fire that burns unseen,
a wound that aches yet isn’t felt,
an always discontent contentment,
a pain that rages without hurting,
a longing for nothing but to long,
a loneliness in the midst of people,
a never feeling pleased when pleased,
a passion that gains when lost in thought.
it’s being enslaved of your own free will;
it’s counting your defeat a victory;
it’s staying loyal to your killer.
but if it’s so self-contradictory,
how can love, when love chooses,
bring human hearts into sympathy?",pt_XX,en_XX,"Love is a fire that burns without being seen,
It's a wound that hurts but isn't felt;
It's a discontented contentment,
It's a pain that raves without hurting.
It's not wanting more than to desire;
It's walking alone among the crowd;
It's never content with being content;
It's a concern that gains by being lost.
It's wanting to be imprisoned by choice;
It's serving the one who beats, the victor;
It's having loyalty to who kills us.
But how can its favor cause
Human hearts to feel friendship,
If love itself is so self-contradictory?",1
