"morticínio ancestral
quando minha avó torcia o pescoço
dos frangos, não raras vezes
chegando a decapitá-los,
e os lançava ao chão frio de cimento
para aquela dança assustadora,
não havia em seu rosto
paixão, prazer, ou pena.
na escuridão escondida dentro do meio-dia,
aqueles morticínios eram os atos
mais honestos na violência
daquela casa e daquela infância.
afogando na água fervente
os cadáveres sem cabeça
[que ficara de banda no quintal
interrogando seu criador],
ela passava a depená-los, ágil,
qual fosse ela um gavião-pedrês.
como o cafuné do crânio da onça
no crânio da capivara,
ou o abraço anelar das garras do carcará
ao redor do corpo todo-torso da cobra,
nada naquela velha
era cogitado
para além da missão simples:
alimentar a prole.
como todo animal que não questiona
a cadeia alimentar diante da fome,
minha avó foi o bicho mais inocente
da minha casa e da minha selva.
mais do que os gatos e pombos,
mais do que os jabutis e coelhos,
com certeza
era mais inocente minha avó
do que as cachorras da casa,
aquelas cachorras grandes e gordas
com os dentes afiados — mas inúteis,
esperando também daquela mamífera-anciã
que manchasse ela as mãos de sangue.","ancestral slaughter
when my grandmother used to wring
the necks of chickens, not infrequently
to the point of decapitation,
and dropped them to the cold cement floor
and that shocking dance,
on her face there was no trace
of passion, pleasure, or pity.
in the darkness hidden within the noonday,
those killings were the most honest acts
in the violence of that house,
that childhood.
after plunging into boiling water
those headless corpses
[who’d stood in brood in the yard
questioning their creator],
she began to pluck them, with all
the agility of a gray-lined hawk.
like the caress of the jaguar’s skull
on the capybara’s, or the annulate
embrace of the caracara’s claws
on a snake’s all-torso body,
nothing in that old woman
was cognized
beyond a simple mission:
to feed her offspring.
as any animal does not question
the food chain in the face of hunger,
my grandmother was of all animals
the most innocent in my house
and in my forest.
more than cats and pigeons,
more than tortoises and rabbits,
this is far more certain:
my grandmother was more innocent
even than our household dogs,
our big, fat dogs
with sharp — but useless — teeth,
also waiting for that age-old mammal
to drench her hands in blood.",pt_XX,en_XX,"ancestral slaughter
when my grandmother twisted the necks
of chickens, not infrequently
decapitating them,
and threw them to the cold concrete floor
for that terrifying dance,
there was no passion, pleasure, or pity on her face.
in the hidden darkness within the midst of the day,
those slayings were the most honest acts
in the violence
of that house and that childhood.
dipping the headless corpses
into the boiling water
[which had been left aside in the yard
questioning their creator],
she would pluck them, agile,
like she was a shikra eagle.
like the caress of the jaguar's skull
on the skull of the capybara,
or the ring-around-the-creature embrace
of the caracara's claws
around the snake's torso,
nothing in that old woman
was considered
beyond the simple mission:
to feed the offspring.
like every animal that doesn't question
the food chain in the face of hunger,
my grandmother was the most innocent beast
of my house and my jungle.
more than the cats and pigeons,
more than the tortoises and rabbits,
for sure
my grandmother was more innocent
than the dogs of the house,
those big and fat dogs
with sharp but useless teeth — waiting
for that mammalian elder
to stain her hands with blood.",2

na hora em que eu mais ruía
o sol aplainava o relvado, palmeiras
ondulavam num lago turvo
longe o escaravelho porvindoiro
que as reduziu a um coto
assemelhando-as a um ananás que degrada hoje
pelos jardins
o repuxo animava sem triunfo o pântano
da juventude
as varandas em fogo
o verão começando pelo fim
horas extraordinárias aquelas
em que as aves adiavam o repouso por causa
dos insectos do turno sequente
ourados absortos estrepitantes
a hora em que mais ninguém deitava como eu
a bicicleta sobre a falta
e se sentava na relva prendendo as lágrimas
as mãos tapando o rosto o rosto entre os geolhos e uma
roda atrás a girar
não havia o ecrã de bolso oportuno
era inevitável encarar o que não tem conserto
nem nunca terá
era do dia o instante altíloquo
uma harmónica crepitava nos auscultadores
feria de morte o touro da tarde
esse búfalo ermo que se aparta da manada
para ficar-se
os subidos candeeiros acendiam
havia um muro recém pintado
sujo já por um grafito de província
um cão passava ao largo levantava o focinho ao
perfume dos jantares
que chegava de onde
se entrevia o espalha-cor dos televisores
havia o farrapo de lua
como flanela posta sobre a ganga das alturas
agraudava os dós arrumados
na caixa do futuro
a hédera das extensões percorria aquela hora
uma ideia sulcava a charneca celeste
o coração alpinista no avesso dos volumes
rarefeito
o mundo era já uma seara de nojo
e fartura – belo desastroso feroz – lugar de forças
e destruições
eu tacteava de olhos fechados
puro intrínseco
procurava um celeiro urbano onde guardar
o ouro-sémen pronto a detonar
a libélula extrema o grilo inicial
a andorinha cujo ninho resulta de um cúmulo
de lama e ervas secas e rasoira
as superfícies alimentando-se no ar
nas minhas costas o exíguo refrigério
da biblioteca pública
àquela hora antro de nebulosos soldados
repousando da luta de guerrilha
hasta la derrota, siempre!
infligiam estragos mínimos a um inimigo
bronco mas relutante
apenas tombavam nas emboscadas aqueles
como eu mais sorumbáticos
tanto oito visível ainda sobre o chão
lavrado à força de rodar no mesmo sítio
ousara trespassar o pórtico do infinito
finava sempre inclinado sobre o jantar","[neil young]
that moment when i was really falling apart
and the sun lingered over the lawn, and the palms
billowed above the turbid lake
faraway the promised beetle
reduced those palms to a stump
until they seemed like a pineapple which these days
rots in the gardens
the fountain blandly animated the swamp
of the young
the balconies on fire
the summer beginning at its end
overtime hours those
in which the birds delayed their naps because
of the next shift of insects
hallucinating self-absorbed clamorous
at that hour no one else like me setting their bicycle
down on the dearth
sitting on the grass holding back tears
covering their face with their hands, face between their knees and a
wheel behind still spinning
there was no convenient pocket screen
facing up to that which can’t be fixed and never will be
was inevitable
it was on that day the eloquent moment
a harmonica crackled in my headphones
mortally wounding the afternoon’s bull
that solitary buffalo that steers clear of the herd
to die
the high lamps lit up
a newly painted wall
already marked with a small town’s graffito
a dog went past lifting its snout to the
scent of dinners
which came from where
the televisions’ color-blend rose in the air
there was the shred of moon
like flannel sewn onto the denim of the heights
it nurtured hoarded hurt
in the box of the future
the ivy of extensions twined through that hour
an idea furrowed the celestial fen
the mountaineer heart inside the volumes
rarefied
the world was already a glebe of lamentation
and overabundance – beautiful disastrous fierce – locus of forces
and ruin
i fingered with my eyes closed
pure intrinsic
searched out an urban granary where i could keep
the semen-gold ready to detonate
the extreme dragonfly the first cricket
the swallow who got up its nest in a cumulus
of mud and dried weeds who smooths
the surfaces feeding itself in the air
at my back the exiguous cooling
of the public library
at that hour a cavern of nebulous soldiers
resting from their war of resistance
hasta la derrota, siempre!
they inflicted little damage on a rough
but reluctant enemy
only those as sullen as i
walked into ambushes
so many figure eights still visible on the ground
forcefully hoed up from repeatedly going round in the same place
i had dared to go past the gate of the infinite
always ending up bent over dinner",pt_XX,en_XX,"[neil young]
at the hour when i was crumbling
the sun smoothed the lawn, palm trees
waved in a murky lake
far away the locust of the future
that reduced them to stubs
making them resemble a pineapple that degrades today
through the gardens
the fountain animated without triumph the swamp
of youth
the balconies ablaze
summer starting from the end
those were extraordinary hours
when the birds postponed rest because of
the insects of the next shift
golden, absorbed, clamorous
the hour when no one else lay down like me
the bicycle on the absence
and sat on the grass holding back tears
the hands covering the face, the face in the knees and a wheel
behind spinning
there was no timely pocket screen
it was inevitable to face what has no fix
nor ever will
it was the day's boastful instant
a harmonica crackled in the headphones
it mortally wounded the bull of the afternoon
that buffalo isolated from the herd
to stay behind
the raised street lamps lit up
there was a freshly painted wall
already sullied by a provincial graffito
a dog passed by far lifting its muzzle to
the scent of dinners
that came from where
the scatter of tv screens was seen
there was a shred of moon
like a flannel placed over the denim of heights
it caressed the arranged do's
in the box of the future
the ivy of extensions traversed that hour
an idea furrowed the celestial heath
the mountaineer heart on the inside of the volumes
thinned out
the world was already a harvest of disgust
and plenty – beautiful, disastrous, fierce – place of forces
and destructions
i felt my way with closed eyes
pure intrinsic
looking for an urban granary to store
the gold-semen ready to detonate
the extreme dragonfly, the initial cricket
the swallow whose nest results from a heap
of mud and dry grass and sickle
surfaces feeding on air
on my back the scant relief
of the public library
at that hour den of nebulous soldiers
resting from guerrilla warfare
hasta la derrota, siempre!
they inflicted minimal damage to an awkward but reluctant enemy
only those like me more sullen
fell in ambushes

"sinal
naquele ano a chuva foi excessiva e cresceram tortulhos
nos olhos dos cães. os vitelos, ao espreitar a luz pelos sexos
das mães, afogavam-se em lama, no meio dos sambos. as paredes
das casas diluíam-se em nata e os oleiros desistiram de encomendar
a sua obra a deus. enormes cuidados foram inventados
para proteger o fogo nos altares e as crianças adoptaram a nudez.
as termiteiras deixaram de existir e as formigas aladas
perderam as asas. os pés dos mais-velhos fenderam-se em chagas
e as mamas das virgens, mal eram tocadas, colavam-se aos dedos
como cinza húmida. os lábios dos sexos das mulheres paridas
inchavam carnudos de uma carne branca e os ventres pendiam
como fruta mole.
naquele ano a chuva foi excessiva
e os horizontes deixaram de existir.
choveu por muito tempo até os cães perderem todo o pêlo
e as cabeleiras se destacarem como algas podres. o rei do jau
ficou colado ao trono e ao boi sagrado cresceram-lhe os olhos,
que depois cegaram. as sementes grelaram nos celeiros
e essa semente assim era servida aos homens e daí lhes ocorreu
um tal vigor que os seus sexos cresceram desmedidos
e os homens vacilaram, tendo-os nas mãos e mudos de fascínio.
a chuva choveu tanto que as serpentes saíram dos buracos
e vieram alongar-se ao pé dos paus, mantendo com esforço
as cabeças erguidas. nas terrinas do leite vicejavam musgos
e o leite das vacas alterou-se em soro, a coalhar na urina.
naquele ano a chuva choveu tanto que até nos areais cresceram
talos e as enxurradas produziram peixe e até o ferro se lavou
sozinho e os diamantes vieram rebolar nas pedras concavadas
de moer farinha. as próprias aves morreram quase todas
e apenas se salvaram as de penas brancas, que a distância atraiu,
depois comeu.
e aquela chuva aproveitou aos fósseis e houve minerais
que se animaram e até pedras comuns a transmudar-se em carne.
naquele ano a chuva choveu tanto que a memória perdeu todo
o sentido. as gargantas entupiram-se de limos
e as testas que os velhos pousavam nas mãos fundiam-se aos dedos
e os braços às pernas e os gestos de graça fundiam os corpos
e as jovens crianças ficavam coladas ao peito das mães.
só as bocas teimavam em manter-se abertas e quando mais tarde
a chuva parou, das bocas saíram grossas aves negras
que abalaram logo daquelas paragens. e a seca voltou
e o mundo secou. a carne antiga a dar-se agora em terra,
os fósseis em pedra e as ramas em húmus.
e os passos poliram pouco a pouco as formas.

that was the year that the rains were excessive and mushrooms grew
in dogs’ eyes. the young bulls, looking out at the light from their mother’s crotches, drowned in the mud, in the middle of the vines. the walls of the houses dissolved in cream and the potters no longer entrusted their work to god. enormous measures were invented
to protect the altar flames and the children started to run around naked.
the termitaries ceased to exist and winged ants lost their wings. the feet of the oldest ones split open in sores and the breasts of virgins, as soon as you touched them, stuck to your fingers like wet ash. the lips of the birthing womens’ sex swelled plumply like white meat and their bellies hung like soft fruit.
that was the year the rain was excessive and the horizon ceased to exist.
it rained forever until the dogs lost all their fur and people’s hair stuck out like rotten seaweed. the king of jau got stuck to his throne and the sacred bullock’s eyes grew larger, and then went blind. the seed sprouted in the granaries and then it was served up to the men, just like that, and they were infused with such vigor that their cocks grew immeasurably and they reeled about, with the things in their hands, mute with the magic.
the rain rained so much that the snakes left their snake-holes
and stretched out next to sticks, raising their heads
with only the greatest effort. moss multiplied in the tureens of milk
and the milk of cows turned to whey which curdled in urine.
that year the rain rained so much that even the beaches grew
branches and the rushing streams spawned fish and even the iron washed itself alone and diamonds started to tumble around the stones hollowed out for milling flour. the birds themselves nearly all died and the only ones that saved themselves were those with white feathers, which the distance attracted, then ate.
and the rain was good for fossils, and there were minerals
that came alive and even common stones that were transmuted into
flesh.
that year the rain rained so much that memory was rendered
meaningless. throats were clogged with sludge and the brows that the aged held in their hands fused with their fingers,
and their arms fused to their legs and their graceful gestures smelt their bodies and the youngest children ended up glued to their mothers’ breasts.
only our mouths dared to remain open and when the rain
finally stopped, huge black birds flew from them and disappeared into the distance. and the drought came back and the world dried out. now the ancient flesh has turned to dirt,
the fossils to stone and the branches to humus.

era a palavra doce a afagar-me por dentro,
as batas todas brancas salpicdas de gouache
colorido e o cinto azul que eu trazia sempre largo
assim a cair de lado à espadachim
as escadas de madeira rangentes
ao compasso dos passos, sentidas ainda
à distância de vinte anos,
todas nós em submissa fila a responder à chamada,
""presente"" parecia-me então lógico e certo
como assistir à oração na capela e ler as epístolas
(de são paulo aos coríntios:
naquele tempo...),
tem uma voz bonita e lê tão bem, e depois
mandavam-me apertar o cinto para ficar
mais composta em cima do banquinho,
à direita do padre
e o fascínio das confissões,
as vozes sussuradas na fina madeira
castanha a esconder uma falta,
o cheiro do chão encerrado e da cera das velas

e comecei a achar que as palavras não prestam
e que era inútil
inútil a teia de madeira

over the sea, looking up ‘gulls’ in the dictionary

writing nous fûmes vous fûtes ils fûrent a hundred times

and red (i have too many globules! faites attention)

pooling beneath the desks,

with x as unknown
ah… beautiful afternoons when it was good
to be good, and neither the little saint nor candy,
but the sweet word fondling me from within,
our white smocks spotted with bright hued gouache
the blue belt i always wore draped
like a swashbuckler
creaking wooden stairs
rhyming to steps
twenty years on,
falling into formation to the roll,
“present” seemed so logical and certain then,
like going to prayers in the chapel and reading the epistles
(saint paul to the corinthians:
in that time…),
you have such a beautiful voice and read so well,
and then they made me tighten my belt,
primped in my pew
to the right of the priest
the pull of the confession,
voices murmuring through the fine wooden web
dissembling defects,
smell of the waxed floor and the wax of the candles

knew words didn’t do any good,
that the wooden web
was useless

de penúria diuturna. passou de leve

sem alaridos da história, e só sobreviveu

com a guerra das gálias e alguns nomes de deuses.

through peristyles, a stranger to luxury, to corruption
to astrology, and no poisoned morsel ever befell him
