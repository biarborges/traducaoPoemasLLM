"uma canção póstuma para paul celan

como o cabelo com o tom escuro dos violinos me escurece, como
escurece o vento nos bosques frios em que morremos, escurecem as alamedas
escurece o leite negro que bebemos e bebemos.
onde vieres também tu pelo adordo sublime do infortúnio, nem que franzido seja o teu sangue
e se teus lábios os vir ao entardecer, à hora mágica, lendo os poemas da galícia — eu regresso — «eu
até nos combóios que cavam um túmulo pelos ares, se te vejo, sulamith — eu «escureço — «e escureço

"a viagem de alexandre à índia
andaste de um ao outro lado da terra na vida interminável,
tiveste degredos, piedosos cíumes, a fé desvanescida,
amantes paradas na lavoura, roubando-te o rosto amado.
viste vestígios de que foste a sombra de ninguém,
olhos sem pudor, do reflexo dos ferros no tropel,
franjas do domínio pueril de alexandre, olhando gaugamela.
partiste num porto de transição para o levante,
com vazios para trás, todo o tempo a poder ver,
e ao primeiro inverno, pelos cardeais das suas cinzas,
começaste a travessia que não termina, a história que não acaba.
soubeste porque se vislumbra, em lágrimas, o pinheiro da juventude,
o nome quebrado num turvo ar medido sem corda,
e a maresia do vento de feição no segundo inverno.
em troca perseguiste o que rege o homem fortuito,
segredando em palácios de mármore que são apenas pedras,
dos fracassos a que jamais alguém ajoelhara.
ao terceiro inverno descobriste o hemisfério, e ao quarto,
sem ideia de guerra ou ordem para mudar o reino,
escolheste adornar os aquedutos sob o manto dos regatos,
sentado, na brisa no tanque, ao febril entardecer.
de quem te aproximaste, no seu trajecto interminado,
sem lugar senão o que esfria na mente recortada,
naquilo que se ramifica, tornando-se na própria teia,
contigo propagou o dever de passar em toda a parte.
e quando veio o quinto inverno, e o sexto, suturaste o sangue,
trouxeste a pele à curva dos rios, acolheste o que de resto se desmorona,
e pudeste enfim, na crença dos migradores furtivos, entender que
tudo se perde noutro lugar ainda, e após esse ainda noutro
e que ao fim de cada manhã noutra manhã
tudo é incerto, tão conforme o dente-de-leão no meio de searas,
tão emudecido como a veia exausta dos não sepultados.
na mansarda onde vagueia o dia e a noite
o vento responde, cortando o centeio e o calcário, e a vela
que brilha na luz de estrelas veladas, já desaparecidas,
pisadas, mudas, engolidas aos pés do sétimo inverno,
arpoa o coração e a ruína — os meridianos despem-se, voam
em vinte e cinco anos que há pouco se beijavam, e seja dito ou não dito
o prazer que inflige um pico de tormentos
por lábios que só as mulheres conhecem
no moinho das águas da morte em varanasi,
sacode a chama de quanto vale, dura e canta
o princípio e o fim do teu poder na terra.","alexandres`s travel to india
you wandered an interminable life across the earth,
suffered exile, piteous jealousy, futile faith,
labour-arrested lovers plundering your beloved’s face.
you saw traces of having been no one’s shadow,
impudent eyes, the reflection of iron on the rampage,
hints of alexander’s puerile dominance, contemplating gaugamela.
you set off from a transient port towards the levant,
leaving emptiness behind, seeing all of time,
and in the first winter, by the cardinals of its ashes,
you started the endless crossing, the incessant history.
you knew, because the pine tree of youth can be glimpsed through tears,
of the shattered name in a cloudy mood measured without ropes,
and of the favourable sea breeze in the second winter.
in exchange you pursued that which rules the fortuitous man,
whispering in marble palaces that are but stones,
failures to which no one had ever knelt.
by the third winter you discovered the hemisphere, and by the fourth,
non intent on war or order to change the kingdom,
you chose to adorn aqueducts with the mantle of streams,
sitting by the pool breeze, in the evening´s lingering fever.
whomever you approached, in their indefinite path,
without a place except that which fades inside a patchy mind,
in that which branches out and becomes the very web,
has spread with you the duty to pass through everywhere.
and by the fifth winter, and the sixth, you stitched up the blood,
brought the skin on to the river bends, welcomed that which falls apart,
and were at last capable, with the belief of a stealthy migrant, of understanding
that all is lost yet in another place, and after this in yet another
and that by the end of each morning in another morning
all is uncertain, just like a dandelion in a field of wheat,
as muted as the exhausted vein of the unburied.
in the attic where night and day roam
the wind replies, cutting the chalk and the rye, and the candle,
shimmering in the light of the veiled stars already gone,
trodden, voiceless, swallowed up by the seventh winter,
spears the heart and the ruin — the meridians undress, fly away
in twenty five years that were just kissing yesterday, and be it told or untold
the pleasure that brings a peak of torment, inflicted
by lips that only women know
in the turmoil of varanasi´s death waters,
tests the flame of the merit, endurance and song of
the beginning and the end of your power on earth.",pt_XX,en_XX,"The journey of alexander to india
you've traveled from one end of the earth to the other in endless life,
you've had banishments, pious jealousies, faith that faded away,
lovers standing still in the fields, stealing your beloved's face.
you've seen traces that you were the shadow of no one,
eyes without shame, the reflection of the iron in the rush,
fringes of the petty realm of alexander, watching gaugamela.
you left from a transitional port towards the east,
with emptiness behind, all the time to look back,
and by the first winter, by the cardinal points of its ashes,
you began the crossing that never ends, the story that doesn't end.
you knew why the pine of youth is glimpsed in tears,
the name broken in a murky air measured without a string,
and the brine of the wind in its mood in the second winter.
in exchange you pursued what governs the casual man,
whispering in marble palaces that are merely stones,
of the failures to which no one had ever kneeled.
by the third winter you discovered the hemisphere, and by the fourth,
without an idea of war or order to change the realm,
you chose to adorn the aqueducts under the mantle of brooks,
sitting in the breeze by the tank, at feverish dusk.
with whom you drew close, in their endless path,
without a place but what chills the cut mind,
in what branches out, becoming the web itself,
with you the duty to pass everywhere was propagated.
and when the fifth and sixth winters came, you staunched the blood,
you brought the skin to the curve of the rivers, embraced what else collapses,
and you could finally, in the belief of the stealthy migrants, understand that
everything is lost somewhere else, and after that somewhere else again
and that at the end of each morning there is another morning,
everything is uncertain, as the dandelion in the midst of fields,
as silent as the vein exhausted of the unburied.
in the attic where day and night wander
the wind responds, cutting the rye and limestone, and the sail
that shines in the light of veiled stars, already gone,

in twenty-five years that recently kissed each other, and whether said or unsaid
the pleasure that inflicts a peak of torment
by lips that only women know
in the mill of the death waters in varanasi,
it shakes the flame of its worth, hardens and sings
the beginning and the end of your power on earth.",0

in territories stripped from all limits, on
sands that flow from unknown seas,

if tiles are smoothed in tepid bath waters,

in their midst, inert in the lack of wind, the birch wood stands,

if the death plot is everywhere the same,

it is because we modulate in one place what has seeped from another.
even unwillingly, or perhaps it’s the shadows on the move,
we weave no more than a row of chances and discretions
along a current which takes each one of us, separately,
to the most sensitive final passage.

barracão perto da cidade gótica.
a sua casa.
conhecia-o do fandango,
e sabia apenas que uma tristeza sem lágrimas
lhe iluminava as tardes e as noites.
dessa vez foi diferente. eu acabara de partir
um copo no único pub ainda aberto

ele veio sentar-se ao meu lado, bêbedo
contra bêbedo, unidos pelo quase esplendor

não sei bem porquê, acedi. acompanhei-o
até às duas assoalhadas em que morava
– sem vizinhos, numa barraca de alumínio
e tabopan que fazia da palavra desespero
um eufemismo inoportuno. o cão,
pelo menos, gostou de nos ver chegar.
depois chorou, a troco de nada. queria apenas
um ombro concreto onde pousar a cabeça
que a mulher e as filhas já nem por engano
beijavam. não precisava de gestos ou palavras,
bastava-lhe ser ouvido, partilhar o impartilhável
a que talvez chamasse (não me lembro bem) a dor.
adormeceu assim, no meu ombro – e eu estava
capaz de matar (mas não a ele) por uma cerveja,
pelo gin que horas antes encontrara demasiado
cedo o chão. ao amanhecer, abanei-o levemente,
disse-lhe que tinha mesmo de ir. beijou-me
a mão, agradeceu com um sorriso estragado
aquele nada de nada entre dois homens
que nunca mais se voltarão a ver. cá fora,
uma luz amordaçada desaconselhava qualquer
tentação lírica, vinha morrer nas couves,
nos dejectos vários que lhe tornavam menos só a solidão.

i’d met him at the fandango
and knew only that a tearless sadness
lit up his afternoons and evenings.
this time it was different. i’d just broken
a glass in the only still open pub

he came over and sat down, one drunk
facing another, united by the quasi-splendor
of their fall. he invited me to follow him and,
without knowing why, i followed. all the way
to the two rooms in which he lived,
without neighbors – an aluminum and plywood
shack that made the word despair
an inadequate euphemism. the dog,
at least, was glad to see us arrive.
then he cried, over nothing. he merely wanted
a real shoulder where he could lean his head
which his wife and daughters would no longer even kiss
in a dream. he needed no words or gestures,
just an ear to hear him share the unshareable
which perhaps (i don’t quite remember) he called sorrow.
he fell asleep that way, on my shoulder – and i
could have killed (but not him) for a beer
or the gin that, a few hours earlier, dropped too soon
to the floor. in the morning, when i woke up, i gently
shook him and said i really had to go. he kissed
my hand, thanking me with his rotted smile

and junk that made his solitude less solitary.

It had never dawned like this, in an unimaginable
shack near the gothic city.
His home.
He was known from the fandango,
and knew only that a tearless sadness
lit his afternoons and nights.
This time was different. I had just shattered
a glass in the only pub still open
(memory fails to return the name).
He came and sat beside me, drunk
against drunk, united by the almost splendor
of the fall. He invited me to follow him and I,
not quite sure why, agreed. I followed him
to the two rooms where he lived
— without neighbors, in an aluminum and tabopan shack
that made the word despair
an untimely euphemism. The dog,
at least, liked to see us arrive.
Then he wept, for no reason. He only wanted
a concrete shoulder to lay his head
on, as his wife and daughters no longer,
even by mistake, kissed him. He needed no gestures or words,
he just wanted to be heard, to share the unshareable
which he perhaps called (I'm not quite sure) pain.
He fell asleep on my shoulder — and I was
capable of killing (but not him) for a beer,
for the gin that just hours before had found the floor
too soon. At dawn, I gently shook him,
told him I really had to go. He kissed
my hand, thanked with a ruined smile
that nothing of nothing between two men
who will never see each other again. Outside,
a gagged light discouraged any
lyrical temptation, it died in the cabbages,
in the various waste that made his solitude less lonely.
I didn't recognize the city: pallid, uninteresting, contemptible.
Shivering with sleep and cold as I entered the first

"o caminho de ohrid*
do alto das muralhas de ohrid onde
acorrera aos gritos desvairados dos vigias,
o rei samuel avistou o seu exército desfigurado,
arrastando-se entre as montanhas da macedónia.
aos catorze mil homens tinham sido
arrancados os olhos por ordem do imperador
e a um em cada cem mandara ele, basílio ii,
fosse poupado um olho para conduzirem o regresso
dessa manada cega. depois de atravessarem altas neves
vinham-se agora despenhando para o lago,
tropeçando, agarrados uns aos outros,
a tortura espelhada nas contorções das faces,
o sangue a empapar-lhes os andrajos. e o rei,
tomado pela angústia, deu um grito de dor e morreu
no alto da muralha sobre a colina e os seus bosques e pomares
que o lago placidamente reflectia.
nesse instante compreendeu como era ambígua
a força cega do destino e em nenhum mosteiro
podia a iconostase explicar-lhe esse cruel mistério:
os santos, com feições dos retratos do fayoum,
entre as chamas trémulas emudeciam
nos seus frescos e as vozes dos jovens monges,
no seu canto austero e imperturbado,
elevavam uma grave primavera na penumbra.","the road to ohrid*
from the heights of the walls of ohrid
to where he’d run upon hearing the screams
of the look-outs, king samuel beheld his disfigured
army dragging through the macedonian mountains.

gouged by order of the emperor, basil the second,
who had instructed that one eye be spared in every
hundredth man so that they could lead the return
of that blind herd. having crossed over the high snows
they now came rushing down toward the lake,
stumbling and grabbing on to one another,
the torture mirrored in their facial contortions,
blood soaking their tattered clothes, and the king,
seized by anguish, uttered a shout of grief and died
on the heights of the walls over the hill and his forests and groves
which the lake so peacefully reflected.
in that instant he understood just how ambiguous
the blind force of destiny was, and in no monastery
could the screens of icons have elucidated that cruel mystery:
the saints, whose faces resembled fayumic portraits,
remained silent in their frescos amid the flickering
flames, and the voices of the young monks,

and platão dragging the robe of light,
among Egypt's priests, hieratic and sad,
dressed in dust and dead penumbra,
in temples of moonlight and petrified clouds. . .
I see, before me, chimerical presences,
dream horizons that encircle me
in a painful embrace! dark birds
that land on my dusked forehead,
and winds that carry me through
mists and lightning. . .
and, already lost and dead, I am no more
than a human appearance,
floating on the waves of emotion
that burst forth, from within, like blood
from an open wound. . .
and I float on the waves that spread
on snowy shores and white foam,
on blue distances of endless light,
and in the vague nocturne where stars
emerge, like the devil's laughs. . .
I float in an aerial dream,
at mystical splendor heights,
where the white lily of the moon opens.
I float in an aerial dream, and see myself
an undefined being. . . the immense night,
that spreads its black wings over me,
cannot hide me. my face,
raised above the darkness,
contemplates the divine light.",0

"receita para fazer azul
se quiseres fazer azul,
pega num pedaço de céu e mete-o numa panela grande,
que possas levar ao lume do horizonte;
depois mexe o azul com um resto de vermelho
da madrugada, até que ele se desfaça;
despeja tudo num bacio bem limpo,
para que nada reste das impurezas da tarde.
por fim, peneira um resto de ouro da areia
do meio-dia, até que a cor pegue ao fundo de metal.
se quiseres, para que as cores se não desprendam
com o tempo, deita no líquido um caroço de pêssego queimado.
vê-lo-ás desfazer-se, sem deixar sinais de que alguma vez
ali o puseste; e nem o negro da cinza deixará um resto de ocre
na superfície dourada. podes, então, levantar a cor
até à altura dos olhos, e compará-la com o azul autêntico.
ambas as cores te parecerão semelhantes, sem que
possas distinguir entre uma e outra.
assim o fiz – eu, abraão ben judá ibn haim,
iluminador de loulé – e deixei a receita a quem quiser,
algum dia, imitar o céu.","recipe for making the colour blue
if you wish to make the colour blue
take a piece of sky and put it in a pot
large enough to place on the flame of the horizon.
stir into the blue a pinch of early morning red
until it dissolves. pour everything
into a brass bowl that has been well washed
to eliminate all of the afternoon’s impurities.
finally, sift in a few smidgens of gold from the sand
of midday until the colour adheres to the bottom of the bowl.
to prevent the colours from separating with time,
drop a charred peach pit into the liquid.
it will disintegrate, leaving no telltale
sign, not even – from the black ash – an ochre trace
on the golden surface. you may then raise the colour
to eye level and compare it with genuine blue.
the two colours will look so alike
that you cannot distinguish one from the other.

illuminator from the town of loulé. and i left the recipe
for whoever, one day, would imitate the sky.",pt_XX,en_XX,"recipe for making blue

so that nothing remains of the impurities of the evening.
finally, sieve a remnant of gold from the sand

if you wish, so that the colors do not fade
over time, add to the liquid a burned peach pit.

there; and not even the black of the ash will leave a trace of ochre
