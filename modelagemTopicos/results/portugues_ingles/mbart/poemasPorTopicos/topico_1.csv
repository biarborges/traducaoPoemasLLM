"amar!
eu quero amar, amar perdidamente!
amar só por amar: aqui... além...
mais este e aquele, o outro e toda a gente
amar! amar! e não amar ninguém!
recordar? esquecer? indiferente!...
prender ou desprender? é mal? é bem?
quem disser que se pode amar alguém
durante a vida inteira é porque mente!
há uma primavera em cada vida:
é preciso cantá-la assim florida,
pois se deus nos deu voz, foi pra cantar!
e se um dia hei-de ser pó, cinza e nada
que seja a minha noite uma alvorada,
que me saiba perder... pra me encontrar...","to love!
i want to love, to be lost in love!
to love just to love: here... there...
this one, that one, another one,
everyone! to love and not love anyone!
remember? forget? it’s all the same!...
hold on or let go? wrong? or right?
those who say they can love someone
their whole life long are telling a lie!
there is in every life a spring.
when it flowers, it must be sung.
the voice god gave us is for singing!
if i must come to ashes, dust,
nothing, then let my night be a dawn
and let me be lost... to find myself...","love.
I want to love, desperately love!
love for love only: here... besides...
And this guy, and this guy, and this guy, and everybody else.
Love! Love! And not love anyone!
Remember? Forget? Indifferent?
Arrest or condone? Is it wrong? Is it right?
Who can say you can love someone?
It's a lifetime of lies.
There is a spring in every life.
You need to sing it like this.
Because if God gave us a voice, we would sing.
And if one day I'm going to be dust and grapes and all,
May my night be a gloomy one.
that I know to lose... to find me...",pt_XX,en_XX,1

quem não me deu amor, não me deu nada.

o meu mundo melhor.
tanto tempo perdido . . .
com que saudade o lembro e o bendigo:
campos de flores
e silvas . . .
fonte da vida fui. medito. ordeno.
penso o futuro a haver.
e sigo deslumbrado o pensamento
que se descobre.

i look around and see
my better world unfinished.
so much time lost . . .
with what nostalgia i remember it and bless it all:
fields of flowers
and brambles . . .
i was a spring of life. i deliberate. i make order.
i think the future that will come.
and, dazzled, i follow the thought
that shows itself.

banished, i travel on.

who didn't give me love, didn't give me anything.
I'm stopping.
I look around and I see unfinished business.
My best world.
So much time wasted.
I remember and I bless.
Fields of flowers.
And silks...
I was the source of life. I measured. I ordered.
I think the future is there.
And I keep amazed by this thought.
You'll find out.
who didn't give me love, didn't give me anything.
I was devastated.
Prospero despairing.
And I dream of no home and no friends.

"amigos perdidos
os amigos levados pela vida
são os mais difíceis de aplacar, os mais
tiranos. bárbaros de um país desconhecido,
bebem à taça os venenos do silêncio e crescem
desmedidamente na distância, desentendidos
da nossa solidão. e pensar que já fomos
irmãos de armas, que desenterrámos tesouros
nas mesmas ilhas, nos livros
mais inóspitos. como são as coisas.
terá sido tudo em vão? dir-se-ia
que estávamos predestinados às mesmas
canções, a uma espécie mais certa de amor.
pois sim. nem sequer compreendemos
o que nos aconteceu.","lost friends
friends carried off by life
are the most difficult to appease, the most
tyrannical. barbarians of an unknown land,
they sip the poison of silence and they grow
beyond all limits in the distance, a blind eye
to our loneliness. and to think that we were
brothers in arms, that we dug up buried treasure
from the same islands, from the most
barren of books. how things turn out.
could all have been in vain? it seemed
that we were destined for the same
songs, for a more certain kind of love.
well, well. and we cannot even understand
what happened.","lost friends.
The friends that were brought to life
They're the hardest to replace, the most elusive.
Barbarians from an unknown country.
They drink the poisons of silence into the cup and grow.
Far and wide, they're misunderstood.
And to think that we've already been there.
Brothers in arms, we dug up treasures.
in the same islands, in the same books.

Is everything okay?
We were predisposed to the same things.

"sempre, cruel senhora, receei,
medindo vossa grã desconfiança,
que desse em desamor vossa tardança,
e que me perdesse eu, pois vos amei.
perca-se, enfim, já tudo o que esperei,
pois noutro amor já tendes esperança.
tão patente será vossa mudança,
quanto eu encobri sempre o que vos dei.
dei-vos a alma, a vida e o sentido;
de tudo o que em mim há vos fiz senhora.
prometeis e negais o mesmo amor.
agora tal estou que, de perdido,
não sei por onde vou, mas algũ’hora
vos dará tal lembrança grande dor.","cruel senhora
cruel senhora, i’ve always been wary. i knew
i needed to watch you closely in case
your doubts would surge to disaffection and erase
our love. then i’d be ruined, since i love only you.
and now, everything i’d hope to have is lost:
you’re pursuing another lover. so i detach
myself, believing your retribution will match
the sacrificial depths my love has cost:
i’ve given my soul, my senses, and my life to you;
i’ve given you everything i have within me,
and you promised love, but now, there’s only disdain.
lost and hopeless, i don’t know what to do,
yet i know the day will come when this memory
will crush you down with terrifying pain.","Always, cruel lady, I feared.
Measuring your grain of distrust.
That you despair of your own delay.
And I wish I hadn't, because I love you.
You know, after all, everything I've been hoping for.
Because in other love, you already have hope.
Your change will be so evident.
I've always covered what I've given you.
I gave you the soul, the life and the meaning.
of everything I've ever been to you, ladies.
promising and negative the same love.
And now I'm so lost.
I don't know where I'm going, but it's time.
It will make such a painful memory.",pt_XX,en_XX,1
"alma minha gentil, que te partiste
tão cedo desta vida descontente,
repousa lá no céu eternamente,
e viva eu cá na terra sempre triste.
se lá no assento etéreo, onde subiste,
memória desta vida se consente,
não te esqueças daquele amor ardente
que já nos olhos meus tão puro viste.
e se vires que pode merecer-te
algũa cousa a dor que me ficou
da mágoa, sem remédio, de perder-te,
roga a deus, que teus anos encurtou,
que tão cedo de cá me leve a ver-te,
quão cedo de meus olhos te levou.","dear gentle soul, you that departed . . .
dear gentle soul, you that departed
this life so soon and reluctantly,
rest in heaven eternally
while i remain here, broken-hearted.
if there in the ethereal skies
memories are still allowed to move,
do not forget that ardent love
you once saw shining in my eyes.
and if you judge there might be merit,
however small, in this pain that stays,
grieving with nothing to repair it,
petition god, who cut short your days,
to take me to you, in that reckless spirit
he used to summon you from my gaze.","My dear soul, have I ever loved you?
so early on in this unhappy life,
It sits there forever in the sky.
And I live here in a very sad land.
If you're in the airplane seat, where you're in the airplane seat, you're in the airplane seat.
Memory of this life is allowed.
Don't forget that burning love.
that you've already seen in my naked eyes.
And if you see it, it might be worth your while.
I can barely feel the pain that came over me.
No medicine, no shame, no loss.
Pray to God your years are short.
That so early on, I got to see you.
how early my eyes took you.",pt_XX,en_XX,1
"transforma-se o amador na cousa amada,
por virtude do muito imaginar;
não tenho, logo, mais que desejar,
pois em mim tenho a parte desejada.
se nela está minh’alma transformada,
que mais deseja o corpo de alcançar?
em si sòmente pode descansar,
pois consigo tal alma está liada.

que, como um acidente em seu sujeito,
assi co a alma minha se conforma,
está no pensamento como ideia:
o vivo e puro amor de que sou feito,
como a matéria simples busca a forma.","the lover becomes the thing he loves . . .
the lover becomes the thing he loves
by virtue of much imagining;
since what i long for is already in me,
the act of longing should be enough.
if my soul becomes the beloved,
what more can my body long for?
only in itself will it find peace,
since my body and soul are linked.
but this pure, fair demigoddess,
who with my soul is in accord
like an accident with its subject,
exists in my mind as a mere idea;
the pure and living love i’m made of
seeks, like simple matter, form.","It turns the lover into the beloved.
Because of the imagination.
I have, therefore, nothing more to wish for.
Because in me I have the desired part.
If it's in the transformed mind, it's in the transformed mind.
What does the body most yearn for?
In itself, it can rest.
Because with me, such a soul is connected.
But this beautiful, pure seed.
That's like an accident on his guy.
So my soul conforms.
It's in thinking as an idea.

How simple matter seeks form.",pt_XX,en_XX,1
"erros meus, má fortuna, amor ardente
em minha perdição se conjuraram;
os erros e a fortuna sobejaram,
que para mim bastava o amor somente.
tudo passei; mas tenho tão presente
a grande dor das cousas que passaram,
que as magoadas iras me ensinaram
a não querer já nunca ser contente.
errei todo o discurso de meus anos;
dei causa [a] que a fortuna castigasse
as minhas mal fundadas esperanças.
de amor não vi senão breves enganos.
oh! quem tanto pudesse que fartasse
este meu duro génio de vinganças!","my errors, cruel fortune and ardent love . . .
my errors, cruel fortune and ardent love
conspired to bring about my ruin;
the errors and fortune were superfluous,
since love alone would have done as much.
although it’s over, the dreadful pain
of what i suffered is still so vivid
that i, with bitter rage, have learned
never to try to be happy again.
in life and words i’ve always strayed,
giving fortune cause to punish
my poorly founded hopes.
in love i’ve known just brief illusions.
oh! if only my ruthless genius
would have its fill of wreaking vengeance!","My mistakes, bad luck, fierce love.
in my peril they came to me.
Mistakes and luck skyrocketed.
that love alone was enough for me.
Everything has happened.
The pain of things that have gone on.
I was taught by the bruised sisters.
to never want to be happy again.
I've mispronounced my entire speech over the years.
I set out to make sure that fortune punishes bad people.
My badly-founded hopes.
I didn't see love except brief deceptions.

"busque amor novas artes, novo engenho,
para matar-me, e novas esquivanças;
que não pode tirar-me as esperanças,
que mal me tirará o que eu não tenho.
olhai de que esperanças me mantenho!
vede que perigosas seguranças!
que não temo contrastes nem mudanças,
andando em bravo mar, perdido o lenho.
mas, conquanto não pode haver desgosto
onde esperança falta, lá me esconde
amor um mal, que mata e não se vê.
que dias há que n’alma me tem posto.
um não sei quê, que nasce não sei onde,
vem não sei como, e doi não sei porquê.","may love seek out new arts, devise a plot . . .
may love seek out new arts, devise a plot
to kill me, and discover new disdain;
for robbing me of hope will be in vain,
since it can scarcely take what i’ve not got.
behold the kind of hopes on which i stand!
and see how perilous my certainties!
for i fear neither change nor enmities,
ploughing the sea, lost far from any land.
and yet, although one cannot pay grief’s toll
where hope is gone, still love has hidden there
for me an ill, that kills and can’t be seen;
how long ago did love place in my soul
i don’t know what, born i don’t know where,
come i don’t know how, nor why it aches so keen.","Look for love, new skills, new ingenuity.
to kill me, and new squiggles.
It can't take hope away from me.
It's going to take away what I don't have.
I looked at what hope I had!
He sees dangerous safety.
I don't fear contrast or change.
I've lost my lens.
But how heartbreaking that can be!
Where there is no hope, there is hiding for me.
I love an evil that kills and doesn't see.
How many days ago did that nightmare strike me?

I don't know how, and I don't know why.",pt_XX,en_XX,1
"quem vê, senhora, claro e manifesto
o lindo ser de vossos olhos belos,
se não perder a vista só em vê-los,
já não paga o que deve a vosso gesto.

mas eu, por de vantagem merecê-los,
dei mais a vida e alma por querê-los,
donde já me não fica mais de resto.
assi que a vida e alma e esperança
e tudo quanto tenho, tudo é vosso,
e o proveito disso eu só o levo.

whoever, lady, sees plainly on view

without being blinded in the act of seeing

this seems to me an honest price,
but i, for the merit of deserving them,
gave both life and soul to serve them
apart from which i am without resource.
enough that life and soul and hope
and as much as i have is all yours,
and the proof of this i alone know.
for such good fortune is beyond scope

The beauty of your beautiful eyes.
If you don't lose your sight just by seeing them, you're dead.
He no longer pays for your gesture.
This seemed like an honest price to me.

I gave more life and soul for them.
where I'm no longer left.
I believe that life and soul and hope
And everything I have, everything is yours.

"amor é um fogo que arde sem se ver,
é ferida que doi, e não se sente;
é um contentamento descontente,
é dor que desatina sem doer.
é um não querer mais que bem querer;
é um andar solitário entre a gente;
é nunca contentar-se de contente;
é um cuidar que ganha em se perder.
é querer estar preso por vontade;
é servir a quem vence, o vencedor;
é ter com quem nos mata, lealdade.
mas como causar pode seu favor
nos corações humanos amizade,
se tão contrário a si é o mesmo amor?","love is a fire that burns unseen . . .
love is a fire that burns unseen,
a wound that aches yet isn’t felt,
an always discontent contentment,
a pain that rages without hurting,
a longing for nothing but to long,
a loneliness in the midst of people,
a never feeling pleased when pleased,
a passion that gains when lost in thought.
it’s being enslaved of your own free will;
it’s counting your defeat a victory;
it’s staying loyal to your killer.
but if it’s so self-contradictory,
how can love, when love chooses,
bring human hearts into sympathy?","Love is a fire that burns invisibly.
It's wound to me, and it doesn't feel.
It's a dissatisfied contentment.
It's pain that vanishes without pain.
It's one not to want more than just to want.
It's a lonely walk among people.
It's never about being happy.
It's a caretaker who earns by losing.
It's wanting to be caught wanting to be caught.
It's to serve the winner, the winner.
It's to have someone to kill you with, to be loyal to.
But how can it benefit you?
in human hearts, friendship.
if it's the opposite of that same love?",pt_XX,en_XX,1
