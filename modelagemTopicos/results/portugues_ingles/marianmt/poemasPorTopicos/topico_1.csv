"amar!
eu quero amar, amar perdidamente!
amar só por amar: aqui... além...
mais este e aquele, o outro e toda a gente
amar! amar! e não amar ninguém!
recordar? esquecer? indiferente!...
prender ou desprender? é mal? é bem?
quem disser que se pode amar alguém
durante a vida inteira é porque mente!
há uma primavera em cada vida:
é preciso cantá-la assim florida,
pois se deus nos deu voz, foi pra cantar!
e se um dia hei-de ser pó, cinza e nada
que seja a minha noite uma alvorada,
que me saiba perder... pra me encontrar...","to love!
i want to love, to be lost in love!
to love just to love: here... there...
this one, that one, another one,
everyone! to love and not love anyone!
remember? forget? it’s all the same!...
hold on or let go? wrong? or right?
those who say they can love someone
their whole life long are telling a lie!
there is in every life a spring.
when it flowers, it must be sung.
the voice god gave us is for singing!
if i must come to ashes, dust,
nothing, then let my night be a dawn
and let me be lost... to find myself...","- Love!
I want to love, love lost!
to love just for loving: here... beyond...
plus this one and that one, the other one and everyone
love! love! and love no one!
remember? forget? indifferent!...
It's wrong, it's okay, it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong, it's wrong.
who says you can love someone
It's because he's lying all his life!
There's a spring in every life:
You have to sing it like that,
For if God gave us a voice, it was to sing.
And if one day I'll be dust and ashes and nothing
May my night be a dawn,
who knows how to lose me... to find me...",pt_XX,en_XX,1

i needed to watch you closely in case
your doubts would surge to disaffection and erase
our love. then i’d be ruined, since i love only you.
and now, everything i’d hope to have is lost:
you’re pursuing another lover. so i detach
myself, believing your retribution will match
the sacrificial depths my love has cost:
i’ve given my soul, my senses, and my life to you;
i’ve given you everything i have within me,
and you promised love, but now, there’s only disdain.
lost and hopeless, i don’t know what to do,
yet i know the day will come when this memory
will crush you down with terrifying pain.","Always, cruel lady, I'm afraid,
measuring your great mistrust,
who gave in love your tardiness,
And that I should lose myself, for I loved you.

so obvious will be your change,
as I always covered up what I gave you.

a grande dor das cousas que passaram,

never to try to be happy again.

to kill me, and discover new disdain;
for robbing me of hope will be in vain,

and see how perilous my certainties!
for i fear neither change nor enmities,
ploughing the sea, lost far from any land.
and yet, although one cannot pay grief’s toll
where hope is gone, still love has hidden there
for me an ill, that kills and can’t be seen;

come i don’t know how, nor why it aches so keen.","Seek love new arts, new ingenuity,

walking in the open sea, lost the wood.

é nunca contentar-se de contente;

a passion that gains when lost in thought.
