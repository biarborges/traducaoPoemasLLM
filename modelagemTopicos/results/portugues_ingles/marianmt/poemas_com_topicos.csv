"uma canção póstuma para paul celan

como o cabelo com o tom escuro dos violinos me escurece, como
escurece o vento nos bosques frios em que morremos, escurecem as alamedas

até nos combóios que cavam um túmulo pelos ares, se te vejo, sulamith — eu «escureço — «e escureço

"a viagem de alexandre à índia
andaste de um ao outro lado da terra na vida interminável,
tiveste degredos, piedosos cíumes, a fé desvanescida,
amantes paradas na lavoura, roubando-te o rosto amado.
viste vestígios de que foste a sombra de ninguém,
olhos sem pudor, do reflexo dos ferros no tropel,
franjas do domínio pueril de alexandre, olhando gaugamela.
partiste num porto de transição para o levante,
com vazios para trás, todo o tempo a poder ver,
e ao primeiro inverno, pelos cardeais das suas cinzas,
começaste a travessia que não termina, a história que não acaba.
soubeste porque se vislumbra, em lágrimas, o pinheiro da juventude,
o nome quebrado num turvo ar medido sem corda,
e a maresia do vento de feição no segundo inverno.
em troca perseguiste o que rege o homem fortuito,
segredando em palácios de mármore que são apenas pedras,
dos fracassos a que jamais alguém ajoelhara.
ao terceiro inverno descobriste o hemisfério, e ao quarto,
sem ideia de guerra ou ordem para mudar o reino,
escolheste adornar os aquedutos sob o manto dos regatos,
sentado, na brisa no tanque, ao febril entardecer.
de quem te aproximaste, no seu trajecto interminado,
sem lugar senão o que esfria na mente recortada,
naquilo que se ramifica, tornando-se na própria teia,
contigo propagou o dever de passar em toda a parte.
e quando veio o quinto inverno, e o sexto, suturaste o sangue,
trouxeste a pele à curva dos rios, acolheste o que de resto se desmorona,
e pudeste enfim, na crença dos migradores furtivos, entender que
tudo se perde noutro lugar ainda, e após esse ainda noutro
e que ao fim de cada manhã noutra manhã
tudo é incerto, tão conforme o dente-de-leão no meio de searas,
tão emudecido como a veia exausta dos não sepultados.
na mansarda onde vagueia o dia e a noite
o vento responde, cortando o centeio e o calcário, e a vela
que brilha na luz de estrelas veladas, já desaparecidas,
pisadas, mudas, engolidas aos pés do sétimo inverno,
arpoa o coração e a ruína — os meridianos despem-se, voam
em vinte e cinco anos que há pouco se beijavam, e seja dito ou não dito
o prazer que inflige um pico de tormentos
por lábios que só as mulheres conhecem
no moinho das águas da morte em varanasi,
sacode a chama de quanto vale, dura e canta
o princípio e o fim do teu poder na terra.","alexandres`s travel to india
you wandered an interminable life across the earth,
suffered exile, piteous jealousy, futile faith,
labour-arrested lovers plundering your beloved’s face.
you saw traces of having been no one’s shadow,
impudent eyes, the reflection of iron on the rampage,
hints of alexander’s puerile dominance, contemplating gaugamela.
you set off from a transient port towards the levant,
leaving emptiness behind, seeing all of time,
and in the first winter, by the cardinals of its ashes,
you started the endless crossing, the incessant history.
you knew, because the pine tree of youth can be glimpsed through tears,
of the shattered name in a cloudy mood measured without ropes,
and of the favourable sea breeze in the second winter.
in exchange you pursued that which rules the fortuitous man,
whispering in marble palaces that are but stones,
failures to which no one had ever knelt.
by the third winter you discovered the hemisphere, and by the fourth,
non intent on war or order to change the kingdom,
you chose to adorn aqueducts with the mantle of streams,
sitting by the pool breeze, in the evening´s lingering fever.
whomever you approached, in their indefinite path,
without a place except that which fades inside a patchy mind,
in that which branches out and becomes the very web,
has spread with you the duty to pass through everywhere.
and by the fifth winter, and the sixth, you stitched up the blood,
brought the skin on to the river bends, welcomed that which falls apart,
and were at last capable, with the belief of a stealthy migrant, of understanding
that all is lost yet in another place, and after this in yet another
and that by the end of each morning in another morning
all is uncertain, just like a dandelion in a field of wheat,
as muted as the exhausted vein of the unburied.
in the attic where night and day roam
the wind replies, cutting the chalk and the rye, and the candle,
shimmering in the light of the veiled stars already gone,
trodden, voiceless, swallowed up by the seventh winter,
spears the heart and the ruin — the meridians undress, fly away
in twenty five years that were just kissing yesterday, and be it told or untold
the pleasure that brings a peak of torment, inflicted
by lips that only women know
in the turmoil of varanasi´s death waters,
tests the flame of the merit, endurance and song of
the beginning and the end of your power on earth.","The journey of alexandre to India
You have walked from one side of the earth in endless life,
You've had decays, godly cymbals, faded faith,
Lovers standing on the farm, stealing your beloved face.
You've seen evidence that you've been the shadow of no one,
eyes without modesty, of the reflection of the irons in the tropal,
fringes of the alexandre's childish domain, looking at the gaugamela.
you left in a port of transition to the uprising,
empty back, all the time you can see,
and in the first winter, by the cardinals of their ashes,
You started the crossing that doesn't end, the story that doesn't end.
You knew why the pine tree of youth shone in tears,
the name broken in a cloudy air measured without rope,
and the tide of the wind of beauty in the second winter.
In return you have persecuted what reigns the fortuitous man,
secreting in marble palaces that are only stones,
Of the failures that no one had ever kneeled to.
in the third winter you discovered the hemisphere, and in the fourth,
with no idea of war or order to change the kingdom,
You have chosen to adorn the aqueducts under the covering of the rivers,
sitting in the breeze in the tank, in the fever of the evening.
to whom you have come, in its interminable course,
without place but that which cools in the cut-off mind,
in that which is branched, becoming in the web itself,
with you spread the duty to pass everywhere.
And when the fifth winter came, and the sixth, thou didst suture the blood,
Thou hast brought the skin to the bend of the rivers, and hast received what is left to fall,
and you could finally, in the belief of the stealth migrants, understand that
everything is lost somewhere else, and after that still somewhere else

Everything is uncertain, just as the lion's tooth is in the middle of evenings,
as emuded as the exhausted vein of the unburied.

that shines in the light of stars veiled, already disappeared,
treads, mutes, swallowed at the feet of the seventh winter,
Harpoa the heart and the ruin — the meridians take off, fly
in the twenty-five years that were just kissed, and whether or not said
the pleasure that inflicts a peak of torments
by lips that only women know
in the mill of the waters of death in varanasi,
shakes the flame of what it is worth, lasts and sings

i’m thinking of you, dear girl,
your mother’s memory haunts me.
my eyes fill up with tears,
they are bathing you gently.
you were born amid sorrow—
may it yet prove a blessing.
since fortune, struck with envy,
singled you out at birth.
gone forever was contentment,
you heard no joyful voices.
your mother’s life had ended,
while ours went on in sadness.
in anguish born and raised!
i don’t know where all this is going.
i’ve watched you grow, my girl,
with green eyes so lovely.
beauty like yours wasn’t meant
to be born in exile. curses on
fate! this was clearly a work
of malevolence, not a mistake.
here lies your mother,
and we languish in grief.
you did nothing, my girl,
to incur a loss so great.
the fates spurn reason,
and will admit no protest.
i pity your poor father,
for the pain he must lament.
i heard you crying, alone,
before anyone else. you’d not
be here, had i not been there.
still, i ask if i did right.
but surely it can’t be wrong
for you to have been born
with that elegant smile of yours,
those dazzling green eyes.
it’s an unlikely comfort
that i take for myself.

"écloga segunda
dizem que havia um pastor
antre tejo e odiana,
que era perdido de amor
por uma moça joana:
joana patas guardava
pela ribeira do tejo
seu pai acerca morava
e o pastor, de alentejo
era: e jano se chamava
quando as fomes grandes foram
que alentejo foi perdido
da aldeã que chamam torrão
foi este pastor fogido:
levava um pouco de gado
que lhe ficou de outro muito
que lhe morreu de cansado
que alentejo era enxuto
d’água, e mui seco de prado
toda a terra foi perdida
no campo do tejo só
achava o gado guarida
ver alentejo era um dó:
e jano, pera salvar
o gado que lhe ficou,
foi esta terra buscar,
e um cuidado levou,
outro foi ele lá achar
o dia que ali chegou
com seu gado e com seu fato
com tudo se agasalhou
em uma bicada de um mato:
e levando-o a pascer
o outro dia à ribeira
joana acertou de ir ver,
que andava pela ribeira
do tejo: a flores colher
vestido branco trazia
um pouco afrontada andava
fermosa bem parecia
aos olhos de quem na olhava:
jano em vendo-a foi pasmado
mas por ver que ela fazia
escondeu-se antre um prado:
joana flores colhia
jano colhia cuidado
despois que ela teve as flores
já colhidas e escolhidas,
as desvariadas cores
com rosas entremetidas:
fez delas uma capela
e soltou os seus cabelos
que eram tão longos como ela
e de cada um a jano em vê-los
lhe nascia uma querela
e em quanto aquisto fazia
joana: o seu gado andava
por dentro da água fria
todo após quem o guiava:
dum pato grande era guia
e todo junto em carreira
ora rio acima ia,
ora, na mesma maneira
o rio abaixo descia
joana como assentou
a capela: foi com a mão
à cabeça, e atentou
se estava em boa feição:
não ficando satisfeita
do que da mão presumia
partiu-se dali direita
para onde o rio fazia
d’água: uma mansa, colheita
chegando à beira do rio,
as patas logo vieram
todas uma e uma, em fio,
que toda a água moveram:
de quanto ela já folgou
com aquestes gasalhados
tanto entonces lhe pesou
e com pedras e com brados
d’ali longe as enxotou
depois que elas foram idas
e que a água assossegou
joana as abas erguidas
entrar pel’água ordenou,
e assentando-se então
as çapatas descalçou
e pondo-as sobre o chão
por dentro d’água entrou
e a jano polo coração
em quanto com passos quedos
joana pela água ia
antre uns desejos e medos
jano onde estava ardia:
não sabia se falasse
se saísse, se estivesse
que o amor mandava que ousasse
e por que a não perdesse
fazia que arreceasse
dizem que naqueste meo
se esteve joana olhando
e descobrindo o seu seo
olhou-se, e dixe um ai dando:
eu guardo patas coitada
não sei onde isto há de ir ter
mais era eu pera guardada
que concerto foi este ser
fermosa, e mal empregada
em aquisto jano ouvindo
não se pôde em si sofrer
que d’antre as ervas saindo
se não lançasse a correr:
joana quando sentiu
os estrompidos de jano
e que se virou e o viu
temor do presente dano
lhe deu pés com que fugiu
mui perto estava o casal
onde vivia o pai dela
que fez ir mais longe o mal
que jano teve de vê-la:
mas o medo que causou
joana partir-se assi
tanto as mãos lhe embaraçou
que a çapata esquerda ali
com a pressa lhe ficou
jano quando viu, e olhou
que nenhum remédio havia
pera o lugar se tornou
aonde ela n’água se via:
e vendo a çapata estar
no areal, à beira d’água
foi correndo a abraçar
tomando-a cresceu-lhe a mágoa
e começou de chorar
toda a çapata e os peitos
em lagrimas se banharam
muitos foram os respeitos
que tanto choro causaram:
encostado ao seu cajado
a çapata na outra mão
despois de um longo cuidado
de dentro do coração
começou falar cansado
jano
despojo da mais fermosa
cousa, que viram meus olhos
pera eles sois uma rosa
e pera o coração abrolhos:
çapata deixada aqui
pera mal de outro mor mal
quem te leixou, leva a mi,:
que troca tão desigual
mais pois assi é seja assim
agora hei vinte e um anos
e nunca inda ‘té agora
me acorda de sentir danos
os deste meu gado em fora:
e hoje per caso estranho
não sei em que hora aqui vim
cobrei cuidado tamanho,
que aos outros todos pôs fim
eu mesmo a mim mesmo estranho
antes que este mal viesse
que me tantos vai mostrando
que alguns cuidados tivesse
não me matavam cuidando,
agora por meus pecados
e segundo em mi vou vendo
não podem ser outros fados
meus cuidados não entendo
e moiro-me assi de cuidados
dentro de meu pensamento
há tanta contrariedade
que sento contra o que sento
vontade, e contra vontade:
estou em tanto desvairo,
que não me entendo comigo
donde esperarei repairo
que vejo grande o perigo
e muito mor o contrario
quem me trouxe a esta terra
alhea, onde guardada
me estava tamanha guerra
e a esperança levada:
comigo me estou espantado
como em tão pouco me dei
mas cuidando nisto estando,
os olhos com que outrem olhei
de mim, se estavam vingando
e por meu mal ser mor: inda
de mim tenho o agravo mor
que da minha mágoa infinda
eu fui parte e causador,
que se me não alevantara
d’antre as ervas onde estava
mais dos meus olhos gozara
e já que assi se ordenava
isto ao menos me ficara
desastres cuidava eu já,
quando eu ontem aqui cheguei
que a vós e á ventura má,
ambos acabava e errei:
triste que me parecia
que o meu gado remediado
comigo bem me haveria
e estava-me ordenado
est’outro mal que inda havia
o mal, não vos sabe a vós
quem me vos a mim causou
tristes dos meus olhos sós
que trouveram aonde estou:
olhos: acerto, lugar
ribeira mor das ribeiras
que levam as águas ao mar
vós me sereis verdadeiras
testemunhas do pesar
autor
e em dizendo isto parece
trasportou-se no seu mal
e como a quem o ar falece
caiu naquele areal:
grande espaço se passou
que esteve ali sem sentido
e neste meo chegou
um pastor seu conhecido
e que dormia cuidou
franco de sandovir era
o seu nome, e buscava
uma frauta que perdera
que ele mais que a si amava:
este era aquele pastor
a quem celia muito amou
ninfa do maior primor
que em mondego se banhou
e que cantava milhor
e a frauta sua era aquela
que lhe celia dera, quando
o desterraram por ela,
chorando ele, ela chorando:
viera ele ali mora
porque achou aquelas terras
mais conformes ao cuidar
d’ambas partes cercam serras,
no meu campos para olhar
doutro tempo conhecidos
estes dous pastores eram
d’estranhas terras nascidos,
não no bem que se quiseram;
e por aquesta razão
tornou franco a lhe notar
como jazia no chão
e deu-lhe que suspeitar
o lugar e a feição
muito esteve duvidando
o que aqui franco faria
indo-se e jano deixando
o coração lhe doía:
também pera o acordar
não sabia se acertava
que jano era no lugar
novo, e arreceava
em cabo de o anojar
naquesta dúvida estando
jano estava emborcado
dixe um suspiro dando
ai cuidado, e mais cuidado:
ouvindo-lhe isto dizer
franco se ficou pasmado
e tornando-o milhor ver
de sob seu esquerdo lado
viu-lh’a çapata ter
suspeitou logo o que era,
(que era também namorado)
e no que jano dixera
se houve por certificado
naquisto jano acordou
quando viu franco estar
sem fala um pouco ficou
franco, após o saudar
falar-lhe assi começou
franco cuidava eu agora jano
que estavas em outra parte
e polo teu, aqueste ano
me pesava ir por esta arte:
dessejava ver-te aqui
quando me contava alguém
a seca grande que hai
em alentejo, e porém
não quisera eu ver-te assi
conta-me que mal foi este
que tão demudado estás
ou que houveste ou perdeste
se há remédio havê-lo-ás:
faz jano então por se erguer
não podendo de cansado
foi-lhe a mão, franco, estender
e a um freixo encostado
lhe começou responder
jano
vim a estes campos que vejo
por dar vida a este meu gado
vi acabado um desejo,
outro maior começado:
às minhas vacas dei vida
e a mim a fui tirar
a profecia é cumprida
que me pierio foi dar
vendo-me a barba pungida
autor
de pierio vai grã fama
(dixe franco) antre os pastores
todos por amigos chama
e dizem que é dado a amores,
rogo-te jano me digas
pois te ele avisou primeiro
como cobraste fadigas
que ouço que é mui verdadeiro
pera amigos e amigas
jano
tão cansado, respondeu
de um cuidado, franco, me acho
que m’agora aqui nasceu
que até na voz tenho empacho,
aos que hão de aquecer
não pode homem resistir
que o há de ser, há de ser
não se lhe pode fugir,
defender, nem esconder
mas por que franco, contigo
desabafo eu em falar
por que sei que és meu amigo
tudo te quero contar:
nem remédio nem conforto
não te hei franco de pedir
que do mal em que estou posto
não me espero de remir
senão despois que for morto
dia era de um grão vodo
que a um santo se fazia
onde ia o povo todo
por ver e por romaria,
lembra-me que andava eu então
vestido todo de novo
ao ombro um chapeirão
que pasmava todo o povo
com um cajado na mão
tomando-me pelo braço
pierio, então me levou
d’ali um grande pedaço
onde milhor sombra achou:
e mandando-me assentar
ele também se assentou
e antes de começar
pera mim um pouco olhou
e a voltas de chorar
pierio
vejo-te (me dixe) jano,
dos bens do mundo abastado
mas contando ano e ano
fico de todo cortado:
vejo-te lá pela idade
de nuve negra cercado
vejo-te sem liberdade
de tua terra desterrado
e mais de tua vontade
em terra que inda não viste,
pelo que nela hás de ver,
vejo-te o coração triste
pera em dias que viver,
hás de morrer de uma dor
de que agora andas bem fora
por isso vive em temor
que não sabe homem aquela hora
em que lhe há de vir o amor
não pode já longe vir
jano aquisto que te digo
vejo-te a barba pungir
olha como andas contigo:
à terra estranha irás
por teu gado não perderes
longos males passarás
por uns mui breves prazeres
que verás ou não verás
(e dando um pouco á cabeça,
á maneira d’anojado)
por teu bem porém te cresça
a barba (dixe) de honrado:
treslada-o no coração
isto que te aqui direi
que ainda que te aqui direi
que ainda alguns tempos virão
jano, que te alembrarei
mande deus que seja em vão
por cobrares a fazenda
a ti mesmo perderás
perda que não tem emenda
despois quando o saberás:
nos campos de uma ribeira
onde vales há a lugares
te está guardada a primeira
causa destes teus pesares
noutra parte a derradeira
jeitos em cousas pequenas
louros cabelos ondados
porão pera sempre em penas
a ti e a teus cuidados:
falas cheas de desdém
de presunção cheas delas
cousas que outras cousas têm
te causarão as querelas
de que morrer te convém
de todo o que te hei contado
todo casi aconteceu

between the rivers tagus
and guadiana, there lived,
it’s said, a shepherd lost
in love for one joana.
the maiden kept ducks
along the tagus’s banks,
her father’s house nearby.
the shepherd’s name was jano,
he hailed from alentejo.
when famine swept the land,
laying it all to waste,
the shepherd, seeking refuge,
fled torrão, his village.
he took with him the remnants
of his once-great flock,
the rest dead of exhaustion.
the drought-struck alentejo
was rather poor in pasture.
everywhere was the piteous
sight of barren fields!
only in the tagus’s
meadows could his flock
find relief. and so jano,
to save his dwindling herd,
set out for land to graze on.
the heart he held was troubled,
and trouble was waiting ahead.
the day that he arrived
with goats and sheep in tow,
he pitched camp at the edge
of a wood. the next morning,
while taking his flock to feed
along the river’s margins,
he laid eyes on joana,
out picking the flowers
that lined the tagus’s banks.
the dress she wore was white,
her cheeks were lightly flushed,
to jano, his eyes agog,
she looked fair and lovely.
though smitten at first sight,
he crouched behind the reeds,
admiring her from a distance.
joana gathered flowers,
in jano passion gathered.
after she had collected
her flowers and selected
the various shades, weaving
the blossoms together with roses,
she made a garland, and let
her hair fall: those tresses
were as long as she was tall.
every lock of her hair
was awakening jano’s desire.
as joana tidied her hair,
her flock of hens waddled
into the cool water,
guided by a huge mallard.
they swam, now upriver,
all in one direction,
now swiftly swam downstream,
together in single file.
joana placed the garland
on her head, stroking it
with her hands to see if
all sat perfectly in place.
not quite satisfied
with what her fingers revealed,
straight away she went
to where the river formed
a cove of placid water.
no sooner had she reached
the bank than her ducks came
flocking towards her, one after
the other, splashing wildly.
initially she’d delighted
in these shows of affection,
quickly her heart grew heavy.
flinging rocks and jeers,
she shooed the ducks away.
once they were all gone,
and the water calm again,
joana tucked her skirt up,
preparing for a swim.
she sat upon the bank,
carefully removing her slippers,
placing each on the ground.
then into the water she went,
and deep into jano’s heart.
as joana took delicate
steps into the river,
jano kept utterly still,
ablaze with desire and fear.
whether to speak, run,
stay put — he didn’t know.
love demanded boldness,
and yet the very thought of
losing her stirred up dread.
all this time joana
stood gazing at her reflection.
staring at her bosom,
she gave a sigh and said:
“what torment! a keeper
of ducks, i should be kept.
where is my life going?
what cruel sense of harmony:
to be fair and drudging away!
hearing these words jano
couldn’t contain himself.
having no other choice,
he burst out the grassy bank.
joana, feeling the thunderous
crash of jano’s footsteps,
turned and saw his face.
sensing the danger at hand,
she swiftly ran toward home.
the house where her father lived
was near, which plunged jano
further into the despair
born of their encounter.
the same fear that had urged
joana’s feet forward
also completely seized
her hands — and in her haste
she grabbed only one slipper.
looking around jano
saw there was no remedy,
turning his gaze to where
joana had studied her image.
when he spotted her slipper
on top the pebbly shore,
he raced over to retrieve it.
squeezing it in his arms,
he felt his sorrow grow,
and began to weep, bathing
his chest and the slipper in tears.
many were the reasons
for his anguished weeping.
leaning against his staff,
holding the slipper tightly,
jano paused for a moment
then he spoke from the heart,
exhausted and teary-eyed.
jano
“o remnant of the fairest
thing that i’ve ever seen,
to my eyes you are a rose,
and to my heart, thistles.
slipper cruelly forgotten,
remembering cruel passion,
who left you sweeps me away—
what an unfair exchange!
alas, that’s the way it must be.
“in my twenty-one years
i can’t remember feeling
even a pang of sorrow,
my flock’s troubles aside.
today, by some strange fate,
— i don’t know when exactly—,
i was racked by a yearning
that eclipsed my other cares,
becoming estranged myself.
“before this present sorrow,
which only multiplies,
although i had my cares,
the caring didn’t kill me.
but now it’s far too late,
i sense the change within,
my fate’s already sealed.
i do not grasp my anguish,
and languish of this passion.
“all i think is riddled
with glaring contradictions:
i oppose what i desire,
while desiring the opposite.
what i feel is so muddled,
i’m at odds with myself.
where might i look for relief?
i know the danger is grave—
graver is my confusion.
“who brought me to this strange
land, where an all-out war
awaited me and where i had
my hope taken away?
i scarcely can believe it:
here i am, reduced
to tears, passion’s slave.
the eyes with which i glimpsed
my beloved are taking revenge.
“my sorrow is greater still:
i brought this all on myself,
culprit and victim of infinite
suffering. had i only
stayed hidden in the reeds,
i would have feasted my eyes
on her beauty, and then —
since it has to be this way —,
at least i’d have my memory.
“disaster upon disaster!
yesterday i came here,
thinking my troubles gone.
oh how i was mistaken!
though i’d begun to hope
that, with my flock restored,
some good might come my way,
sadly, fortune willed
that i should suffer on.
“accursed love! who made me
love's prisoner knows none.
my sad, lonely eyes,
having met her gaze
on the banks of this river
that stretches unto infinity,
carrying water to sea:
you’ll be the faithful witnesses
to all my weighty sorrows.
author
having said these words,
transported by his passion,
jano fell on the sand,
like a man starved of air.
after some time had gone by,
jano still lying senseless,
a shepherd he used to know
passed by, noting the man
fast asleep on the ground.
franco of sandovir
was his name—searching
for a flute he had lost
but loved better than life,
this shepherd was adored
by none less than celia,
that finest of nymphs who bathed
in the mondego’s waters,
hers the sweetest of voices.
she gave the flute to franco
when he was leaving for exile
—imposed on him for his love—,
he weeping as she wept.
he had come here to live,
finding the landscape appropriate
for his aching heart:
rugged hills on all sides,
open fields to gaze on.
born to very little
in villages far apart,
these two shepherds had been
friends in bygone days.
for this reason franco
turned to take another
look at the man lying
on the ground, sensing
that something was amiss.
franco struggled greatly
deciding what to do—
were he to leave jano
behind, his heart would ache.
nor did he think it wise
to rouse his friend awake.
with jano being asleep
in an unfamiliar place,
he feared that he might startle.
franco wrestling with doubt,
jano turned on his back.
heaving a sigh, he said,
“all i do is suffer!”
when he heard these words,
franco turned around
in astonishment, noticing
the slipper tucked gingerly
beneath jano’s left arm.
he suspected what it was,
for he too was in love.
in jano’s bitter words
he’d all the proof he needed.
jano, now fully alert,
realizing it was franco,
stared in bewildered silence.
franco greeted him warmly
and with these words began:
franco
“why jano, i had thought
you lived in other parts.
i feared, for you and your flock,
the year might go this way.
when i caught word of the drought
now sweeping alentejo,
i hoped i’d see you here,
though certainly not in this state.
“tell me what harm’s been done
that you should be so changed?
what trouble found? thing lost?
if there’s a cure, you’ll have it.”
when jano, still quite weak,
tried to get up but stumbled,
franco held out his hand.
leaning against the trunk
of an ash tree jano said:
jano
“i came to the fields before me
to give life to my flock.
i slaked one desire only
to know greater thirst.
to my cattle i gave life,
having taken my own!
the prophecy’s been fulfilled,
as revealed by pierio,
when my first beard came in.
author
“among shepherds,” said franco,
“his reputation precedes him.
he considers all his friends;
he’s given, they say, to affairs.
now, jano, tell me this,
if he warned you in advance,
why this present hardship?
i hear he’s an honest friend
to men and women both.”
jano
“franco, i’ve grown so weary,
of the sorrow i’ve found
since coming to this place,
i can feel the strain in my voice.
whatever fortune brings,
a man can’t resist his fate,
what will be, will be—
there’s no escaping it, no point
fighting it, no hiding away.
“but with you, dear franco,
i can freely vent my pain.
knowing you to be a friend,
i wish to tell you everything.
i don’t ask that you provide
comfort or remedy, franco.
fr i can’t hope to be saved
from the trouble i’m in,
at least not till i die.
“it was a saint’s day feast:
all the people huddled
together, pilgrims come
from far and wide to see.
that day i remember dressing
in all new clothes, draped on
my shoulder was a woolen
hood coveted by the crowd.
in my hand i held my staff.
“taking me by the arm,
pierio led me some distance,
to a well-shaded grove.
telling me to take a seat
and sitting down next to me,
he paused and stared a while,
not saying a word, looking
on the verge of tears.
pierio
“jano,” he said, “i see
you don’t lack for worldly goods.
but with each passing year
my outlook grows more grim.
i see a black cloud looming.
now that you’re of age,
i see you stripped of freedom,
in exile far from home,
still farther from your will.
“in a land you’ve yet to see,
you’ll catch sight of something
that fills your heart with sorrow
for the rest of your days.
you’ll die of an affliction
that’s now just a distant threat.
live, therefore, in fear,
for no man knows the hour
when love will choose to strike.
“jano, the things i’ve said
can’t be very far away:
i see the down on your lip;
look at how you’re acting.
you’ll travel to a strange land
so as not to lose your flock,
enduring bitter hardships
for the briefest of pleasures,
so you’ll see, should you choose.”
pierio shook his head,
a stern look on his face.
“now, for your own sake,
act with manly honor,
and etch onto your heart
the words i’m about to say.
some hard days lie ahead,
jano, i must remind you.
may god prove me wrong!”
“in trying to save your flock,
you’ll become lost to yourself—
a loss that’s beyond repair
by the time it registers.
in the fields by the river,
among valleys, there lurks
your suffering’s first cause.
elsewhere you’ll meet your demise:
“her dainty mannerisms,
her wavy blonde hair
will subject your heart and mind
to never-ending punishment.
words laced with disdain,
words uttered in scorn,
a vast array of injuries —
it’ll all make you complain
so bitterly, you’d rather die.”
jano
“nearly all that i’ve said
happened as predicted.
what’s not yet come to pass,
the past has set in motion.
just a short while ago,
i caught sight of a lady
my eyes keep searching for.
my life and soul, she’s gone,
having deemed me unworthy.”
author
while jano spoke, a bloodhound
belonging to franco found
the missing flute, clutching it
with its teeth. when he saw,
bursting with joy, franco
ran to retrieve the flute.
standing on its hind legs,
the dog placed it in his hands,
proceeding to roll on its back.
franco turned to jano,
then he said these words:
“when he sees what he’s pined for,
a man forgets all else.
i cut your story short—
for that you’ll have to blame
whom i can’t, or forgive me
yourself, jano. you know

“that flute must be dear to you
as few things are,” said jano.
“indeed, nothing’s dearer,”
franco said in response.
“whoever gave you that
must have you in her debt,”
jano said to franco,
“truly you must play well ,
unless the dog got it wrong.”
“sing something, franco,
sadness loves a song!
let us see if your music
can’t soothe my bitter sorrow.”
“of course,” franco said,
“i will sing for you, jano,
as one sings for an ailing man.
although truth be told,
my song is but a wail.”
“i would like for you to hear
the song i sang last night,
after i had lost my flute,
left with only my voice.
when at last i went to bed,
i wasn’t tired of searching,
but weary of finding nothing.
now, jano, i mean it,
i couldn’t shut my eyes.”
“there, in the deep of night,
when all was utterly still,
i belted out my song,
an owl kept me company.
from his faraway perch,
—perhaps i only imagined it—
the owl would respond with sighs
as heavy as my own.
at any rate, here goes.”

wandering in exile i ask:
what to do, where to go?
after the deepest despair,
i’ve found the greatest sorrow.
the anguish! i’m a roving
stranger in remote lands,
to which i came in search
of refuge for my flock!
i, to whom cruel fortune
affords no consolation,
fear that, being ill-fated,
i will one day be made
to die by my own hand.
how to explain myself
to one not here to ask me?
how to beg forgiveness
of one who cannot hear me?
o gift of my beloved,
whose absence shrouds the night,
my flute, lost forever!
make a grave and bury me:
i perished long ago…
and upon my tombstone,
let these words be written:
in her heart lies my soul.
if on a distant day
in years to come, celia,
wherever she may be,
having heard the smallest
portion of all i suffered,
were to fall to pieces,
unable to hold back tears—
then would my soul be sated,
or whatever remains of me.
though i ask for nothing,
since i suffer so greatly,
let my eyes drift in reverie.
day after day slips by.
these lonely nights were made
for anguished spirits like ours.
“that’s the song, dear jano,
i believed it was my last;
i confess i hoped it’d mark
the end of all my suffering.
if mind and soul don’t perish
with the body, my sorrow
will remain. let us go,
it’s time the flock grazed,
torment too has its season.”","- hatches second.

sweet the alp in the angle of her jaw
when she wakes
the canvas soaked at dawn
the grass outside darkens just as the sun rising
dilutes sleep
the mules feed off the fleeting
boreal pastures
before us a way opens up
luminously
glued to keeping quiet
to moving
but a breeze already inflames
making us want for a lake, placing
a range on the horizon
a less uncrossable elevation
than the lowlands of lived life
we say goodbye to the humid moss
fingered between thighs
stir the last pleasure out of the little
campfire that crackled
at the shelter’s opening through the long cold hours
we stuff rucksacks
leather and straps tested
we fixed our hair
munch a bit of flour
shredded bits of jerky
swigs of steaming coffee
we, the soldiers of alexander
whom nights of whiskey never fell
whose boots don’t weigh a thing
nor shame the fevers
the rectangle left by the tent
will remain for a while marking the plot of grass
stones ringing what had been
a scintillating flame later gone dark
now pasture to the scent of the timid
animals that will wander in
sounding out this sullied bit of the scene
at this very moment our scent
sails through narrow ravines
mixed with the dust and the clamor of hoofs that brings us
straying close on the edge of precipices
our own echoing
will embarrass us
but within – more silence even than the gorse
on the cliff sides –
and hardened, soaked with mist, atypical

prosa, ou sobre chuva e a pólvora:
chove fora viola o vento o vidro,

for me it makes little difference: poet, poetess –
depends on the measure, and the stress –
i prefer translator, but admit
that i sometimes can’t be plied, i’m a narcissist.
2.
my earliest poetry was about rain
and weeping. today it would be
prose and rain, or gunpowder:
it's raining out, wind rapes the window,
a street is never like the brochures –
with fine eloquence i stab my note
to the world through my heart.
it bursts, withered muscle bloat –
a thousand times that life were more than art.

if the line’s strict measure doesn’t aim to show
but is a seeking instead –
or is the taste of what it finds . . .

for the camera,

mas a região mais central do nada, o pátio
furioso da potência

as palavras são figuras do imundo, coisas que
sobraram do estampido inaugural desse dia inicial inteiro
e limpo que culminou no lugar a menos deste texto
breve logaritmo sem aplicação ou saída

de afirmar o que propende para o infindo

e dá pelo nome de imprevisto, ou acidente

asymmetrical, vestiges of that origin

from the black hole they call literature

capable of accelerating particles
as a way of seeing not only the distance the light has covered
but the central region of nihility, the furious
patio of power

left over from the inaugural detonation of this first clean
whole day that climaxed in the minus-one ground of this brief logarithmic

to voice what leans into the infinite
to secretly observe the access each thing allows through the fissure of miracle
and which goes by the name of chance, or accident

where someone without realizing threw out the marvel
of a white helium balloon still full

and later remembered: you have to write a poem about the balloon

naquele ano a chuva foi excessiva e cresceram tortulhos
nos olhos dos cães. os vitelos, ao espreitar a luz pelos sexos
das mães, afogavam-se em lama, no meio dos sambos. as paredes
das casas diluíam-se em nata e os oleiros desistiram de encomendar
a sua obra a deus. enormes cuidados foram inventados
para proteger o fogo nos altares e as crianças adoptaram a nudez.
as termiteiras deixaram de existir e as formigas aladas
perderam as asas. os pés dos mais-velhos fenderam-se em chagas
e as mamas das virgens, mal eram tocadas, colavam-se aos dedos
como cinza húmida. os lábios dos sexos das mulheres paridas
inchavam carnudos de uma carne branca e os ventres pendiam
como fruta mole.
naquele ano a chuva foi excessiva
e os horizontes deixaram de existir.
choveu por muito tempo até os cães perderem todo o pêlo
e as cabeleiras se destacarem como algas podres. o rei do jau
ficou colado ao trono e ao boi sagrado cresceram-lhe os olhos,
que depois cegaram. as sementes grelaram nos celeiros
e essa semente assim era servida aos homens e daí lhes ocorreu
um tal vigor que os seus sexos cresceram desmedidos
e os homens vacilaram, tendo-os nas mãos e mudos de fascínio.
a chuva choveu tanto que as serpentes saíram dos buracos
e vieram alongar-se ao pé dos paus, mantendo com esforço
as cabeças erguidas. nas terrinas do leite vicejavam musgos
e o leite das vacas alterou-se em soro, a coalhar na urina.
naquele ano a chuva choveu tanto que até nos areais cresceram
talos e as enxurradas produziram peixe e até o ferro se lavou
sozinho e os diamantes vieram rebolar nas pedras concavadas
de moer farinha. as próprias aves morreram quase todas
e apenas se salvaram as de penas brancas, que a distância atraiu,
depois comeu.
e aquela chuva aproveitou aos fósseis e houve minerais
que se animaram e até pedras comuns a transmudar-se em carne.
naquele ano a chuva choveu tanto que a memória perdeu todo
o sentido. as gargantas entupiram-se de limos
e as testas que os velhos pousavam nas mãos fundiam-se aos dedos
e os braços às pernas e os gestos de graça fundiam os corpos
e as jovens crianças ficavam coladas ao peito das mães.
só as bocas teimavam em manter-se abertas e quando mais tarde
a chuva parou, das bocas saíram grossas aves negras
que abalaram logo daquelas paragens. e a seca voltou

to protect the altar flames and the children started to run around naked.

branches and the rushing streams spawned fish and even the iron washed itself alone and diamonds started to tumble around the stones hollowed out for milling flour. the birds themselves nearly all died and the only ones that saved themselves were those with white feathers, which the distance attracted, then ate.

that came alive and even common stones that were transmuted into
flesh.

meaningless. throats were clogged with sludge and the brows that the aged held in their hands fused with their fingers,

"os figos de d.h. lawrence
lawrence aconselhou a que se partisse um figo
em quatro pedaços, para o comer, depois de deitar fora
a casca. deste modo, pensava ele, a sociedade não veria
com maus olhos o gesto de cortar o figo, e de o
saborear lentamente, como quem lê um poema. mas
nem todos os figos se podem comer desta maneira; e,
no caso dos figos verdes, o melhor é tirar-lhes a pele a
partir de cima, sem que ela se desprenda completamente
do fruto; e só depois de comer a parte de cima, é que
chegará o momento em que só vai ficar um pouco de figo
a segurar a casca. nessa altura, pode-se arrancá-la, e acabar
de comer o que sobra, para que a refeição fique completa.
de facto, lawrence também admite esta solução (e
aceita que se coma também a casca); mas teremos
de ir mais longe do que ele, o que significa
que se deve também pensar na figueira. e se, ao comermos
o figo, a árvore nos agarra a alma com os seus ramos
ásperos, obrigando-nos a afastar as folhas para ver como
é que se pode fugir debaixo dela, o sabor que fica na boca
lembra a imagem da mulher primitiva, com o seu ventre redondo
como o dos figos de s. joão, os primeiros, que se colhem
com um gesto só, ficando inteiros na mão. então, a mão
torna-se um prolongamento da figueira, e começo a pensar
que talvez possam nascer folhas de figueira nos braços,
como se estes fossem ramos; e que essas folhas servirão para
tapar os figos que irei colher, mantendo a sua frescura.
em alternativa, poderei transformar o tronco da figueira
num corpo de mulher nua; e essas folhas irão vesti-la. mas o figo
que tenho na mão far-me-á sentir os seus seios macios, fazendo
com que, ao tirar a casca do figo, a mulher saia de dentro dele,
e eu possa chegar à mesma conclusão de lawrence sobre
as múltiplas formas de comer um figo.","d.h. lawrence’s figs
lawrence recommended that the fig be divided into
into four pieces, for eating, after discarding
the skin. in this way, he reasoned, society would not look
askance upon the act of cutting open the fig and of
savoring it slowly, as one would read a poem. but
not all figs can be eaten in such a way; and
in the case of green figs, it’s better to skin them from
the top down, without separating the skin completely
from the fruit; it’s only after eating the top part, that
the moment arrives where there is only a bit of fig left
clinging to its skin. then you can finally pluck it, and finish
eating what is left, for the meal to be complete.
indeed, lawrence also acknowledges this solution (and
also says it’s okay to eat the skin); but we must
go even further than he does, which means that we must
also consider the tree itself. and if, while we’re eating
the fig, the tree grabs our soul with its rough
branches, making it necessary to pull back its leaves to see how
it is we can escape beneath it, the taste which lingers in the mouth
recalls the image of the primitive woman, with her round womb
like the one of the early figs of saint john, the first ones, that are gathered up
whole, in one sweep of the hand. so, my hand
becomes an extension of the fig tree, and i begin to think
that perhaps fig leaves will start growing from my arms,
as though they were branches; and that these leaves will hide
the figs that i will gather, keeping them fresh.
alternatively, i could transform the trunk of the fig tree
into the body of a naked woman; and these leaves would adorn her. but the fig
that i have in my hand will make me feel her soft breasts, making
it seem like in stripping the skin from the fig the woman might appear from within,
and i would reach the same conclusion as lawrence about
the many ways to eat a fig.","The figs of d.h. lawrence
lawrence advised you to break a fig
in four pieces, to eat it, after throwing it away
the shell. this way, he thought, the society would not see
with bad eyes the gesture of cutting the fig, and of the
taste slowly, as if reading a poem.
not all figs can be eaten this way; and,
in the case of green figs, it is best to remove their skin from
from above, without her completely unravelling
of the fruit; and only after eating the top part, is it that
The moment will come when you'll only get a little bit of fig
holding the shell. At that time, you can rip it off, and you can finish it.
to eat what's left, so that the meal is complete.
in fact, lawrence also accepts this solution (and
accepts that you eat the shell as well); but we will have
to go further than he does, which means
that you should also think about fig tree. And if, when we eat
the fig tree grabs our soul with its branches
rough, forcing us to move the leaves away to see how
is that you can escape under it, the taste that stays in the mouth
reminds the image of the primitive woman, with her round belly
like that of the figs of St. John, the first, which are gathered together,
with one gesture, getting whole in the hand. So, the hand.
becomes an extension of the fig tree, and I begin to think
that perhaps fig leaves may be born in the arms,
as if these were branches; and that these leaves will serve for
Cover the figs I'm going to harvest, keeping their freshness.
as an alternative, I can transform the trunk of the fig tree
in a naked woman's body; and these leaves shall clothe her. But the fig
that I have in my hand will make me feel your soft breasts, making
with which, when the shell is removed from the fig, the woman comes out of the fig tree,
And I can come to the same conclusion from lawrence about
the multiple ways to eat a fig.",pt_XX,en_XX,-1

it unites what’s separate:
the footsteps of those condemned to darkened ice
and sighs of love vanishing in the air.

to hear the music of falling snow, something almost silent
like the touch of an angel’s wing, assuming there are angels,
or the dying breath of a bird.

falling on a deserted field. and it falls on us, cold white snow
that doesn’t burn like the flame of love.

nor our ears, nor our mouth, nor even our hearts

to see love, nothing suffices. both winter cold and searing heat
keep it from us, from our open arms

When I was a boy, I read memories of the house of the dead.
And I saw the snow falling into the Siberian steppe.
And in the broken dostoevski fender jacket.
I love the snow because it doesn't separate the day of the night
Nor does it remove heaven from the afflictions of the earth.
o which is separated:
the steps of men condemned to dark ice
and the sighs of love that are lost in the air.
it is necessary to have a very sharp ear
to hear the music of the falling snow, something almost silent
like the sprinkling of an angel's wing, if angels existed,
or a bird's manure.
You shouldn't expect snow like you expect love.
They're different things. We just open our eyes to see the snow.
fall into the desolate field, and it falls into us, the white and cold snow.
that doesn't burn like the fire of love.
To see love our eyes are not enough,
neither the ears, nor the mouth, nor even our hearts.
who beat in the darkness with the same rumor
of snow falling in the steppes
and on the roofs of the dark huts
And in the broken dostoevski fender jacket.
to see love, nothing is enough. And both the cold of winter and the hot heat
They take him away from us, from our open arms.
and our tormented hearts.
faithful to my childhood, I prefer to see the snow
who unites heaven and earth, night and day,
To be the defenseless prey of love,
love that is neither white nor pure nor cold as snow.",pt_XX,en_XX,0

alastram em lençol os seus reflexos brancos;
e a lua lembra o circo e os jogos malabares.
duas igrejas, num saudoso largo,
lançam a nódoa negra e fúnebre do clero:
nelas esfumo um ermo inquisidor severo,
assim que pela história eu me aventuro e alargo.
na parte que abateu no terremoto,
muram-me as construções rectas, iguais, crescidas;
afrontam-me, no resto, as íngremes subidas,
e os sinos dum tanger monástico e devoto.
mas, num recinto público e vulgar,
com bancos de namoro e exíguas pimenteiras,
brônzeo, monumental, de proporções guerreiras,
um épico doutrora ascende, num pilar!
e eu sonho o cólera, imagino a febre,
nesta acumulação de corpos enfezados;
sombrios e espectrais recolhem os soldados;
inflama-se um palácio em face de um casebre.
partem patrulhas de cavalaria
dos arcos dos quartéis que foram já conventos;
idade média! a pé, outras, a passos lentos,
derramam-se por toda a capital, que esfria.
triste cidade! eu temo que me avives
uma paixão defunta! aos lampiões distantes,
enlutam-me, alvejando, as tuas elegantes,
curvadas a sorrir às montras dos ourives.
e mais: as costureiras, as floristas
descem dos magasins, causam-me sobressaltos;
custa-lhes a elevar os seus pescoços altos
e muitas delas são comparsas ou coristas.
e eu, de luneta de uma lente só,
eu acho sempre assunto a quadros revoltados:
entro na brasserie; às mesas de emigrados,
ao riso e à crua luz joga-se o dominó.

ao gás
e saio. a noite pesa, esmaga. nos
passeios de lajedo arrastam-se as impuras.
ó moles hospitais! sai das embocaduras
um sopro que arripia os ombros quase nus.
cercam-me as lojas, tépidas. eu penso
ver círios laterais, ver filas de capelas,
com santos e fiéis, andores, ramos, velas,
em uma catedral de um comprimento imenso.
as burguesinhas do catolicismo
resvalam pelo chão minado pelos canos;
e lembram-me, ao chorar doente dos pianos,
as freiras que os jejuns matavam de histerismo.
num cutileiro, de avental, ao torno,
um forjador maneja um malho, rubramente;
e de uma padaria exala-se, inda quente,
um cheiro salutar e honesto a pão no forno.
e eu que medito um livro que exacerbe,
quisera que o real e a análise mo dessem;
casas de confecções e modas resplandecem;
pelas vitrines olha um ratoneiro imberbe.
longas descidas! não poder pintar
com versos magistrais, salubres e sinceros,
a esguia difusão dos vossos reverberos,
e a vossa palidez romântica e lunar!
que grande cobra, a lúbrica pessoa,
que espartilhada escolhe uns xales com debuxo!
sua excelência atrai, magnética, entre luxo,
que ao longo dos balcões de mogno se amontoa.
e aquela velha, de bandós! por vezes,
a sua traîne imita um leque antigo, aberto,
nas barras verticais, a duas tintas. perto,
escarvam, à vitória, os seus mecklemburgueses.
desdobram-se tecidos estrangeiros;
plantas ornamentais secam nos mostradores;
flocos de pós de arroz pairam sufocadores,
e em nuvens de cetins requebram-se os caixeiros.
mas tudo cansa! apagam-se nas frentes
os candelabros, como estrelas, pouco a pouco;
da solidão regouga um cauteleiro rouco;
tornam-se mausoléus as armações fulgentes.
“dó da miséria!... compaixão de mim!...”
e, nas esquinas, calvo, eterno, sem repouso,
pede-me esmola um homenzinho idoso,
meu velho professor nas aulas de latim!

horas mortas
o tecto fundo de oxigénio, de ar,
estende-se ao comprido, ao meio das trapeiras;
vêm lágrimas de luz dos astros com olheiras,
enleva-me a quimera azul de transmigrar.
por baixo, que portões! que arruamentos!
um parafuso cai nas lajes, às escuras:
colocam-se taipais, rangem as fechaduras,
e os olhos dum caleche espantam-me, sangrentos.
e eu sigo, como as linhas de uma pauta
a dupla correnteza augusta das fachadas;
pois sobem, no silêncio, infaustas e trinadas,
as notas pastoris de uma longínqua flauta.
se eu não morresse, nunca! e eternamente
buscasse e conseguisse a perfeição das cousas!
esqueço-me a prever castíssimas esposas,
que aninhem em mansões de vidro transparente!
ó nossos filhos! que de sonhos ágeis,
pousando, vos trarão a nitidez às vidas!
eu quero as vossas mães e irmãs estremecidas,
numas habitações translúcidas e frágeis.
ah! como a raça ruiva do porvir,
e as frotas dos avós, e os nómadas ardentes,
nós vamos explorar todos os continentes
e pelas vastidões aquáticas seguir!
mas se vivemos, os emparedados,
sem árvores, no vale escuro das muralhas!...
julgo avistar, na treva, as folhas das navalhas
e os gritos de socorro ouvir estrangulados.
e nestes nebulosos corredores
nauseiam-me, surgindo, os ventres das tabernas;
na volta, com saudade, e aos bordos sobre as pernas,
cantam, de braço dado, uns tristes bebedores.
eu não receio, todavia, os roubos;
afastam-se, a distância, os dúbios caminhantes;
e sujos, sem ladrar, ósseos, febris, errantes,
amareladamente, os cães parecem lobos.
e os guardas, que revistam as escadas,
caminham de lanterna e servem de chaveiros;
por cima, as imorais, nos seus roupões ligeiros,
tossem, fumando sobre a pedra das sacadas.

de prédios sepulcrais, com dimensões de montes,

i
vespers
when evening falls across our streets
and sullen melancholy fills the air,
the tagus, the tang, the shadows and bustle
bring me an absurd desire to suffer.
the sky hangs low and seems all hazy;
the gas from the streetlamps makes me queasy;
the tumult of buildings, chimneys and people
is cloaked in a dullish, londonish hue.
oh lucky travellers in hired coaches
now hieing to the railway station! countries
and exhibitions file past me: madrid,
paris, berlin, st petersburg, the world!
the timber frames of future buildings
resemble cages for keeping animals;
like swooping bats the carpenters leap
from beam to beam at the sound of the bell.
clusters of callous, tar-smeared caulkers
return from the slipways, coats on their shoulders;
i wander through alleys that lead to the river
or walk by the wharves where boats are docked.
i evoke the ocean chronicles: the moors,
old vessels and heroes – all resurrected!
shipwrecked camões swims his book to shore! (1)
great carracks that i’ll never see ride the waves!
the twilight inspires, and also disturbs me!
an english battleship launches its cutters
while swank hotels on land bedazzle
with china and flatware clinking at dinner.
two dentists argue inside a streetcar;
a clumsy clown is struggling on stilts;
children flit, like cherubs, on balconies;
hatless, bored shopkeepers wait at their doors!
the shipyards and workshops are emptying out;
the river glints thickly, the workwomen hurry;
and a black school of herculean fishwives
bursts out of nowhere, joking, laughing.
wagging sumptuous hips they come!
their manly torsos remind me of pillars;
and some, in the baskets on their heads,
rock sons who’ll one day drown in storms.
on frigates – barefoot! – they unload coal (2)
from dawn to dusk, then crowd together
in a neighbourhood where cats meow
and the rotting fish breed infection!
ii
after dark
prisoners bang on the bars of their cells –
a sound that rattles my nerves with shame!
the aljube jail, for old women and children,
rarely encloses a titled lady!
i feel so ill as the lights come on
i worry i might have an aneurysm;
the sight of the jails, crosses, cathedral,
fills and sinks my heart with tears.
one floor after another lights up,
and cafés, restaurants, tobacco and other shops
spread like a sheet their white reflections.
the moon brings jugglers, the circus, to mind.
on an ancient square two churches raise
the clergy’s black, funereal spectre;
i sketch there a lonely, dour inquisitor,
daring to extend myself into history.
in quarters which the earthquake flattened
equal, straight buildings wall me in; (3)
everywhere else i face steep streets
and the tolling of pious, monastic bells.
but gracing a common, public square
with lovers’ benches and lithe pepper trees
a war-sized monument cast in bronze
stands, on a pillar, for an epic that was! (4)
and in this assemblage of stunted bodies
i think of the fever, imagine the cholera;
returning soldiers look sombre as ghosts;
a gleaming palace stands opposite a hovel.
mounted patrolmen set out from the archways
of army barracks that once were convents;
the middle ages! others, on foot,
range through the capital, now turning cold.
sad town! i dread you’ll arouse a dead passion
in me! i mourn upon seeing your elegant
ladies so white in the lamp-lit distance,
leaning and smiling at jewellers’ windows.
coming down from the department stores,
the florists and dressmakers wrench my gut;
they’re hardly able to hold up their heads,
and many are walk-ons and chorus girls.
even in sordid human tableaus
i, with my pince-nez, find subject matter:
i enter the beerhouse; at the immigrants’ tables,
harshly lit, they laugh and play dominoes.
iii
by gaslight
and i go back out. the night’s weight crushes.
impure women roam the sidewalks.
o languid hospitals! ill-clad shoulders
shiver from drafts where streets open up.
warm shops surround me. i think i’m seeing
flanking candles, rows of chapels
with saints and the faithful, flowers, more candles,
more saints, in a vastly long cathedral.
the bourgeois women of catholicism
slip on the ground that’s tunnelled by drainpipes.
to me they recall, with their whining pianos,
the nuns who, fasting, died of madness.
an aproned knife maker, working the lathe,
redhotly wields his blacksmith’s hammer;
and bread, still warm, from the baker’s oven
sends forth its honest, wholesome smell.
and i, whose goal is a book that galls,
want it to show and examine what’s real.
boutiques shine with the latest fashions;
a street urchin gapes at their window displays.
o long descents! could i but paint
with skilled, sincere, salubrious verses
the delicate shimmering of your streetlamps
and all your romantic moonlit pallor!
that sensual, corseted creature selecting
printed shawls – she moves like a snake!
her excellence is a magnet amidst
the finery piled on mahogany counters.
and that old dame with coiled plaits!
her train with its vertical, two-tone stripes
mocks a spread fan! her mecklenburg horses
wait with the carriage, pawing the pavement.
decorative plants wilt on the tables
where clerks unroll their foreign fabrics;
in clouds of satins they bow and smile;
rice powder hovers and chokes the air.
but all grows weary! slowly, like stars,
the storefronts’ hanging lights go dim;
the glittering buildings become mausoleums;
a lone, hoarse voice hawks lottery tickets.
and there on a corner: “please, sir! take pity!”
whenever i pass him, that little old man,
bald and eternal, begs for alms:
the teacher at school who taught me latin!
iv
the dead hours
the lofty ceiling of air, of oxygen,
runs between the facing rooftops;
the stars’ tired eyes shed tears of light;
blue dreams of transmigration exalt me.
below all that, what portals! what streets!
i hear, in the dark, a screw hit the ground,
the clacking of shutters, the jangle of locks;
and the bloodshot eyes of a buggy scare me.
i follow, like lines on a music stave,
the stately double row of façades
while pastoral notes from a distant flute
trill, in the silence, a gloomy warning.
oh, if i’d never die! if forever
i’d seek and attain the perfection of things!
i lose myself envisioning wives
who chastely nest in clear-glass mansions!
dear sons! what swift dreams, alighting,
will bring sharp clarity to your lives!
i want the mothers and sisters you love
to live in luminous, fragile homes.
ah! like our grandfathers’ fleets, like fervent
nomads, like the ruddy race to come, (5)
we’ll go and explore every continent
and sail across the watery expanses!
but how, if we live enclosed by stone
in a dark and treeless valley of walls?
i think i see knives flash in the shadows
and hear a strangled cry for help.
and along these murky corridors
the taverns, if i peer in, appall me.
some sorry drunks are staggering home
and sing, arms joined, for old time’s sake.
but i’m not afraid of being robbed;
the dubious characters fall behind me.
the scrawny and mangy dogs don’t bark;
they look a little like yellowish wolves.
and those keepers of keys, the night watchmen,
scan with their lanterns each entryway;
above them loose women, in scanty robes,
smoke and cough at the balcony windows.
and looming out of that jagged mass
of tomblike buildings tall as hills,
human pain, like a baleful sea,
seeks vast horizons for its bitter tides!","The feeling of a Westerner
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Hail Marys
in our streets, at night,
there's such a scorn, there's such melancholy,
that the shadows, the bulice, the roof, the sea
They arouse an absurd desire to suffer.
the sky looks low and foggy,
the extravasated gas makes me sick, disturbs me;
And the buildings, and the chimneys, and the peat.
a monotonous and londrine colour is removed.
They hit rental cars, in the background,
Bringing to the railroad those who leave. Happy!
I happen in a magazine exhibitions, countries:
madrid, paris, berlim, s. petersburg, the world!
They look like cages, with nurseries,
buildings only emadeiradas:
as bats, when they fell from the scourges,
The master carpenters jump from beam to beam.
The squids return to the maggots,
of jacket on the shoulder, covered, dried;
I'm shivering, squeaking, squeaking, squeaking, squeaking, squeaking, squeaking, squeaking, squeaking, squeaking, squeaking, squeaking, squeaking, squeaking, squeaking, squeaking, squeaking, squeaking, squeaking, squeaking, squeaking, squeaking, squeaking, squeaking, squeaking, squeaking, squeaking, squeaking, squeaking, squeaking, squeaking, squeaking, squeaking, squeaking, squeaking, squeaking, squeaking, squeaking, squeaking, squeaking, squeaking, squeaking,
or mistake on the docks that dock boats.
and then I evoke the naval chronicles:
Moors, bass, heroes, all resurrected!
Fight trucks in the south, saving a swimming book!
I'll never see you!
and the end of the afternoon inspires me; and troubles me!
from an English bulldozer fly the stairs;
and on the ground in a tin of dishes and cutlery
Flame, at dinner some fashion hotels.
two dentists are on a plaza train;
an Arlequin tropego braces on one of the steps;
the cherubim of the home float on the balconies;
At the doors, in hair, the shopkeepers get angry!
Arsenals and workshops shall be leaked;
the river is bright and viscous, and the sheaves are hastened;
And in a black cardum, herculas, galhofeiras,
Running steady, they take out the varinas.
They've been shaking the opulent hips!
Their male trunks remind me of pilasters;
And some, to the head, pack in the baskets
the children who then sink in the storms.
barefoot, in coal discharges,
from morning to night, on board the frigates;
And they stick in a neighborhood where they're peeing chicks,
And the rotten fish generates the outbreaks of infection!
(ii)
Night closed
it touches the bars, the chains.
who mortifies and leaves a few meek follies!
the aljube, in which today they are old and children,
very rarely closes a woman from.dom.!
and I even mistrust an aneurysm
I feel so morbid, when I turn on the lights;
in view of the prisons, the old self, the crosses,
I cry my heart that fills and sinks.
the spaces, the floors are illuminated,
and the pockets, the coffees, the tents, the ponds
alaster in sheets their white reflexes;
And the moon reminds you of the circus and the juggling games.
two churches, in a broad salutary,
cast the black and funeral node of the clergy:
in them I smoke a severe inquisitor hermit,
So by the story I venture and stretch.
in the part that fell in the earthquake,
The right, equal, grown buildings are dying on me;
they confront me, in the rest, the steep climbs,
and the bells of a monastic and devout tanger.
But in a public and vulgar enclosure,
with dating benches and light peppers,
bronze, monumental, of warrior proportions,
An epic dotrora ascends into a pillar!
And I dream of cholera, I imagine fever,
in this accumulation of adorned bodies;
dark and spectral gather the soldiers;
a palace is inflamed in front of a barn.
start cavalry patrols
the arches of the barracks which have already been found;
average age, walking, others, slow paces,
they pour out all over the capital, which is cold.
sad city! I'm afraid you'll cheer me up
a dead passion, to the distant lamps,
They mourn me, they shoot me, your elegant,
Curved smiling at the windows of the goldsmiths.
and more: the seamstresses, the florists
They come down from the shops, they cause me to be assaulted;
It's hard for them to lift their high necks
and many of them are peers or choirists.
and me, one-glass goggles,
I always find subject to angry paintings:
I enter into the brewery; at the tables of emigrants,
to the laughter and the raw light you throw the dominoes.
iii
to gas
And I go out. The night weighs, crushes.
Lajedo walks drag the impure ones.
O soft hospitals! Get out of the mouths!
a breath that grabs the almost naked shoulders.
I'm surrounded by shops, I think.
see side cherries, see rows of chapels,
with saints and faithful, worshippers, branches, candles,
in a cathedral of immense length.
the bourgeoisies of Catholicism
slip through the ground mined by the pipes;
And they remind me, when I cry sick of pianos,
the nuns that the jejuns killed of hysterism.
in a spoon, with an apron, around it,
a forger handles a mesh, roughly;
And from a bakery is exalted, hot inda,
a healthy and honest smell of bread in the oven.
and I meditating on a book that exacerbates,
I wanted the real and the analysis to give me;
make-up houses and fashions shine;
Look through the windows at an imbebbe rattanier.
long descents! not being able to paint
with verses that are magisterial, wholesome and sincere,
the slender diffusion of your reverbs,
and your romantic and lunar paleness!
What a great snake, the ludicrous person,
That split chooses a few shawls with drawing!
Your excellence attracts, magnetic, between luxury,
That along the mahogany counters piles up.
And that old bando girl, sometimes,
his sleigh imitates an old, open fan,
in the vertical bars, two inks. near,
I'm sure you'll dig up your mecklemburgers to victory.
foreign fabrics are unfolded;
ornamental plants dry in counters;
rice powder flakes pair suffocators,
And in the clouds of cetins, the coffins are broken.
But everything wears out!
the candlesticks, like stars, little by little;
of the loneliness rejuvenates a hoarse caretaker;
They become mausoleums the lightning frames.
""... compassion for me!...""
And on the corners, bald, eternal, restless,
Asks me to give up an old little man,
My old teacher in Latin lessons!

hours dead
the background ceiling of oxygen, air,
it extends to the length, to the midst of the traps;
tears of light come from the stars with scouts,
Take away the blue chimera from transmigrating.
below, what gates!
a screw falls into the slabs in the dark:
They put on taipals, they put on locks,
And the eyes of a calouche amaze me, bloody.
and I follow, like the lines of a pattern
the double august current of the facades;
For they go up in silence, and are infallible and trinated,
the pastoral notes of a distant flute.
If I didn't die, never, and forever.
seek and achieve the perfection of things!
I forget to predict very chaste wives,
May they annihilate in transparent glass mansions!
O our children, that of agile dreams,
By landing, they will bring clarity to your lives!
I want your mothers and sisters shaking,
in translucent and fragile dwellings.
ah, like the red-haired race of the pig,
and the fleets of the grandparents, and the burning nomads,
We're going to explore all the continents.
And for the vast waters to follow!
But if we live, the walled ones,
No trees, in the dark valley of the walls!...
I think I can see, in the dark, the leaves of the razors.
And the cry of help to hear strangled.
and in these nebulae corridors
the bellies of the taverns came upon me, and the bellies of the taverns came upon me.
on the back, with a longing, and on the edges on the legs,
They sing, with their arms in their arms, sad drinkers.
I am not afraid, however, of thefts;
the walking dubs shall be removed from the distance;
and dirty, no barking, bone, fever, wandering,
Yellow, dogs look like wolves.
And the guards, who search the stairs,
they walk by lantern and serve as key chains;
above, the immoral ones, in their light robes,
coughing, smoking on the rock of the leaves.

of sepulchral buildings, with dimensions of mountains,

aproveitando a sombra débil e ambulante.
sentado na boleia, as rédeas na mão morena
descuidadas, um homem cisma, confia
do caminho ao macho lento a decisão.
outros homens a pé e mulheres novas
entretêm de riso a caminhada espessa.

de alguma enfermidade menos limpa

dizem que as mulheres estão na intimidade
das estrelas e a troco de uns mil-réis
lêem nas mãos destinos coloridos.
dizem que roubam quintais e assaltam capoeiras,
e os aldeões, em pânico secreto,
os expulsam com voz impiedosa e decidida mão
das cercanias do seu chão governado.
dizem que enganam os incautos campónios
em negócios sempre escuros de animais,

basta um pedaço de primavera na água, que se vai
buscar à imaginação, quando está um dia de chuva,
ou se faz entrar pela janela, quando o ar fresco
da manhã enche o quarto de azul. então,

"sobre o desconcerto do mundo (excerpt)
quem tão baixa tivesse a fantasia
que nunca em mores cousas a metesse
que em só levar seu gado à fonte fria
e mungir-lhe o leite que bebesse!
quão bem-aventurado que seria!
que, por mais que fortuna revolvesse,
nunca em si sentiria maior pena
que pesar-lhe da vida ser pequena.
veria erguer do sol a roxa face,
veria correr sempre a clara fonte,
sem imaginar a água donde nace,
nem quem a luz esconde no horizonte.
tangendo a frauta donde o gado pace,
conheceria as ervas do alto monte;
em deus creria, simples e quieto,
sem mais especular nenhum secreto.
de um certo trasilau se lê e escreve,
entre as cousas da velha antiguidade,
que perdido um grão tempo o siso teve
por causa dũa grande infirmidade;
e enquanto, de si fora, doudo esteve,
tinha por teima e cria por verdade,
que eram suas as naus que navegavam,
quantas no porto píreo ancoravam.
por um senhor mui grande se teria
(além da vida alegre que passava),
pois nas que se perdiam não perdia,
e das que vinham salvas se alegrava.
não tardou muito tempo quando, um dia,
um crito, seu irmão, que ausente estava,
à terra chega; e vendo o irmão perdido,
do fraternal amor foi comovido.
aos médicos o entrega, e com aviso
o faz estar à cura refusada.
triste, que por tornar-lhe o caro siso
lhe tira a doce vida descansada!
as ervas apolíneas, de improviso,
o tornam à saúde atrás passada.
sesudo, trasilau ao caro irmão
agradece a vontade, a obra não.
porque, despois de ver-se no perigo
dos trabalhos que o siso lhe obrigava,
e despois de não ver o estado antigo
que a vã opinião lhe apresentava,
—ó inimigo irmão, com cor d’amigo!
para que me tiraste (suspirava)
da mais quieta vida e livre em tudo
que nunca pôde ter nenhum sesudo?
por que rei, por que duque me trocara?
por que senhor de grande fortaleza?
que me dava que o mundo se acabara,
ou que a ordem mudasse a natureza?
agora é-me pesada a vida cara;
sei que cousa é trabalho e que tristeza.
torna-me a meu estado, que eu te aviso
que na doudice só consiste o siso.","on the world\'s chaos and confusion (excerpt)
happy the man who never places
his small and humble fantasy
in anything greater than simply leading
his cattle to drink from the cold spring
and drawing their milk so that he can drink!
however fortune may stir things up,
he’ll never feel any greater grief
than the weight of knowing his life is brief.
he’ll see the rising sun’s red face
and see the clear spring always flowing,
not wondering where the water comes from
nor who on the horizon hides the light.
playing the flute where his cattle graze,
he’ll know the grass that covers the hill;
in god he’ll simply and calmly believe,
not pondering truths he can’t conceive.
among the things of antiquity,
it’s written of a certain thrasyllus
that, due to a grave infirmity,
he lost his senses for a long season,
during which time, bereft of reason,
he claimed and believed that all the ships
which at the port of piraeus landed
were ships he owned if not commanded.
he took himself for a mighty lord
and enjoyed as well a happy life,
since he lost nothing when ships were lost,
and rejoiced for those that landed safely.
time went by till one day crito
his brother returned after a long absence
and, seeing how thrasyllus had lost his wits,
was moved by fraternal love to pity.
he gave him to doctors, charging them
to perform the cure thus far refused.
alas! by restoring his brother’s senses,
he robbed him of his sweet easy life!
the herbs of apollo, without delay,
gave him back his former health.
now of sound mind, thrasyllus thanked
his brother for caring, not for his act.
for when he saw himself in danger
of the toils that sanity would impose
and saw no more that state of privilege
conferred on him by his fantasy,
he sighed: “o enemy brother, pretended
friend, why did you take from me
that life so calm and free of pains,
which can’t be had by anyone sane?
“what king, or duke or mighty lord
would i have wished to trade places with?
what did i care if the world ended
or if nature’s order suddenly changed?
now dear life is a heavy burden,
for i know what toil and sadness are.
restore me to that state of bliss;
the only sane condition is madness.”","on the confusion of the world (excerpt)
who so low had the fantasy
that never put in more things
that in just taking your cattle to the cold spring
And grind his milk that he drank!
How blessed it would be!

I'd never feel more sorry for myself.
That you regret your life being small.
I'd see the purple face rise from the sun,
I'd always see you running the clear source,
without imagining the water where it is born,
Nor who the light hides on the horizon.
tantamount to fraud where or cattle peace,
I would know the herbs of the high mountain;
in God I would believe, simple and quiet,
without speculating any more secrets.
of a certain tratilau is read and written,
among the things of old age,
that lost a grain time the sisus had
because of this great infirmity;
And while, out of you, doudo was,
had for fear and created for truth,
which were their naves that sailed,
How many in the pier were anchoring.

(apart from the joyful life that passed),
For in those who were lost he did not lose,
And those who were saved rejoiced.

of the quietest life and free in everything

Why the king, why the duke had changed me?
Why, sir, of great strength?

"o caminho de ohrid*
do alto das muralhas de ohrid onde
acorrera aos gritos desvairados dos vigias,
o rei samuel avistou o seu exército desfigurado,
arrastando-se entre as montanhas da macedónia.
aos catorze mil homens tinham sido
arrancados os olhos por ordem do imperador
e a um em cada cem mandara ele, basílio ii,
fosse poupado um olho para conduzirem o regresso
dessa manada cega. depois de atravessarem altas neves
vinham-se agora despenhando para o lago,
tropeçando, agarrados uns aos outros,
a tortura espelhada nas contorções das faces,
o sangue a empapar-lhes os andrajos. e o rei,
tomado pela angústia, deu um grito de dor e morreu
no alto da muralha sobre a colina e os seus bosques e pomares
que o lago placidamente reflectia.
nesse instante compreendeu como era ambígua
a força cega do destino e em nenhum mosteiro
podia a iconostase explicar-lhe esse cruel mistério:
os santos, com feições dos retratos do fayoum,
entre as chamas trémulas emudeciam

no seu canto austero e imperturbado,
elevavam uma grave primavera na penumbra.","the road to ohrid*

to where he’d run upon hearing the screams
of the look-outs, king samuel beheld his disfigured
army dragging through the macedonian mountains.
the eyes of the fourteen thousand men had been
gouged by order of the emperor, basil the second,
who had instructed that one eye be spared in every
hundredth man so that they could lead the return
of that blind herd. having crossed over the high snows
they now came rushing down toward the lake,
stumbling and grabbing on to one another,
the torture mirrored in their facial contortions,
blood soaking their tattered clothes, and the king,
seized by anguish, uttered a shout of grief and died
on the heights of the walls over the hill and his forests and groves
which the lake so peacefully reflected.
in that instant he understood just how ambiguous
the blind force of destiny was, and in no monastery
could the screens of icons have elucidated that cruel mystery:
the saints, whose faces resembled fayumic portraits,
remained silent in their frescos amid the flickering
flames, and the voices of the young monks,
in their austere and unyielding chant,
were lifting up a grave spring in the shadows.","The way of Ohrid*

two years before dying, he again referred to the obscure
phrase written in that book, about a hope that a word
would come (to a thinking being? from a thinking being?)
in the heart. in the heart, that place where
the word is able to reconcile since it’s there beforehand,

da traição e da morte, ou tem de renunciar perante os rasgos
mais sublimes. a paixão dilacera bruscamente as personagens

também têm protagonistas, ajustes de contas, cruéis fulgores,
perseguições, e nos casos desvairados de amor não há saída.
desse falhanço insuportável nasce o melodrama,
lírico, incontido, entre golfadas de espiral vertiginosa

em que alguém vai morrer, alguém se perde alucinado,
e alguém se salva e porventura alguém escreve

we often live according to a rash
notion of stark contrasts between good
and evil, greatness and wretchedness, the swift deeds

melodrama being part of our deepest nature,
obscurely but stubbornly nostalgic for the radical heart,
which races at top speed in contradictory dreams,
which engenders seductive images and thinks it lives in freedom,
but it’s merely reckless and explosive, it stumbles
into the world’s snares, into unexpected
treachery and death, or it must renounce in the face of the most
sublime flashes. passion rudely lacerates people
attached to happiness. the obstacles we meet
also have protagonists, scores to settle, cruel splendors,
feverish pursuits. and in desperate cases of love there’s no way out.
from that unbearable failure is born lyrical, unbridled
melodrama, amid whirling, dizzying spurts
of blood and memory, of dashed hopes and tragic music,
in which someone dies, someone goes mad,
and someone is saved, and maybe someone writes down
the story, and someone else adds music
for the emotions to be more oppressive and perhaps more consuming
and facile, and someone desires this, it makes someone feel a shiver
of tingling banality, a voracious and unconfessed thrill.","for sentimental education

o futuro não o guardamos em casa, perde-se
disperso entre a meia-noite e a folhagem. nu,
exposto como uma província além da trincheira
das janelas, fala-nos do ouro puído destes dias,
desse sentido ganho nas coisas que se perdem,
salivando a passagem das horas, sustendo
contra a dor o dreno das nossas vidas.
lembramos os pequenos oráculos da infância,
os sonhos que são memórias já na sua escura
torre do tombo, ao intimarmos, no sossego
povoado, a evasiva alma do passado. buscamos
no ontem uma recompensa, sabendo que não
há outro homem para o homem deste lugar,
sangue mais limpo correndo pela carne
de quem nasce, a sua genuína morte pastoral.
eis chegado o tempo da ceifa, dos presságios
de longe trazidos no rumor das trompas outonais.
as palavras, os trémulos ramos das palavras,
pressentem o espírito da revelação em cada coisa.
assim choramos a festa última dos instantes,
dias de uma neblina fiel cobrem-nos os passos,
obscurecendo essas mãos que gostariam de subir
ao céu como escadas. se conhecesse a linguagem
fácil do tributo cantaria a queda adivinhada
a tempo de o poema terminar na forma de uma elegia.","elegy
our homes don’t lodge the future. it gets lost
among the trees and midnight. naked
like a sprawling province past the trench
of windows, it speaks of today’s tarnished
gold and of the meaning won in things lost,
which, chewing on time’s passage, hold up
against grief the conduit of our lives.
we remember childhood’s tiny oracles,
the dreams filed away in memory’s dark
archives, when in the buzzing silence
we plumb the past’s evasive soul. we seek
in yesterday a compensation, knowing
there’s no other man for the man of this place,
no cleaner blood flowing in the flesh
of the just born, his true pastoral death.
it’s time for the harvest, for the far-off
portents heralded by autumn’s trumpets.
words, the trembling branches of words,
sense the spirit of revelation in each thing.
we weep the final feast of these moments,
days of a faithful fog cover our steps,
veiling these hands that long to climb
to heaven like stairs. if i knew the simple
language of tribute, i’d sing the foreseeable fall
in time for the poem to end as an elegy.","Elegia

salivating the passage of hours, sustaining
against pain the drain of our lives.

There is another man for the man of this place,

Behold, the time of the harvest, of the omens, is come.
by far brought in in the rumor of the fall horns.

soluça ao longe a tua voz, na minha boca,
a medalha que trago ao peito, não a esquece
a neve, o frio que vai na alma, sob um céu
que escorre a sua luz de cera derretida.
corpo erguido para a cruz, sem olhos
para a lágrima derradeira, passeiam as mãos
pela branca pedra do teu rosto e quedam-se
ante os teus lábios, o silêncio.
o fumo, as sirenes do adeus escavam túneis
na paisagem. olho a lanterna imóvel sobre o neva,
a névoa eterna sobre o rio, e canto um cêntimo
de vida sob o álamo, junto aos muros da prisão.

do teu rosto, filho meu em voo pelas janelas,
perde-se como um ícone na moldura

sustendo nas minhas o calor das tuas mãos:
a loucura escreve num verso o vão delírio
de sonhar-te, tu, sombra, murmurada pela tarde
quando passa o vento em tsarskoie selo.
naufraga nas minhas pálpebras o mundo,
uma lágrima. a essa carne raiada na morgue
pela luz leio a fiada de contas do poema.
a memória é a casa que me deixaste, na sibéria.","rosary
my lips tell the lament of your distant voice,
a medal i wear on my chest, not forgotten
by the snow that wafts in my soul under a sky
dripping its light of melted wax.
body raised on the cross, without eyes
for the last tear, hands travel over
the white stone of your face and linger
before your lips, the silence.
smoke and whistles of farewell dig tunnels
in the landscape. i look at the lamplight hanging
over the neva, the river’s eternal fog, and i sing
a penny of life under the alamo, by the prison walls.
summer doesn’t enter the book of memories
of your face, my son who flies through windows;
your life is lost like an icon
in its frame. it’s not i who still awaits you,
conserving the warmth of your hands in mine;
madness inscribes in verse the delirium
of dreaming you, a shadow breathed by the afternoon
when the wind blows in tsarskoie selo.
in my eyelids sinks the world,
a tear. to the flesh streaked by light
in the morgue i recite the beads of my poem.
memory is the house you left me, in siberia.","Rosary

by the white stone of your face and fall

that something lingers forever in the days

i’ll say loudly or softly however i’m able
with wide-open mouth or already choking

"o último poeta romano
enquanto rebentam as ondas junto às praias,
e há troar de canhões além dos muros da cidade,
queria o direito a uma hora indulgente e fugaz,
num espaço inviolável,
guardado pelas asas da musa e os provérbios da sibila
como o actor recolhido aos bastidores do teatro.
esquecidos os sonhos da cabeça adornada por folhas de louro
ou os canapés onde se alongam as últimas almas epicuristas,
num sossego adverbial, em que nada mais ouvisse,
tudo ele pudesse guardar, no âmbito da sua arte,
com a leveza que deixa a pluma ao roçar o papel.
purificada, ao salivá-la como hóstia sob a língua,
cada palavra tivesse a autoridade da grinalda
ou do selo real
e estreitasse numa sebe o mundo que conheceu,
enquanto tudo se gentiliza e desmorona à sua volta.
nesse trabalho de falcoaria sobre o tempo ido,
escrever lembra-lhe os cortes feitos pela navalha
do prisioneiro na parede da cela, contando os dias,
certo de esperá-lo o nó corrediço da forca
ou o tiro disparado de frente sobre o crânio.
sabendo todo o seu trabalho entregue nessa hora
à dispersão,
deseja salvar, consoladora e suficiente,
palavra sua na face de uma estela futura.","the last roman poet
as waves break over the beaches
and cannons boom beyond the city walls,
he asks for one fleeting, indulgent hour
in an inviolable place,
shielded by the muse’s wings and the sibyl’s words
like an actor gone backstage.
forgetting the dream of a laurel-crowned head
and the couches that cradle the last epicurean souls,
he longs only for adverbial quiet – not a sound –
in which all might be preserved, in the ambit of his art,
with the lightness of a quill passing over paper.
that each word, purified, rolling on the tongue
like a host, might have the authority of a garland
or royal seal
and press the world he knew into a hedge
as everything degenerates and collapses around him.
in this work of falconry applied to time past,
writing reminds him of the notches the prisoner
cuts in the wall of his cell to count the days,
knowing what will come: the slipknot of the gallows
or a shot fired straight into his brain.
aware that all his work will now suffer
dispersion,
he wants to save, consoling and sufficient,

As the waves burst by the beaches,
And there is a thunderstorm of cannons beyond the walls of the city,

as the actor gathered behind the scenes of the theater.
forgotten the dreams of the head adorned by blonde leaves
or the canapés where the last epicuristic souls lie,

all he could keep, within the framework of his art,

e seguras o colar num gesto extravagante,
defendida de mais uma piada suburbana.
“espera-te o museu”, ia dizer, numa derrisão fatal.
a palavra é recolher sem perda de tempo
e tudo receber com uma última aclamação.

antigos, ébrios de sangue, chamando-nos
à cerimónia sacrificial. o rosto que nos promete
o televisor, vê, tem algo de ancestral e terrífico
quando o vemos a meio da fatídica arenga.
mutismo. em casa não temos almofada de joelhos
e a segurança, já o sabemos, é o teu sonho preferido,

de olhar velado e face muda, inexpressiva,
recolhida, como estás, dentro de ti,
ao esconderijo mais abstruso de todos.

desertando os dois, por um fuso horário,

tomar um revulsivo ou deixarmo-nos ir,
movidos pelo vento, sob a aba dos telhados?
nada poderás levar, num último arrebatamento.
tu mesma serás presa, na tarde momentosa,
de quando foi desejo teu e perdes sem apelo
sob a lei da plebe ou uma qualquer ordem
pretoriana, sentenciada ao motivo bíblico
e à resignação de uma existência romana.
hoje tens só a imitação do teu rosto

like a shield against one more suburban joke.
“rehearsing for the museum?” i thought to shoot.

and to salute everything with a last hurrah.
drums are rolling, dear, as in olden times, drunk
with blood, calling us to the sacrificial rite.
there’s something ancestral and terrifying
about the face the television promises, look,
in the middle of its ominous harangue.
no comment. we don’t have kneeling pads
at home, and if you lean out to the umbrellas along
the shore, we know security is your preferred dream.
you go to the balcony as an eyewitness of the fires
inevitably blazing in the distance.

with veiled gaze and a speechless,
expressionless face, withdrawn into you,
the most recondite hiding place of all.

in the distance, we look at each other,
for the promise is fulfilled, the ritual
sacrament conferred on us by time.
what should we do, you ask. hoist the sails
or dig a mine shaft in the floor, deserting
who we are as we descend time’s tunnel
to reach the world’s antipodes?
swallow a pill or let ourselves go,
pushed by the wind, beneath the eaves?
you cannot, in a final rapture, take anything.
you’ll be the prey, on that crucial day,
of all you desired and lose, without appeal,
under mob rule or some praetorian
order, sentenced to biblical logic
and the resignation of roman existence.

is what i lost. i’m a grown-up now.

despeja tudo num bacio bem limpo,
para que nada reste das impurezas da tarde.

if you wish to make the colour blue
take a piece of sky and put it in a pot

stir into the blue a pinch of early morning red
until it dissolves. pour everything
into a brass bowl that has been well washed
to eliminate all of the afternoon’s impurities.
finally, sift in a few smidgens of gold from the sand
of midday until the colour adheres to the bottom of the bowl.
to prevent the colours from separating with time,
drop a charred peach pit into the liquid.
it will disintegrate, leaving no telltale
sign, not even – from the black ash – an ochre trace
on the golden surface. you may then raise the colour
to eye level and compare it with genuine blue.
the two colours will look so alike
that you cannot distinguish one from the other.

so that nothing remains of the impurities of the afternoon.
