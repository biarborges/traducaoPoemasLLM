"a viagem de alexandre à índia
andaste de um ao outro lado da terra na vida interminável,
tiveste degredos, piedosos cíumes, a fé desvanescida,
amantes paradas na lavoura, roubando-te o rosto amado.
viste vestígios de que foste a sombra de ninguém,
olhos sem pudor, do reflexo dos ferros no tropel,
franjas do domínio pueril de alexandre, olhando gaugamela.
partiste num porto de transição para o levante,
com vazios para trás, todo o tempo a poder ver,
e ao primeiro inverno, pelos cardeais das suas cinzas,
começaste a travessia que não termina, a história que não acaba.
soubeste porque se vislumbra, em lágrimas, o pinheiro da juventude,
o nome quebrado num turvo ar medido sem corda,
e a maresia do vento de feição no segundo inverno.
em troca perseguiste o que rege o homem fortuito,
segredando em palácios de mármore que são apenas pedras,
dos fracassos a que jamais alguém ajoelhara.
ao terceiro inverno descobriste o hemisfério, e ao quarto,
sem ideia de guerra ou ordem para mudar o reino,
escolheste adornar os aquedutos sob o manto dos regatos,
sentado, na brisa no tanque, ao febril entardecer.
de quem te aproximaste, no seu trajecto interminado,
sem lugar senão o que esfria na mente recortada,
naquilo que se ramifica, tornando-se na própria teia,
contigo propagou o dever de passar em toda a parte.
e quando veio o quinto inverno, e o sexto, suturaste o sangue,
trouxeste a pele à curva dos rios, acolheste o que de resto se desmorona,
e pudeste enfim, na crença dos migradores furtivos, entender que
tudo se perde noutro lugar ainda, e após esse ainda noutro
e que ao fim de cada manhã noutra manhã
tudo é incerto, tão conforme o dente-de-leão no meio de searas,
tão emudecido como a veia exausta dos não sepultados.
na mansarda onde vagueia o dia e a noite
o vento responde, cortando o centeio e o calcário, e a vela
que brilha na luz de estrelas veladas, já desaparecidas,
pisadas, mudas, engolidas aos pés do sétimo inverno,
arpoa o coração e a ruína — os meridianos despem-se, voam
em vinte e cinco anos que há pouco se beijavam, e seja dito ou não dito
o prazer que inflige um pico de tormentos
por lábios que só as mulheres conhecem
no moinho das águas da morte em varanasi,
sacode a chama de quanto vale, dura e canta
o princípio e o fim do teu poder na terra.","alexandres`s travel to india
you wandered an interminable life across the earth,
suffered exile, piteous jealousy, futile faith,
labour-arrested lovers plundering your beloved’s face.
you saw traces of having been no one’s shadow,
impudent eyes, the reflection of iron on the rampage,
hints of alexander’s puerile dominance, contemplating gaugamela.
you set off from a transient port towards the levant,
leaving emptiness behind, seeing all of time,
and in the first winter, by the cardinals of its ashes,
you started the endless crossing, the incessant history.
you knew, because the pine tree of youth can be glimpsed through tears,
of the shattered name in a cloudy mood measured without ropes,
and of the favourable sea breeze in the second winter.
in exchange you pursued that which rules the fortuitous man,
whispering in marble palaces that are but stones,
failures to which no one had ever knelt.
by the third winter you discovered the hemisphere, and by the fourth,
non intent on war or order to change the kingdom,
you chose to adorn aqueducts with the mantle of streams,
sitting by the pool breeze, in the evening´s lingering fever.
whomever you approached, in their indefinite path,
without a place except that which fades inside a patchy mind,
in that which branches out and becomes the very web,
has spread with you the duty to pass through everywhere.
and by the fifth winter, and the sixth, you stitched up the blood,
brought the skin on to the river bends, welcomed that which falls apart,
and were at last capable, with the belief of a stealthy migrant, of understanding
that all is lost yet in another place, and after this in yet another
and that by the end of each morning in another morning
all is uncertain, just like a dandelion in a field of wheat,
as muted as the exhausted vein of the unburied.
in the attic where night and day roam
the wind replies, cutting the chalk and the rye, and the candle,
shimmering in the light of the veiled stars already gone,
trodden, voiceless, swallowed up by the seventh winter,
spears the heart and the ruin — the meridians undress, fly away
in twenty five years that were just kissing yesterday, and be it told or untold
the pleasure that brings a peak of torment, inflicted
by lips that only women know
in the turmoil of varanasi´s death waters,
tests the flame of the merit, endurance and song of
the beginning and the end of your power on earth.",pt_XX,en_XX,"Alexander's Journey to India

You walked from one end to the other of the earth in endless life,
Exiled, pious jealousies, fading faith,
lovers paused in the fields, stealing your beloved face.
You saw traces of being the shadow of no one,
eyes shameless, the reflection of irons in the tumult,
fringes of Alexander's childish rule, gazing at Gaugamela.
You departed from a transitional port to the uprising,
leaving voids behind, always able to see,
and at the first winter, through the cardinals of its ashes,
you began the crossing that never ends, the story that never ends.
You learned why the pine of youth glimpses in tears,
the name broken in a murky air measured without rope,
and the sea breeze of the wind in the second winter.
In return, you pursued what governs the fortuitous man,
whispering in marble palaces that are just stones,
of failures to which no one had ever knelt.
By the third winter, you discovered the hemisphere, and by the fourth,
without idea of war or order to change the kingdom,
you chose to adorn the aqueducts under the mantle of streams,
sitting, in the breeze by the tank, at the feverish dusk.
To whom you approached, in his never-ending journey,
with no place but what cools in the cut mind,
in what branches out, becoming the very web,
with you spread the duty to pass everywhere.
And when the fifth winter came, and the sixth, you sutured the blood,
brought the skin to the curve of the rivers, embraced what else crumbles,
and finally could, in the belief of furtive migrants, understand that
everything is lost in another place still, and after that another
and at the end of each morning another morning
everything is uncertain, as the dandelion in the midst of wheat fields,
as muted as the exhausted vein of the unburied.
in the garret where day and night wander
the wind answers, cutting the rye and the limestone, and the candle
that shines in the light of veiled stars, already vanished,
trampled, silent, swallowed at the feet of the seventh winter,
harpoons the heart and the ruin — the meridians undress, fly
in twenty-five years that had just kissed, and be it said or unsaid
the pleasure that inflicts a peak of torments
by lips that only women know
in the mill of the waters of death in Varanasi,
shakes the flame of how much is worth, endures and sings
the beginning and the end of your power on earth.",0
"da menina e moça
pensando-vos estou filha
vossa mãe me está lembrando
enchem-se-me os olhos d’água
nela vos estou lavando:
nascestes filha antre mágoa
para bem filha vos seja
que no vosso nascimento
vos ouve a fortuna inveja:
morto era o contentamento
nenhuma alegria ouvistes,
vossa mãe era finada,
nos outras éamos tristes:
nada em dor em dor crescida
não sei onde isto há de ir ter
vejo-vos filha fermosa
cos olhos verdes crescer:
não era esta graça vossa
para nascer em desterro
mal haja a desaventura
que pôs mais nisto que o erro:
tinha aqui sua sepultura
vossa mãe e mágoa a nós
não éreis vos filha não
para morrerem por vós:
não houve em fados razão
nem se consente rogar
de vosso pai hei mor dó
que de si s’á de queixar:
eu vos ouvi a vós só
primeiro que outrem ninguém
não fôreis vós seu não fora
não sei se fiz mal se bem:
mas não pode ser senhora
para mal nenhum nascerdes
com este riso gracioso
que tendes sobr’olhos verdes:
conforto mais duvidoso
me é este que tomo assi
deus voos dê milhor ventura
da que tevestes té ‘qui:
que a dita e a fermosura
dizem patranhas antigas
que pelejaram um dia
sendo dantes muito amigas:
muitos hão que é fantasia
eu que vi tempos e anos
nenhuma cousa duvido
como ela é caso de danos:
mas nenhum mal nom é crido
o bem só é esperado

i’m thinking of you, dear girl,
your mother’s memory haunts me.
my eyes fill up with tears,
they are bathing you gently.
you were born amid sorrow—
may it yet prove a blessing.
since fortune, struck with envy,
singled you out at birth.
gone forever was contentment,
you heard no joyful voices.
your mother’s life had ended,
while ours went on in sadness.
in anguish born and raised!
i don’t know where all this is going.
i’ve watched you grow, my girl,
with green eyes so lovely.
beauty like yours wasn’t meant
to be born in exile. curses on
fate! this was clearly a work
of malevolence, not a mistake.
here lies your mother,
and we languish in grief.
you did nothing, my girl,
to incur a loss so great.
the fates spurn reason,
and will admit no protest.
i pity your poor father,
for the pain he must lament.
i heard you crying, alone,
before anyone else. you’d not
be here, had i not been there.
still, i ask if i did right.
but surely it can’t be wrong
for you to have been born
with that elegant smile of yours,
those dazzling green eyes.
it’s an unlikely comfort
that i take for myself.
may god grant you the grace
that has eluded you till now.
beauty and good fortune,
or so the old story goes,
were once the best of friends,
but became bitterly opposed.
many hold that it’s fantasy,
but in my life i’ve seen
enough not to doubt it:
fate inflicts great damage.
no harm is ever believed;
we always expect the good.
in hoping and believing
lies an element of change,
an element of concern.",pt_XX,en_XX,"Of the girl and young lady
thinking of you, daughter
your mother is reminding me
my eyes fill with tears
I am washing you in her:
you were born a daughter amidst sorrow
may it be for your good as a daughter
that at your birth
fortune envied you:
happiness was dead
you heard no joy,
your mother was gone,
we were all sad:
nothing in pain, growing in pain
I don't know where this will end up
I see you, beautiful daughter,
growing with green eyes:
this grace was not meant for you
to be born in exile
cursed be the misfortune
that put more in this than the mistake:
your mother had her grave here
and sorrow to us
you were not her daughter, no,
for them to die for you:
there was no reason in fate
nor is it allowed to plead
for your father I have more sorrow
for him to complain about himself:
I heard you only
before anyone else, no one else
you were not his, it was not
I do not know if I did wrong or right:
but it cannot be, lady,
for you to be born into any ill
with this graceful smile
you have beneath green eyes:
this comfort is more uncertain
that I take in this way
may God give you a better fortune
than what you have had so far:
for happiness and beauty
say old lies
that once fought, being very friendly before:
many say it is fantasy
I, who have seen times and years
doubt nothing
how it is a matter of harm:
but no evil is believed
only good is awaited
and in belief and hope
there is change in both
there is care in both.",0

tremble at every blow,
and i feel my eyelids tremble
whenever the whip snaps.

drawn and pale they moan,
moan with every crack
that knocks them down.

with every stroke they fall,
rise back up, then fall,
still struggle up, in fear,

[sobre a fotografia de uma criança encontrada morta numa praia da turquia]

um brinquedo – só um – de que gostasse muito; e
que separasse outro brinquedo para o aylan, que
ainda não sabia escolher, mas só um, e tinha de
ser pequeno. o meu pai explicou-me que nessa
noite ia fazer de tudo quase nada numa trouxa
leve; porque assim, quando o aylan e eu caíssemos
de sono, ele e a minha mãe poderiam levar-nos ao
colo sem ficarem para trás. havia lágrimas nos olhos
do meu pai quando contou que, na manhã seguinte,
teríamos de deixar a nossa terra; mas logo se
recompôs, dizendo que kobanî também já não era
bem a nossa terra, que a nossa casa era a ruína da
nossa casa, que toda a síria não passava de um tímpano
exausto de tanto estrondo e dois olhos cansados,
mas tão cansados, de chamas e de sangue. o meu pai
achava que o aylan era demasiado pequeno para
compreender e, por isso, dissera-lhe apenas que
iríamos dar um passeio de barco, que passaríamos
o dia numa praia e que, enquanto eu e a minha mãe
nadássemos no mar até ficarmos sem fôlego, ele

na hora em que eu mais ruía
o sol aplainava o relvado, palmeiras
ondulavam num lago turvo
longe o escaravelho porvindoiro
que as reduziu a um coto
assemelhando-as a um ananás que degrada hoje
pelos jardins
o repuxo animava sem triunfo o pântano
da juventude
as varandas em fogo
o verão começando pelo fim
horas extraordinárias aquelas
em que as aves adiavam o repouso por causa
dos insectos do turno sequente
ourados absortos estrepitantes
a hora em que mais ninguém deitava como eu
a bicicleta sobre a falta
e se sentava na relva prendendo as lágrimas
as mãos tapando o rosto o rosto entre os geolhos e uma
roda atrás a girar
não havia o ecrã de bolso oportuno
era inevitável encarar o que não tem conserto
nem nunca terá
era do dia o instante altíloquo
uma harmónica crepitava nos auscultadores
feria de morte o touro da tarde
esse búfalo ermo que se aparta da manada
para ficar-se
os subidos candeeiros acendiam
havia um muro recém pintado
sujo já por um grafito de província
um cão passava ao largo levantava o focinho ao
perfume dos jantares
que chegava de onde
se entrevia o espalha-cor dos televisores
havia o farrapo de lua
como flanela posta sobre a ganga das alturas
agraudava os dós arrumados
na caixa do futuro
a hédera das extensões percorria aquela hora
uma ideia sulcava a charneca celeste
o coração alpinista no avesso dos volumes
rarefeito
o mundo era já uma seara de nojo
e fartura – belo desastroso feroz – lugar de forças
e destruições
eu tacteava de olhos fechados
puro intrínseco
procurava um celeiro urbano onde guardar
o ouro-sémen pronto a detonar
a libélula extrema o grilo inicial
a andorinha cujo ninho resulta de um cúmulo
de lama e ervas secas e rasoira
as superfícies alimentando-se no ar
nas minhas costas o exíguo refrigério
da biblioteca pública
àquela hora antro de nebulosos soldados
repousando da luta de guerrilha
hasta la derrota, siempre!
infligiam estragos mínimos a um inimigo
bronco mas relutante
apenas tombavam nas emboscadas aqueles
como eu mais sorumbáticos

that moment when i was really falling apart
and the sun lingered over the lawn, and the palms
billowed above the turbid lake
faraway the promised beetle
reduced those palms to a stump
until they seemed like a pineapple which these days
rots in the gardens
the fountain blandly animated the swamp
of the young
the balconies on fire
the summer beginning at its end
overtime hours those
in which the birds delayed their naps because
of the next shift of insects
hallucinating self-absorbed clamorous
at that hour no one else like me setting their bicycle
down on the dearth
sitting on the grass holding back tears
covering their face with their hands, face between their knees and a
wheel behind still spinning
there was no convenient pocket screen
facing up to that which can’t be fixed and never will be
was inevitable
it was on that day the eloquent moment
a harmonica crackled in my headphones
mortally wounding the afternoon’s bull
that solitary buffalo that steers clear of the herd
to die
the high lamps lit up
a newly painted wall
already marked with a small town’s graffito
a dog went past lifting its snout to the
scent of dinners
which came from where
the televisions’ color-blend rose in the air
there was the shred of moon
like flannel sewn onto the denim of the heights
it nurtured hoarded hurt
in the box of the future
the ivy of extensions twined through that hour
an idea furrowed the celestial fen
the mountaineer heart inside the volumes
rarefied
the world was already a glebe of lamentation
and overabundance – beautiful disastrous fierce – locus of forces
and ruin
i fingered with my eyes closed
pure intrinsic
searched out an urban granary where i could keep
the semen-gold ready to detonate
the extreme dragonfly the first cricket
the swallow who got up its nest in a cumulus
of mud and dried weeds who smooths
the surfaces feeding itself in the air
at my back the exiguous cooling
of the public library
at that hour a cavern of nebulous soldiers
resting from their war of resistance
hasta la derrota, siempre!
they inflicted little damage on a rough
but reluctant enemy
only those as sullen as i
walked into ambushes
so many figure eights still visible on the ground
forcefully hoed up from repeatedly going round in the same place
i had dared to go past the gate of the infinite
always ending up bent over dinner",pt_XX,en_XX,"[Neil Young]
At the hour when I most crumbled down
the sun smoothed the lawn, palms
waved in a murky lake
far off the future beetle
that reduced them to a stump
resembling a pineapple degrading today
through the gardens
the fountain animated without triumph the marsh
of youth
the balconies ablaze
summer beginning at its end
extraordinary hours those
when birds postponed rest because
of the next shift's insects
golden absorbed resounding
the hour when no one else lay down like me
the bicycle on the absence
and sat on the grass holding back tears
hands covering the face the face between the eyes and a
wheel spinning behind
there was no timely pocket screen
it was inevitable to face what cannot be fixed
nor ever will
it was the eloquent instant of the day
a harmonica crackled in the earphones
fatally wounded the afternoon's bull
that solitary buffalo that separates from the herd
to stay
the high lampposts lit up
there was a freshly painted wall
already dirty with a provincial graffiti
a dog passed by, lifted its snout towards the
scent of dinners
coming from where
the spread of TV sets could be seen
there was the ragged moon
like a cloth laid over the denim of the heights
harmonizing the arranged C's
in the box of the future
the ivy of extensions traversed that hour
an idea furrowed the celestial heath
the mountaineering heart inside out of the volumes
rarefied
the world was already a field of disgust
and abundance – beautiful disastrous fierce – place of forces
and destructions
I groped with closed eyes
purely intrinsic
searching for an urban barn to store
the gold-semen ready to detonate
the extreme dragonfly the initial cricket
the swallow whose nest results from a heap
of mud and dried herbs and rake
surfaces feeding in the air
on my back the scant refreshment
of the public library
at that hour den of hazy soldiers
resting from the guerrilla fight
hasta la derrota, siempre!
they inflicted minimal damage on a
clumsy but reluctant enemy
only those most melancholic like me
fell in ambushes
the visible eight still on the ground
plowed by the force of spinning in the same place
had dared to pierce the portal of infinity
always dying leaning over dinner",0

testados couros e ataduras
aprumados os cabelos

i’m watching her:
sweet the alp in the angle of her jaw
when she wakes
the canvas soaked at dawn
the grass outside darkens just as the sun rising
dilutes sleep
the mules feed off the fleeting
boreal pastures
before us a way opens up
luminously
glued to keeping quiet
to moving
but a breeze already inflames
making us want for a lake, placing
a range on the horizon
a less uncrossable elevation
than the lowlands of lived life
we say goodbye to the humid moss
fingered between thighs
stir the last pleasure out of the little
campfire that crackled
at the shelter’s opening through the long cold hours
we stuff rucksacks
leather and straps tested
we fixed our hair
munch a bit of flour
shredded bits of jerky
swigs of steaming coffee
we, the soldiers of alexander
whom nights of whiskey never fell
whose boots don’t weigh a thing
nor shame the fevers
the rectangle left by the tent
will remain for a while marking the plot of grass
stones ringing what had been
a scintillating flame later gone dark
now pasture to the scent of the timid
animals that will wander in
sounding out this sullied bit of the scene
at this very moment our scent
sails through narrow ravines
mixed with the dust and the clamor of hoofs that brings us
straying close on the edge of precipices
our own echoing
will embarrass us
but within – more silence even than the gorse
on the cliff sides –
and hardened, soaked with mist, atypical
arching over our maps
opening compasses
jotting quick notes about the way
and the error

I gaze upon her:
the sweet apex at the angle of her jaw
as she awakens
the canvas soaked in dawn
beyond, the grass stains as much as the starry vault
diluting the slumber
mules feeding on the fatuous
northern pastures
before us, a path articulates
illuminating
adhering to the silence
to the movement
yet already a breath ignites
restoring to us the desire for a lake, setting
the mountain range on the horizon
an elevation less impassable
than the plain of the lived
we bid farewell to the moist moss
traced between thighs
we shake off what remains of pleasure
the faint glow that at the shelter's mouth
creaked for long, cold hours
we stuff our backpacks
tested leathers and bindings
hair neatly arranged
we bring to our teeth a bit of flour
strands of dried meat
sips of steaming coffee
we, soldiers of Alexander
to whom the whiskey of evenings never fell
and the boots do not weigh
nor do the fevers shame
the rectangle where the tent lingered
will be marked for a time in the grass
with the stones surrounding what once was
the flickering flame that later darkened
and is fodder for the timid
fauna that will come
to probe this soiled part of the place
by then, our scent
will drift through ravines and gorges
mixed with dust and the clatter of hooves with which
we wander on the brink of abysses
we will produce echoes that our modesty
will shy away from
but within – more taciturn than the roar

das mães, afogavam-se em lama, no meio dos sambos. as paredes

para proteger o fogo nos altares e as crianças adoptaram a nudez.
as termiteiras deixaram de existir e as formigas aladas
perderam as asas. os pés dos mais-velhos fenderam-se em chagas
e as mamas das virgens, mal eram tocadas, colavam-se aos dedos
como cinza húmida. os lábios dos sexos das mulheres paridas
inchavam carnudos de uma carne branca e os ventres pendiam
como fruta mole.
naquele ano a chuva foi excessiva
e os horizontes deixaram de existir.
choveu por muito tempo até os cães perderem todo o pêlo
e as cabeleiras se destacarem como algas podres. o rei do jau
ficou colado ao trono e ao boi sagrado cresceram-lhe os olhos,
que depois cegaram. as sementes grelaram nos celeiros
e essa semente assim era servida aos homens e daí lhes ocorreu
um tal vigor que os seus sexos cresceram desmedidos
e os homens vacilaram, tendo-os nas mãos e mudos de fascínio.
a chuva choveu tanto que as serpentes saíram dos buracos
e vieram alongar-se ao pé dos paus, mantendo com esforço
as cabeças erguidas. nas terrinas do leite vicejavam musgos
e o leite das vacas alterou-se em soro, a coalhar na urina.
naquele ano a chuva choveu tanto que até nos areais cresceram
talos e as enxurradas produziram peixe e até o ferro se lavou
sozinho e os diamantes vieram rebolar nas pedras concavadas
de moer farinha. as próprias aves morreram quase todas
e apenas se salvaram as de penas brancas, que a distância atraiu,
depois comeu.
e aquela chuva aproveitou aos fósseis e houve minerais
que se animaram e até pedras comuns a transmudar-se em carne.
naquele ano a chuva choveu tanto que a memória perdeu todo
o sentido. as gargantas entupiram-se de limos
e as testas que os velhos pousavam nas mãos fundiam-se aos dedos
e os braços às pernas e os gestos de graça fundiam os corpos
e as jovens crianças ficavam coladas ao peito das mães.
só as bocas teimavam em manter-se abertas e quando mais tarde
a chuva parou, das bocas saíram grossas aves negras
que abalaram logo daquelas paragens. e a seca voltou
e o mundo secou. a carne antiga a dar-se agora em terra,
os fósseis em pedra e as ramas em húmus.
e os passos poliram pouco a pouco as formas.

that was the year that the rains were excessive and mushrooms grew
in dogs’ eyes. the young bulls, looking out at the light from their mother’s crotches, drowned in the mud, in the middle of the vines. the walls of the houses dissolved in cream and the potters no longer entrusted their work to god. enormous measures were invented
to protect the altar flames and the children started to run around naked.
the termitaries ceased to exist and winged ants lost their wings. the feet of the oldest ones split open in sores and the breasts of virgins, as soon as you touched them, stuck to your fingers like wet ash. the lips of the birthing womens’ sex swelled plumply like white meat and their bellies hung like soft fruit.
that was the year the rain was excessive and the horizon ceased to exist.
it rained forever until the dogs lost all their fur and people’s hair stuck out like rotten seaweed. the king of jau got stuck to his throne and the sacred bullock’s eyes grew larger, and then went blind. the seed sprouted in the granaries and then it was served up to the men, just like that, and they were infused with such vigor that their cocks grew immeasurably and they reeled about, with the things in their hands, mute with the magic.
the rain rained so much that the snakes left their snake-holes
and stretched out next to sticks, raising their heads
with only the greatest effort. moss multiplied in the tureens of milk
and the milk of cows turned to whey which curdled in urine.
that year the rain rained so much that even the beaches grew
branches and the rushing streams spawned fish and even the iron washed itself alone and diamonds started to tumble around the stones hollowed out for milling flour. the birds themselves nearly all died and the only ones that saved themselves were those with white feathers, which the distance attracted, then ate.
and the rain was good for fossils, and there were minerals
that came alive and even common stones that were transmuted into
flesh.
that year the rain rained so much that memory was rendered
meaningless. throats were clogged with sludge and the brows that the aged held in their hands fused with their fingers,
and their arms fused to their legs and their graceful gestures smelt their bodies and the youngest children ended up glued to their mothers’ breasts.
only our mouths dared to remain open and when the rain
finally stopped, huge black birds flew from them and disappeared into the distance. and the drought came back and the world dried out. now the ancient flesh has turned to dirt,
the fossils to stone and the branches to humus.

on this scorching day, I am waiting for the snow.
I have always been waiting for it.
as a boy, I read memories from the house of the dead
and saw the snow falling on the Siberian steppe

I love the snow because it does not separate day from night
nor distance the sky from the earth's afflictions.
it unites what is divided:
the steps of men condemned to darkened ice
and the sighs of love that dissipate in the air.
one must have a very keen ear
to hear the music of snow falling, something almost silent
like the brush of an angel's wing, if angels existed,
or the gasp of a bird.
one should not await snow as one awaits love.

i
ave-marias
nas nossas ruas, ao anoitecer,
há tal soturnidade, há tal melancolia,
que as sombras, o bulício, o tejo, a maresia
despertam-me um desejo absurdo de sofrer.
o céu parece baixo e de neblina,
o gás extravasado enjoa-me, perturba;
e os edifícios, com as chaminés, e a turba
toldam-se duma cor monótona e londrina.
batem carros de aluguer, ao fundo,
levando à via-férrea os que se vão. felizes!
ocorrem-me em revista exposições, países:
madrid, paris, berlim, s. petersburgo, o mundo!
semelham-se a gaiolas, com viveiros,
as edificações somente emadeiradas:
como morcegos, ao cair das badaladas,
saltam de viga em viga os mestres carpinteiros.
voltam os calafates, aos magotes,
de jaquetão ao ombro, enfarruscados, secos;
embrenho-me, a cismar, por boqueirões, por becos,
ou erro pelos cais a que se atracam botes.
e evoco, então, as crónicas navais:
mouros, baixéis, heróis, tudo ressuscitado!
luta camões no sul, salvando um livro a nado!
singram soberbas naus que eu não verei jamais!
e o fim da tarde inspira-me; e incomoda!
de um couraçado inglês vogam os escaleres;
e em terra num tinir de louças e talheres
flamejam, ao jantar alguns hotéis da moda.
num trem de praça arengam dois dentistas;
um trôpego arlequim braceja numas andas;
os querubins do lar flutuam nas varandas;
às portas, em cabelo, enfadam-se os lojistas!
vazam-se os arsenais e as oficinas;
reluz, viscoso, o rio, apressam-se as obreiras;
e num cardume negro, hercúleas, galhofeiras,
correndo com firmeza, assomam as varinas.
vêm sacudindo as ancas opulentas!
seus troncos varonis recordam-me pilastras;
e algumas, à cabeça, embalam nas canastras
os filhos que depois naufragam nas tormentas.
descalças! nas descargas de carvão,
desde manhã à noite, a bordo das fragatas;
e apinham-se num bairro aonde miam gatas,
e o peixe podre gera os focos de infecção!
ii
noite fechada
toca-se às grades, nas cadeias. som
que mortifica e deixa umas loucuras mansas!
o aljube, em que hoje estão velhinhas e crianças,
bem raramente encerra uma mulher de “dom”!
e eu desconfio, até, de um aneurisma
tão mórbido me sinto, ao acender das luzes;
à vista das prisões, da velha sé, das cruzes,
chora-me o coração que se enche e que se abisma.
a espaços, iluminam-se os andares,
e as tascas, os cafés, as tendas, os estancos
alastram em lençol os seus reflexos brancos;
e a lua lembra o circo e os jogos malabares.
duas igrejas, num saudoso largo,
lançam a nódoa negra e fúnebre do clero:
nelas esfumo um ermo inquisidor severo,
assim que pela história eu me aventuro e alargo.
na parte que abateu no terremoto,
muram-me as construções rectas, iguais, crescidas;
afrontam-me, no resto, as íngremes subidas,
e os sinos dum tanger monástico e devoto.
mas, num recinto público e vulgar,
com bancos de namoro e exíguas pimenteiras,
brônzeo, monumental, de proporções guerreiras,
um épico doutrora ascende, num pilar!
e eu sonho o cólera, imagino a febre,
nesta acumulação de corpos enfezados;
sombrios e espectrais recolhem os soldados;
inflama-se um palácio em face de um casebre.
partem patrulhas de cavalaria
dos arcos dos quartéis que foram já conventos;
idade média! a pé, outras, a passos lentos,
derramam-se por toda a capital, que esfria.
triste cidade! eu temo que me avives
uma paixão defunta! aos lampiões distantes,
enlutam-me, alvejando, as tuas elegantes,
curvadas a sorrir às montras dos ourives.
e mais: as costureiras, as floristas
descem dos magasins, causam-me sobressaltos;
custa-lhes a elevar os seus pescoços altos
e muitas delas são comparsas ou coristas.
e eu, de luneta de uma lente só,
eu acho sempre assunto a quadros revoltados:
entro na brasserie; às mesas de emigrados,
ao riso e à crua luz joga-se o dominó.

ao gás
e saio. a noite pesa, esmaga. nos
passeios de lajedo arrastam-se as impuras.
ó moles hospitais! sai das embocaduras
um sopro que arripia os ombros quase nus.
cercam-me as lojas, tépidas. eu penso
ver círios laterais, ver filas de capelas,
com santos e fiéis, andores, ramos, velas,
em uma catedral de um comprimento imenso.
as burguesinhas do catolicismo
resvalam pelo chão minado pelos canos;
e lembram-me, ao chorar doente dos pianos,
as freiras que os jejuns matavam de histerismo.
num cutileiro, de avental, ao torno,
um forjador maneja um malho, rubramente;
e de uma padaria exala-se, inda quente,
um cheiro salutar e honesto a pão no forno.
e eu que medito um livro que exacerbe,
quisera que o real e a análise mo dessem;
casas de confecções e modas resplandecem;
pelas vitrines olha um ratoneiro imberbe.
longas descidas! não poder pintar
com versos magistrais, salubres e sinceros,
a esguia difusão dos vossos reverberos,
e a vossa palidez romântica e lunar!
que grande cobra, a lúbrica pessoa,
que espartilhada escolhe uns xales com debuxo!
sua excelência atrai, magnética, entre luxo,
que ao longo dos balcões de mogno se amontoa.
e aquela velha, de bandós! por vezes,
a sua traîne imita um leque antigo, aberto,
nas barras verticais, a duas tintas. perto,
escarvam, à vitória, os seus mecklemburgueses.
desdobram-se tecidos estrangeiros;
plantas ornamentais secam nos mostradores;
flocos de pós de arroz pairam sufocadores,
e em nuvens de cetins requebram-se os caixeiros.
mas tudo cansa! apagam-se nas frentes
os candelabros, como estrelas, pouco a pouco;
da solidão regouga um cauteleiro rouco;
tornam-se mausoléus as armações fulgentes.
“dó da miséria!... compaixão de mim!...”
e, nas esquinas, calvo, eterno, sem repouso,
pede-me esmola um homenzinho idoso,
meu velho professor nas aulas de latim!

horas mortas
o tecto fundo de oxigénio, de ar,
estende-se ao comprido, ao meio das trapeiras;
vêm lágrimas de luz dos astros com olheiras,
enleva-me a quimera azul de transmigrar.
por baixo, que portões! que arruamentos!
um parafuso cai nas lajes, às escuras:
colocam-se taipais, rangem as fechaduras,
e os olhos dum caleche espantam-me, sangrentos.
e eu sigo, como as linhas de uma pauta
a dupla correnteza augusta das fachadas;
pois sobem, no silêncio, infaustas e trinadas,
as notas pastoris de uma longínqua flauta.
se eu não morresse, nunca! e eternamente
buscasse e conseguisse a perfeição das cousas!
esqueço-me a prever castíssimas esposas,
que aninhem em mansões de vidro transparente!
ó nossos filhos! que de sonhos ágeis,
pousando, vos trarão a nitidez às vidas!
eu quero as vossas mães e irmãs estremecidas,
numas habitações translúcidas e frágeis.
ah! como a raça ruiva do porvir,
e as frotas dos avós, e os nómadas ardentes,
nós vamos explorar todos os continentes
e pelas vastidões aquáticas seguir!
mas se vivemos, os emparedados,
sem árvores, no vale escuro das muralhas!...
julgo avistar, na treva, as folhas das navalhas
e os gritos de socorro ouvir estrangulados.
e nestes nebulosos corredores
nauseiam-me, surgindo, os ventres das tabernas;
na volta, com saudade, e aos bordos sobre as pernas,
cantam, de braço dado, uns tristes bebedores.
eu não receio, todavia, os roubos;
afastam-se, a distância, os dúbios caminhantes;
e sujos, sem ladrar, ósseos, febris, errantes,
amareladamente, os cães parecem lobos.
e os guardas, que revistam as escadas,
caminham de lanterna e servem de chaveiros;
por cima, as imorais, nos seus roupões ligeiros,
tossem, fumando sobre a pedra das sacadas.

vespers
when evening falls across our streets
and sullen melancholy fills the air,
the tagus, the tang, the shadows and bustle
bring me an absurd desire to suffer.
the sky hangs low and seems all hazy;
the gas from the streetlamps makes me queasy;
the tumult of buildings, chimneys and people
is cloaked in a dullish, londonish hue.
oh lucky travellers in hired coaches
now hieing to the railway station! countries
and exhibitions file past me: madrid,
paris, berlin, st petersburg, the world!
the timber frames of future buildings
resemble cages for keeping animals;
like swooping bats the carpenters leap
from beam to beam at the sound of the bell.
clusters of callous, tar-smeared caulkers
return from the slipways, coats on their shoulders;
i wander through alleys that lead to the river
or walk by the wharves where boats are docked.
i evoke the ocean chronicles: the moors,
old vessels and heroes – all resurrected!
shipwrecked camões swims his book to shore! (1)
great carracks that i’ll never see ride the waves!
the twilight inspires, and also disturbs me!
an english battleship launches its cutters
while swank hotels on land bedazzle
with china and flatware clinking at dinner.
two dentists argue inside a streetcar;
a clumsy clown is struggling on stilts;
children flit, like cherubs, on balconies;
hatless, bored shopkeepers wait at their doors!
the shipyards and workshops are emptying out;
the river glints thickly, the workwomen hurry;
and a black school of herculean fishwives
bursts out of nowhere, joking, laughing.
wagging sumptuous hips they come!
their manly torsos remind me of pillars;
and some, in the baskets on their heads,
rock sons who’ll one day drown in storms.
on frigates – barefoot! – they unload coal (2)
from dawn to dusk, then crowd together
in a neighbourhood where cats meow
and the rotting fish breed infection!
ii
after dark
prisoners bang on the bars of their cells –
a sound that rattles my nerves with shame!
the aljube jail, for old women and children,
rarely encloses a titled lady!
i feel so ill as the lights come on
i worry i might have an aneurysm;
the sight of the jails, crosses, cathedral,
fills and sinks my heart with tears.
one floor after another lights up,
and cafés, restaurants, tobacco and other shops
spread like a sheet their white reflections.
the moon brings jugglers, the circus, to mind.
on an ancient square two churches raise
the clergy’s black, funereal spectre;
i sketch there a lonely, dour inquisitor,
daring to extend myself into history.
in quarters which the earthquake flattened
equal, straight buildings wall me in; (3)
everywhere else i face steep streets
and the tolling of pious, monastic bells.
but gracing a common, public square
with lovers’ benches and lithe pepper trees
a war-sized monument cast in bronze
stands, on a pillar, for an epic that was! (4)
and in this assemblage of stunted bodies
i think of the fever, imagine the cholera;
returning soldiers look sombre as ghosts;
a gleaming palace stands opposite a hovel.
mounted patrolmen set out from the archways
of army barracks that once were convents;
the middle ages! others, on foot,
range through the capital, now turning cold.
sad town! i dread you’ll arouse a dead passion
in me! i mourn upon seeing your elegant
ladies so white in the lamp-lit distance,
leaning and smiling at jewellers’ windows.
coming down from the department stores,
the florists and dressmakers wrench my gut;
they’re hardly able to hold up their heads,
and many are walk-ons and chorus girls.
even in sordid human tableaus
i, with my pince-nez, find subject matter:
i enter the beerhouse; at the immigrants’ tables,
harshly lit, they laugh and play dominoes.
iii
by gaslight
and i go back out. the night’s weight crushes.
impure women roam the sidewalks.
o languid hospitals! ill-clad shoulders
shiver from drafts where streets open up.
warm shops surround me. i think i’m seeing
flanking candles, rows of chapels
with saints and the faithful, flowers, more candles,
more saints, in a vastly long cathedral.
the bourgeois women of catholicism
slip on the ground that’s tunnelled by drainpipes.
to me they recall, with their whining pianos,
the nuns who, fasting, died of madness.
an aproned knife maker, working the lathe,
redhotly wields his blacksmith’s hammer;
and bread, still warm, from the baker’s oven
sends forth its honest, wholesome smell.
and i, whose goal is a book that galls,
want it to show and examine what’s real.
boutiques shine with the latest fashions;
a street urchin gapes at their window displays.
o long descents! could i but paint
with skilled, sincere, salubrious verses
the delicate shimmering of your streetlamps
and all your romantic moonlit pallor!
that sensual, corseted creature selecting
printed shawls – she moves like a snake!
her excellence is a magnet amidst
the finery piled on mahogany counters.
and that old dame with coiled plaits!
her train with its vertical, two-tone stripes
mocks a spread fan! her mecklenburg horses
wait with the carriage, pawing the pavement.
decorative plants wilt on the tables
where clerks unroll their foreign fabrics;
in clouds of satins they bow and smile;
rice powder hovers and chokes the air.
but all grows weary! slowly, like stars,
the storefronts’ hanging lights go dim;
the glittering buildings become mausoleums;
a lone, hoarse voice hawks lottery tickets.
and there on a corner: “please, sir! take pity!”
whenever i pass him, that little old man,
bald and eternal, begs for alms:
the teacher at school who taught me latin!
iv
the dead hours
the lofty ceiling of air, of oxygen,
runs between the facing rooftops;
the stars’ tired eyes shed tears of light;
blue dreams of transmigration exalt me.
below all that, what portals! what streets!
i hear, in the dark, a screw hit the ground,
the clacking of shutters, the jangle of locks;
and the bloodshot eyes of a buggy scare me.
i follow, like lines on a music stave,
the stately double row of façades
while pastoral notes from a distant flute
trill, in the silence, a gloomy warning.
oh, if i’d never die! if forever
i’d seek and attain the perfection of things!
i lose myself envisioning wives
who chastely nest in clear-glass mansions!
dear sons! what swift dreams, alighting,
will bring sharp clarity to your lives!
i want the mothers and sisters you love
to live in luminous, fragile homes.
ah! like our grandfathers’ fleets, like fervent
nomads, like the ruddy race to come, (5)
we’ll go and explore every continent
and sail across the watery expanses!
but how, if we live enclosed by stone
in a dark and treeless valley of walls?
i think i see knives flash in the shadows
and hear a strangled cry for help.
and along these murky corridors
the taverns, if i peer in, appall me.
some sorry drunks are staggering home
and sing, arms joined, for old time’s sake.
but i’m not afraid of being robbed;
the dubious characters fall behind me.
the scrawny and mangy dogs don’t bark;
they look a little like yellowish wolves.
and those keepers of keys, the night watchmen,
scan with their lanterns each entryway;
above them loose women, in scanty robes,
smoke and cough at the balcony windows.
and looming out of that jagged mass
of tomblike buildings tall as hills,
human pain, like a baleful sea,
seeks vast horizons for its bitter tides!",pt_XX,en_XX,"the sentiment of a westerner

hail marys
in our streets, at nightfall,
such gloom, such melancholy,
that shadows, the bustle, the tejo, the sea air
awaken in me an absurd desire to suffer.
the sky seems low and misty,
the escaping gas sickens me, disturbs me;
and the buildings, with the chimneys, and the crowd
are veiled in a monotonous and london-like hue.
rental cars honk in the distance,
taking those who go. happy!
exhibitions, countries come to mind:
madrid, paris, berlin, st. petersburg, the world!
the buildings, only wooden structures,
resemble cages with aviaries:
like bats, at the tolling of the bells,
the master carpenters leap from beam to beam.
the caulkers return in droves,
with their jackets slung over their shoulders, charred and dry;
i wander, lost in thought, through alleyways, through lanes,
or wander along the docks where boats dock.
and then i evoke naval chronicles:
moors, galleys, heroes, all resurrected!
camões fights in the south, saving a book by swimming!
magnificent ships set sail that i will never see!
and the end of the evening inspires me; and troubles me!
from a british battleship row the cutters;
and on land, in the clattering of dishes and cutlery,
some trendy hotels blaze at dinner.
in a square, two dentists argue;
a stumbling harlequin brandishes crutches;
the cherubs of home float on balconies;
at the doors, the shopkeepers grow weary in their hair!
the arsenals and workshops empty out;
the river glistens, viscous, the workers hurry;
and in a black shoal, herculean, jocular,
running with determination, the fishwives emerge.
swaying their opulent hips!
their manly trunks remind me of pillars;
and some, balancing on their heads, cradle in baskets
the children who later perish in storms.
barefoot! in the coal unloading areas,
from morning till night, aboard the frigates;
they crowd into a district where cats meow,
and rotten fish breeds infection!

ii

deep night
knocks on the bars, in the prisons. a sound
that torments and leaves a gentle madness!
the aljube, where today there are old women and children,
rarely holds a woman of ""dom""!
and i even suspect an aneurysm
i feel so morbid, as the lights come on;
at the sight of prisons, the old cathedral, the crosses,
my heart weeps, filling and sinking.
at intervals, the floors light up,
and the taverns, cafes, shops, and tobacco shops
spread their white reflections like a sheet;
and the moon recalls the circus and the juggling games.
two churches, in a nostalgic square,
cast the black and funereal stain of the clergy:
in them i conjure up a severe inquisitorial hermit,
whenever i venture into and expand history.
in the part that collapsed in the earthquake,
the straight, identical buildings wall me in;
the steep climbs challenge me in the rest,
and the bells toll in a monastic and devout tone.
but in a public and mundane setting,
with courting benches and small pepper trees,
bronze, monumental, of warlike proportions,
a former epic ascends on a column!
and i dream of cholera, imagine fever,
in this accumulation of sickly bodies;
dark and spectral, the soldiers withdraw;
a palace burns across from a hovel.
cavalry patrols depart
from the arches of the former convent barracks;
middle ages! some on foot, others at a slow pace,
spread through the entire cooling capital.

a dead passion in me! in the distance, the lampposts
mourn, casting light on your elegant figures,
bent and smiling at the jewelers' shop windows.
and more: the seamstresses, the florists
descend from the shops, startling me;
it's hard for them to lift their high necks,
and many of them are actresses or chorus girls.
and i, with a single-lens opera glass,
always find material for rebellious scenes;
i enter a brasserie; at the tables of emigrants,
dominoes are played amidst laughter and harsh light.

by gaslight
and i leave. the night weighs heavy, crushing. on
the cobblestone sidewalks the impure drag themselves.
o soft hospitals! from the doorways
a breath chills bare shoulders.
the shops surround me, warm. i imagine
side altars, rows of chapels,
with saints and worshippers, processions, branches, candles,
in a cathedral of immense length.
the catholic bourgeois girls
traverse a minefield littered with pipes;
and they remind me, as they cry over sick pianos,
of the nuns who died of hysteria from fasting.
in a cutlery shop, the blacksmith at his forge,
wields a hammer with a red-hot intensity;
and from a bakery, still warm,
a healthy and honest smell of baking bread wafts.
and as i contemplate a book that magnifies,
i wish reality and analysis would offer it to me;
houses of fashion and style gleam;
a young pickpocket eyes the windows.
long descents! unable to paint
with masterful, wholesome verses,
the slender diffusion of your reflections,
and your romantic, lunar paleness!
what a grand serpent, the lustful person,
who, corseted, selects shawls with patterns!
their allure draws one magnetically, amid luxury,
that accumulates along the mahogany counters.
and that old woman, with her hair in rolls! sometimes,
her train mimics an ancient, open fan,
in vertical bars, in two shades. nearby,
their mecklenburg men scratch at victory.
foreign fabrics are unfurled;
ornamental plants wither on display;
powder flakes hover oppressively,
and in clouds of satin, the shop assistants sway.
but everything tires! the candelabras
dim in the storefronts, like stars, little by little;
a hoarse ticket seller grumbles in solitude;
the glistening frames become mausoleums.
""pity for misery!... compassion for me!...""
and at the corners, a bald, eternal man, restless,
asks me for alms, an old man,
my latin teacher from school!

iv

dead hours
the deep oxygen ceiling, the air,
stretches lengthwise, through the attic;
tearful light streams from starry eyes,
the blue chimera of transmigration enchants me.
below, what gates! what streets!
a screw falls on the dark slabs:
fences are erected, locks creak,
and the eyes of a carriage startle me, bloodshot.
and i follow, like the lines of a score,
the august dual flow of facades;
for in the silence, a pastoral and trilled melody
rises",0

aproveitando a sombra débil e ambulante.
sentado na boleia, as rédeas na mão morena
descuidadas, um homem cisma, confia
do caminho ao macho lento a decisão.
outros homens a pé e mulheres novas
entretêm de riso a caminhada espessa.
logo após, sobre os burros, os pertences.

e os aldeões, em pânico secreto,
os expulsam com voz impiedosa e decidida mão

têm por costume, depois de embriagados,
trocar com as bengalas possantes e vistosas

dizem que vivem estranhos dramas passionais.
dizem que não têm deus e que se casam
lançando ao ar jubilosos chapéus.

slackly holding the reins, a man daydreams,
trusting the slow mule to lead the way.

a few oldsters tired of everything. nursing infants
suck with drowsy stubbornness at teats

happy the man who never places
his small and humble fantasy
in anything greater than simply leading
his cattle to drink from the cold spring
and drawing their milk so that he can drink!
however fortune may stir things up,
he’ll never feel any greater grief
than the weight of knowing his life is brief.
he’ll see the rising sun’s red face
and see the clear spring always flowing,
not wondering where the water comes from
nor who on the horizon hides the light.
playing the flute where his cattle graze,
he’ll know the grass that covers the hill;
in god he’ll simply and calmly believe,
not pondering truths he can’t conceive.
among the things of antiquity,
it’s written of a certain thrasyllus
that, due to a grave infirmity,
he lost his senses for a long season,
during which time, bereft of reason,
he claimed and believed that all the ships
which at the port of piraeus landed
were ships he owned if not commanded.
he took himself for a mighty lord
and enjoyed as well a happy life,
since he lost nothing when ships were lost,
and rejoiced for those that landed safely.
time went by till one day crito
his brother returned after a long absence
and, seeing how thrasyllus had lost his wits,
was moved by fraternal love to pity.
he gave him to doctors, charging them
to perform the cure thus far refused.
alas! by restoring his brother’s senses,
he robbed him of his sweet easy life!
the herbs of apollo, without delay,
gave him back his former health.
now of sound mind, thrasyllus thanked
his brother for caring, not for his act.
for when he saw himself in danger
of the toils that sanity would impose
and saw no more that state of privilege
conferred on him by his fantasy,
he sighed: “o enemy brother, pretended
friend, why did you take from me
that life so calm and free of pains,
which can’t be had by anyone sane?
“what king, or duke or mighty lord
would i have wished to trade places with?
what did i care if the world ended
or if nature’s order suddenly changed?
now dear life is a heavy burden,
for i know what toil and sadness are.
restore me to that state of bliss;
the only sane condition is madness.”",pt_XX,en_XX,"On the Disarray of the World (excerpt)

He who kept his fancy so lowly
That in grander matters never delved,
But merely led his cattle to drink slowly
And milked them, taking what he beheld!
How blessed a life he'd live solely
For no matter how Fortune swirled and whirled,
He'd never feel a greater sorrow inside
Than mourning life's small size with pride.

He'd watch the sun lift its purple face,
He'd watch the clear stream dance and prance,
Without pondering the water's birthplace,
Nor who hides the light in the far expanse.
Playing the flute where his cattle graze,
He'd know the herbs on the mountain's expanse;
In God he'd believe, simple and still,
Without probing any secret will.

Of a certain Trasílaus we read and weave,
Among the tales of yore's antiquity,
Who lost his wits for a time, believe,
Due to a grave infirmity;
And while he wandered, quite naive,
He believed with stubborn sincerity,
That the ships anchoring in the port pirean,
Were his, in his mad delirium.

He would have been a lord most grand
(Besides the joyful life he led),
For those lost, he'd not lose his stand,
And for those saved, he'd rejoice instead.
Not long after, one day so bland,
His brother Criton, who had fled,
Returned; seeing his lost brother's plight,
He was moved by fraternal love's light.

To the doctors he entrusts him, with a plea
To restore him to his former wit.
Sad that, to bring back his clarity,
They take away his peaceful life so fit!
Suddenly, Apollo's herbs set free
His health, as before, in a swift fit.
Trasílaus, wise, thanks his dear kin,
For the will, not the deed, from within.

For after facing the danger stark
Of the toils his sanity bestowed,
And after not finding the old spark
That vain opinions had bestowed,
""Oh, treacherous brother, with friendly mark!
Why did you take me from the abode
Of a tranquil life, free and serene,
Which no sage could have ever seen?

Why exchange me for king or duke,
Or lord of a grand fortress so wide?
What care I if the world rebukes,
Or if nature's order twisted or tried?
Now life's dear weight my heart rebukes;
I know now what toil and sadness abide.
Restore me to my former state, I entreat,
For in madness alone does wisdom meet.""",0

my brief time passes before my eyes;
i mourn the past in whatever i say,
as each day passes, step by step;
youth deserts me; what persists is pain.

that not for an hour in so long a life
could i give evil so much as a side step!
surely, i’m better dead than alive?

having failed to be cheated by my own eyes?

must advance to close these sad eyes

could find a pen to declare i’m alive.

they would now have made ashes of my pain;

i’m softened by the tears of those eyes

A life has never seen such a long duration
in which a step towards evil can be taken.

when, at night, a dog howls,
as if its flesh
were not flesh of its own flesh,
but a thick veil
that covers the pain
and makes it more intense?
a window opens wide,
and I chase the furrows and the wrath
of that mystical dog,
of that dog that exists somewhere
beyond sight.
the night I ignored becomes visible,
but not the wrath, the absolute wrath of the dog,
even though my eyes
blind in an exasperating desire
for light.",0

"o caminho de ohrid*
do alto das muralhas de ohrid onde
acorrera aos gritos desvairados dos vigias,
o rei samuel avistou o seu exército desfigurado,
arrastando-se entre as montanhas da macedónia.
aos catorze mil homens tinham sido
arrancados os olhos por ordem do imperador
e a um em cada cem mandara ele, basílio ii,
fosse poupado um olho para conduzirem o regresso
dessa manada cega. depois de atravessarem altas neves
vinham-se agora despenhando para o lago,
tropeçando, agarrados uns aos outros,
a tortura espelhada nas contorções das faces,
o sangue a empapar-lhes os andrajos. e o rei,
tomado pela angústia, deu um grito de dor e morreu
no alto da muralha sobre a colina e os seus bosques e pomares
que o lago placidamente reflectia.
nesse instante compreendeu como era ambígua
a força cega do destino e em nenhum mosteiro
podia a iconostase explicar-lhe esse cruel mistério:
os santos, com feições dos retratos do fayoum,
entre as chamas trémulas emudeciam
nos seus frescos e as vozes dos jovens monges,
no seu canto austero e imperturbado,
elevavam uma grave primavera na penumbra.","the road to ohrid*
from the heights of the walls of ohrid
to where he’d run upon hearing the screams

army dragging through the macedonian mountains.
the eyes of the fourteen thousand men had been
gouged by order of the emperor, basil the second,
who had instructed that one eye be spared in every
hundredth man so that they could lead the return
of that blind herd. having crossed over the high snows
they now came rushing down toward the lake,
stumbling and grabbing on to one another,
the torture mirrored in their facial contortions,
blood soaking their tattered clothes, and the king,
seized by anguish, uttered a shout of grief and died
on the heights of the walls over the hill and his forests and groves
which the lake so peacefully reflected.
in that instant he understood just how ambiguous
the blind force of destiny was, and in no monastery
could the screens of icons have elucidated that cruel mystery:
the saints, whose faces resembled fayumic portraits,
remained silent in their frescos amid the flickering
flames, and the voices of the young monks,

"um cão para pompeia
aos amantes enlaçados contraponho
um cão de pompeia, decerto ele andaria
a brincar junto ao forum, à cata de algum osso,
quando o vesúvio o caçou, mais lesto,
para moldá-lo em pedra-pomes.
insisto em vê-lo como um bicho magro e descuidado,
de penúria diuturna. passou de leve
pelos peristilos, alheio ao luxo, à corrupção,
à astrologia, e nunca dos triclínios
lhe caiu um naco envenenado, nunca se tornou
nem animal simbólico, nem mito que ganisse.
nunca foi encontrado nas escavações, mas é para aqui chamado.

que alçava a perna como todos os cães
e ladrava e mordia quando era preciso.
fazia pela vida e, fauno das esquinas, pelas cadelas no cio.
alguma tabuleta diria cave canem em tésseras minúsculas,
sem alaridos da história, e só sobreviveu
nos livros de latim expurgados, misturada
com a guerra das gálias e alguns nomes de deuses.

um rafeiro vulgar, digamos, de plínio

talvez uivando, uns dias depois dele.
“você é um cerebral”, disse-me cloé, flava e enervada.

e o amor e a morte sempre foram pensáveis”.

for whom poverty was a way of life. he skipped
through peristyles, a stranger to luxury, to corruption
to astrology, and no poisoned morsel ever befell him

assomas no arco da porta com teu rosto de cera
e seguras o colar num gesto extravagante,
defendida de mais uma piada suburbana.
“espera-te o museu”, ia dizer, numa derrisão fatal.
a palavra é recolher sem perda de tempo
e tudo receber com uma última aclamação.
rufam tambores, querida, como nos tempos
antigos, ébrios de sangue, chamando-nos
à cerimónia sacrificial. o rosto que nos promete
o televisor, vê, tem algo de ancestral e terrífico
quando o vemos a meio da fatídica arenga.
mutismo. em casa não temos almofada de joelhos
e a segurança, já o sabemos, é o teu sonho preferido,
se te debruças para os toldos e a linha da água.
vais até à varanda como testemunha ocular dos fogos
que se acendem, inelutavelmente, na distância.
vejo como o medo em ti cinzela uma estátua
de olhar velado e face muda, inexpressiva,
recolhida, como estás, dentro de ti,
ao esconderijo mais abstruso de todos.

chegados um ao outro, felizes se ouvimos
um ruído clamoroso na distância, olhamo-nos,
pois cumprida é a promessa, o sacramento
de ordem com que fomos investidos pelo tempo.
que fazer, perguntas. içar o velame
ou escavar em casa a galeria de mina,
desertando os dois, por um fuso horário,
na descida para os antípodas do mundo?
tomar um revulsivo ou deixarmo-nos ir,
movidos pelo vento, sob a aba dos telhados?
nada poderás levar, num último arrebatamento.
tu mesma serás presa, na tarde momentosa,
de quando foi desejo teu e perdes sem apelo
sob a lei da plebe ou uma qualquer ordem
pretoriana, sentenciada ao motivo bíblico
e à resignação de uma existência romana.
hoje tens só a imitação do teu rosto
no espelho. e nada mais te cumpre defender
à hora de sublevarem-se as obras de deus

you loom in the doorway with your waxen face,
flamboyantly clutching your necklace
like a shield against one more suburban joke.
“rehearsing for the museum?” i thought to shoot.
the order of the day is to retreat in haste
and to salute everything with a last hurrah.
drums are rolling, dear, as in olden times, drunk
with blood, calling us to the sacrificial rite.
there’s something ancestral and terrifying
about the face the television promises, look,
in the middle of its ominous harangue.
no comment. we don’t have kneeling pads
at home, and if you lean out to the umbrellas along
the shore, we know security is your preferred dream.
you go to the balcony as an eyewitness of the fires
inevitably blazing in the distance.

with veiled gaze and a speechless,
expressionless face, withdrawn into you,
the most recondite hiding place of all.

together now, happy if we hear a racket
in the distance, we look at each other,
for the promise is fulfilled, the ritual
sacrament conferred on us by time.
what should we do, you ask. hoist the sails
or dig a mine shaft in the floor, deserting
who we are as we descend time’s tunnel
to reach the world’s antipodes?
swallow a pill or let ourselves go,
pushed by the wind, beneath the eaves?
you cannot, in a final rapture, take anything.
you’ll be the prey, on that crucial day,
of all you desired and lose, without appeal,
under mob rule or some praetorian
order, sentenced to biblical logic
and the resignation of roman existence.
