"cabeça, tronco e membros
a camisa branca estendida na corda
do quintal é uma nuvem. há pouco,
quando a fui pendurar, ainda chovia.
agora, que o vento sopra forte dentro
dela, vejo de repente o teu tronco a
vesti-la. porém, se estendo os braços
para ele, só encontro o vazio. triste,
tento dizer-me que é apenas uma
camisa; mas, sem querer, volto
para casa com a nuvem na cabeça.","head, torso, and limbs
the white shirt hanging on the clothesline
in the backyard is a cloud. earlier,
when i went to hang it, it was still raining.
now, with the wind billowing inside
of it, i suddenly see your torso
underneath. but if i stretch my arms
toward it, all i find is emptiness. distressed,
i try to tell myself it’s only a
shirt; but, without meaning to, i go
back inside with the cloud in my head.",pt_XX,en_XX,"head, torso, and limbs
the white shirt stretched on the line
in the backyard is a cloud. just now,
when I went to hang it, it was still raining.
now, as the wind blows strongly within
it, I suddenly see your torso
wearing it. yet, when I reach out my arms
toward it, I find only emptiness. sadly,
I try to convince myself it's just a
shirt; but unintentionally, I return
home with the cloud in my head.",1
"antre mi mesmo em mim
não sei que se alevantou
que tão meu inimigo sou
uns tempos com grande engano
vivi eu mesmo comigo
agora no maior perigo
se me descobriu mor dano
caro custou um desengano
e pois m’este não matou
assaz caro me custou
de mim sou feito alheo

está um mal derramado
que por meu grão mal me veo
nova dor novo arreceo
foi este que me matou
que tão meu inimigo sou","between myself and me
between myself and me
i don’t know what’s emerged
to make me my own enemy.
for a time i lived as a fool,
at peace with myself.
now i see the great harm
a great danger can wreak.
disillusion costs dearly:
so costly was my latest
disillusion, it didn’t kill me.
i’m a stranger to myself.
my cruel fate is dispersed
in sorrow after sorrow,
cruelly sent my way.
fresh pain, fresh fear
have taken ahold of me.
here i am, trapped.",pt_XX,en_XX,"betwixt myself within
I know not what arose
that I am now my own foe

I myself with myself deceived
now in the greatest peril

dearly paid for the disillusion
and since it did not kill me
dearly did it cost me
of myself I'm made a stranger
between concern and concern
lies a malice spilled
that for my great harm came upon me
new pain, new dread
it was this that slew me
that I am now my own foe",1
"mcmlxxxvi
metade solar outra metade
adentrada na noite que divide e reparte irmãmente os dois
pedaços da mesma ideia:
redonda achatada nos polos insegura no seu tombo
escuridão afora
a cabeça pendular metida entre ombros
sombras
na órbita do absurdo a cumprir a curvatura que lhe cabe
errando distorcendo a silenciosa
nitidez dos hemisférios
enfeitada de gázeos, orifícios, rodeada
de visíveis
desprendem-se dela panoramas que flutuam até
muito depois, tortuosos
brincando de se mostrar de se encobrir na açoteia
dos eventos
onde uma língua lambe partículas, intenta locuções
ou a mudez dos vaga-lumes
mas tudo de tudo se afasta
por mais que um braço nosso se retese para o nada
partindo do centro, desalcançando
e o todo se despenhe, móbil
veloz rebobinado, o retroverso inteiro, e vejamos passar
pelo buraco de uma agulha o camelo
do raciocínio
e neva nesta geometria
tanto
resplandece muito como se às mãos um lume
viesse entreter as trevas
estamos assim sobre o rosto da terra
queimando as ervas
enterrando os sinais
inclinando a esfera do pensamento para a água
seguimos por pequenas pistas ano a ano
menos nítidas
o sono alaga submerge com um peso nocturno
o corpo treme de anonimato
é no sossego de um quarto extinto rumoroso
que a nossa esfera abate na mole dos seus fantasmas
o tecto abre ao incêndio celeste
a outra e à única claridade
e nesse vácuo ou abertura nesse
floco de neve ampliado uma magnólia floresce e floresce
a sequóia imensa do mundo recolhe
à potestade
enquanto o lugar das medidas dos medos e das merdas
arrefece na lâmpada do tecto
aquietam-se em ocultas complexidões as ondas
órfãs do disjuntor
frequentam vibrações fabulares exteriores à evidência
declinam
e o adágio em que demoliu a luz
acendeu na respiração profunda dos alvéolos
enquanto uma frágil estrela se acende no azul
para um percival de olhos fechados","mcmlxxxvi
half solar the other half
plunged in night that divides and fraternally shares two
scraps of the same idea:
round flattened at the poles insecure in its fall
out of darkness
the pendular head sunk between shoulders
shadows
the orbit of the absurd fulfilling its incumbent curvature
wandering distorting the silent
clarity of hemispheres
festooned in eyes of beryl, orifices, surrounded
by visibilities
panoramas breaking off that linger
long afterwards, coiling
a game of veiling and unveiling on the rooftop terrace
of events
where a tongue licks particles, proffers phrases
or the muteness of fireflies
but everything scatters from everything else
even though we thrust an arm into the void
out from the center, it’s thwarted
and everything crashes, velocious
mobile rewinding, an utter retroversion, and we can see
the camel of reason
pass through the eye of a needle
and it snows in this geometry
such
resplendence really as though a flame were handed to us
to fill the darkness
this is how we are upon the the face of the earth
burning the weeds
burying the signs
tipping the sphere of thinking into the water
each year we go down a series of narrow paths
ever dimmer
inundated, sleep is submerged under nocturnal weight
the body shudders with anonymity
it’s in the calm of a room humming with death
that our sphere falls into its crowd of ghosts
the ceiling opens on the celestial fire
on a different, a singular clarity
and in this emptiness, this opening, in this
high burgeoning snowflake a magnolia blooms and blooms
the immense sequoia of the world retires
to its dominion
while dimensions of fear and crap cool in their own venue
the naked bulb in the middle of the ceiling
the orphan waves of the circuit breaker are hushed
in hidden complexities
attend to fable-like vibrations beyond evidence
fade
and the adagio that demolished the light
erupted in the heavy breath of alveoli
as a fragile star lit up in the blue
for a percival with closed eyes",pt_XX,en_XX,"MCMLXXXVI
half solar the other half
entering the night that divides and shares brotherly the two
pieces of the same idea:
round flattened at the poles unsure in its fall
darkness beyond
the pendulum head tucked between shoulders
shadows
in the orbit of the absurd fulfilling the curvature that belongs to it
wandering distorting the silent
clarity of the hemispheres
adorned with gaseous, orifices, surrounded
by visible
panoramas detach from it floating until
much later, tortuous
playing to show itself to hide in the rooftop
of events
where a tongue licks particles, tries locutions
or the silence of fireflies
but everything drifts away from everything
even if one of our arms stretches out to nothing
starting from the center, unreachable
and all collapses, mobile
fast rewound, the whole retroverse, and we see passing
through the eye of a needle the camel
of reasoning
and it snows in this geometry
so much
shines brightly as if a flame
came to entertain the darkness in our hands
we are thus on the face of the earth
burning the herbs
burying the signs
tilting the sphere of thought towards the water
we follow year by year through small tracks
less clear
sleep floods submerges with a nocturnal weight
the body trembles with anonymity
it is in the quiet of a room extinct rumorous
that our sphere collapses in the mass of its ghosts
the ceiling opens to the celestial fire
the other and only clarity
and in that void or opening in that
amplified snowflake a magnolia blooms and blooms
the immense sequoia of the world gathers
to the power
while the place of measures of fears and shits
cools in the ceiling lamp
hidden complexities quiet in the waves
orphans of the breaker
frequent fabulous vibrations external to evidence
diminish
and the adage in which the light was demolished
lit in the deep breath of the alveoli
while a fragile star lights up in the blue
for a Percival with closed eyes",1

"menos para ti
