"da menina e moça
pensando-vos estou filha
vossa mãe me está lembrando
enchem-se-me os olhos d’água
nela vos estou lavando:
nascestes filha antre mágoa
para bem filha vos seja
que no vosso nascimento
vos ouve a fortuna inveja:
morto era o contentamento
nenhuma alegria ouvistes,
vossa mãe era finada,
nos outras éamos tristes:
nada em dor em dor crescida
não sei onde isto há de ir ter
vejo-vos filha fermosa
cos olhos verdes crescer:
não era esta graça vossa
para nascer em desterro
mal haja a desaventura
que pôs mais nisto que o erro:
tinha aqui sua sepultura
vossa mãe e mágoa a nós
não éreis vos filha não
para morrerem por vós:
não houve em fados razão
nem se consente rogar
de vosso pai hei mor dó
que de si s’á de queixar:
eu vos ouvi a vós só
primeiro que outrem ninguém
não fôreis vós seu não fora
não sei se fiz mal se bem:
mas não pode ser senhora
para mal nenhum nascerdes
com este riso gracioso
que tendes sobr’olhos verdes:
conforto mais duvidoso
me é este que tomo assi
deus voos dê milhor ventura
da que tevestes té ‘qui:
que a dita e a fermosura
dizem patranhas antigas
que pelejaram um dia
sendo dantes muito amigas:
muitos hão que é fantasia
eu que vi tempos e anos
nenhuma cousa duvido
como ela é caso de danos:
mas nenhum mal nom é crido
o bem só é esperado
e na crença e na esperança
em ambas há i mudança
em ambas há i cuidado","from menina e moça
i’m thinking of you, dear girl,
your mother’s memory haunts me.
my eyes fill up with tears,
they are bathing you gently.
you were born amid sorrow—
may it yet prove a blessing.
since fortune, struck with envy,
singled you out at birth.
gone forever was contentment,
you heard no joyful voices.
your mother’s life had ended,
while ours went on in sadness.
in anguish born and raised!
i don’t know where all this is going.
i’ve watched you grow, my girl,
with green eyes so lovely.
beauty like yours wasn’t meant
to be born in exile. curses on
fate! this was clearly a work
of malevolence, not a mistake.
here lies your mother,
and we languish in grief.
you did nothing, my girl,
to incur a loss so great.
the fates spurn reason,
and will admit no protest.
i pity your poor father,
for the pain he must lament.
i heard you crying, alone,
before anyone else. you’d not
be here, had i not been there.
still, i ask if i did right.
but surely it can’t be wrong
for you to have been born
with that elegant smile of yours,
those dazzling green eyes.
it’s an unlikely comfort
that i take for myself.
may god grant you the grace
that has eluded you till now.
beauty and good fortune,
or so the old story goes,
were once the best of friends,
but became bitterly opposed.
many hold that it’s fantasy,
but in my life i’ve seen
enough not to doubt it:
fate inflicts great damage.
no harm is ever believed;
we always expect the good.
in hoping and believing
lies an element of change,
an element of concern.",pt_XX,en_XX,"of the girl and lass
thinking of you I am daughter
your mother is reminding me
my eyes fill with tears
washing you in her
you were born amidst sorrow
may it be for your good daughter
that at your birth
fortune envied you:
contentment was dead
you heard no joy,
your mother had passed away,
we were all sad:
nothing grown in pain
I don't know where this will lead
I see you, beautiful daughter
growing with green eyes:
this grace was not yours
to be born in exile
ill be the misfortune
that put more into this than error:
your mother had her grave here
and sorrow for us
you were not daughter, no
for them to die for you:
there was no reason in fate
nor is it allowed to plead
for your father I have more pity
than for himself to complain:
I listened to you alone
before anyone else
you were not theirs, it wasn't
I don't know if I did wrong or right:
but it cannot be madam
for you to be born to any harm
with this gracious smile
that you have beneath green eyes:
more doubtful comfort
this that I take like this
may God give you better fortune
than what you've had so far:
for happiness and beauty
old tales say lies
that once they fought
when they were once very friendly:
many think it's fantasy
I, who have seen times and years
doubt nothing
as it is a case of losses:
but no evil is believed
only good is expected
and in belief and hope
in both there is change
in both there is care",1

naquele ano a chuva foi excessiva e cresceram tortulhos
nos olhos dos cães. os vitelos, ao espreitar a luz pelos sexos
das mães, afogavam-se em lama, no meio dos sambos. as paredes
das casas diluíam-se em nata e os oleiros desistiram de encomendar
a sua obra a deus. enormes cuidados foram inventados
para proteger o fogo nos altares e as crianças adoptaram a nudez.
as termiteiras deixaram de existir e as formigas aladas
perderam as asas. os pés dos mais-velhos fenderam-se em chagas
e as mamas das virgens, mal eram tocadas, colavam-se aos dedos
como cinza húmida. os lábios dos sexos das mulheres paridas
inchavam carnudos de uma carne branca e os ventres pendiam
como fruta mole.
naquele ano a chuva foi excessiva
e os horizontes deixaram de existir.
choveu por muito tempo até os cães perderem todo o pêlo
e as cabeleiras se destacarem como algas podres. o rei do jau
ficou colado ao trono e ao boi sagrado cresceram-lhe os olhos,
que depois cegaram. as sementes grelaram nos celeiros
e essa semente assim era servida aos homens e daí lhes ocorreu
um tal vigor que os seus sexos cresceram desmedidos
e os homens vacilaram, tendo-os nas mãos e mudos de fascínio.
a chuva choveu tanto que as serpentes saíram dos buracos
e vieram alongar-se ao pé dos paus, mantendo com esforço
as cabeças erguidas. nas terrinas do leite vicejavam musgos
e o leite das vacas alterou-se em soro, a coalhar na urina.
naquele ano a chuva choveu tanto que até nos areais cresceram
talos e as enxurradas produziram peixe e até o ferro se lavou
sozinho e os diamantes vieram rebolar nas pedras concavadas
de moer farinha. as próprias aves morreram quase todas
e apenas se salvaram as de penas brancas, que a distância atraiu,
depois comeu.
e aquela chuva aproveitou aos fósseis e houve minerais
que se animaram e até pedras comuns a transmudar-se em carne.
naquele ano a chuva choveu tanto que a memória perdeu todo
o sentido. as gargantas entupiram-se de limos
e as testas que os velhos pousavam nas mãos fundiam-se aos dedos
e os braços às pernas e os gestos de graça fundiam os corpos
e as jovens crianças ficavam coladas ao peito das mães.
só as bocas teimavam em manter-se abertas e quando mais tarde
a chuva parou, das bocas saíram grossas aves negras
que abalaram logo daquelas paragens. e a seca voltou
e o mundo secou. a carne antiga a dar-se agora em terra,
os fósseis em pedra e as ramas em húmus.
e os passos poliram pouco a pouco as formas.

that was the year that the rains were excessive and mushrooms grew
in dogs’ eyes. the young bulls, looking out at the light from their mother’s crotches, drowned in the mud, in the middle of the vines. the walls of the houses dissolved in cream and the potters no longer entrusted their work to god. enormous measures were invented
to protect the altar flames and the children started to run around naked.
the termitaries ceased to exist and winged ants lost their wings. the feet of the oldest ones split open in sores and the breasts of virgins, as soon as you touched them, stuck to your fingers like wet ash. the lips of the birthing womens’ sex swelled plumply like white meat and their bellies hung like soft fruit.
that was the year the rain was excessive and the horizon ceased to exist.
it rained forever until the dogs lost all their fur and people’s hair stuck out like rotten seaweed. the king of jau got stuck to his throne and the sacred bullock’s eyes grew larger, and then went blind. the seed sprouted in the granaries and then it was served up to the men, just like that, and they were infused with such vigor that their cocks grew immeasurably and they reeled about, with the things in their hands, mute with the magic.
the rain rained so much that the snakes left their snake-holes
and stretched out next to sticks, raising their heads
with only the greatest effort. moss multiplied in the tureens of milk
and the milk of cows turned to whey which curdled in urine.
that year the rain rained so much that even the beaches grew
branches and the rushing streams spawned fish and even the iron washed itself alone and diamonds started to tumble around the stones hollowed out for milling flour. the birds themselves nearly all died and the only ones that saved themselves were those with white feathers, which the distance attracted, then ate.
and the rain was good for fossils, and there were minerals
that came alive and even common stones that were transmuted into
flesh.
that year the rain rained so much that memory was rendered
meaningless. throats were clogged with sludge and the brows that the aged held in their hands fused with their fingers,
and their arms fused to their legs and their graceful gestures smelt their bodies and the youngest children ended up glued to their mothers’ breasts.
only our mouths dared to remain open and when the rain
finally stopped, huge black birds flew from them and disappeared into the distance. and the drought came back and the world dried out. now the ancient flesh has turned to dirt,
the fossils to stone and the branches to humus.

"o sentimento dum ocidental

ave-marias
nas nossas ruas, ao anoitecer,
há tal soturnidade, há tal melancolia,
que as sombras, o bulício, o tejo, a maresia
despertam-me um desejo absurdo de sofrer.
o céu parece baixo e de neblina,
o gás extravasado enjoa-me, perturba;
e os edifícios, com as chaminés, e a turba
toldam-se duma cor monótona e londrina.
batem carros de aluguer, ao fundo,
levando à via-férrea os que se vão. felizes!
ocorrem-me em revista exposições, países:
madrid, paris, berlim, s. petersburgo, o mundo!
semelham-se a gaiolas, com viveiros,
as edificações somente emadeiradas:
como morcegos, ao cair das badaladas,
saltam de viga em viga os mestres carpinteiros.
voltam os calafates, aos magotes,
de jaquetão ao ombro, enfarruscados, secos;
embrenho-me, a cismar, por boqueirões, por becos,
ou erro pelos cais a que se atracam botes.
e evoco, então, as crónicas navais:
mouros, baixéis, heróis, tudo ressuscitado!
luta camões no sul, salvando um livro a nado!
singram soberbas naus que eu não verei jamais!
e o fim da tarde inspira-me; e incomoda!
de um couraçado inglês vogam os escaleres;
e em terra num tinir de louças e talheres
flamejam, ao jantar alguns hotéis da moda.
num trem de praça arengam dois dentistas;
um trôpego arlequim braceja numas andas;
os querubins do lar flutuam nas varandas;
às portas, em cabelo, enfadam-se os lojistas!
vazam-se os arsenais e as oficinas;
reluz, viscoso, o rio, apressam-se as obreiras;
e num cardume negro, hercúleas, galhofeiras,
correndo com firmeza, assomam as varinas.
vêm sacudindo as ancas opulentas!
seus troncos varonis recordam-me pilastras;
e algumas, à cabeça, embalam nas canastras
os filhos que depois naufragam nas tormentas.
descalças! nas descargas de carvão,
desde manhã à noite, a bordo das fragatas;
e apinham-se num bairro aonde miam gatas,
e o peixe podre gera os focos de infecção!
ii
noite fechada
toca-se às grades, nas cadeias. som
que mortifica e deixa umas loucuras mansas!
o aljube, em que hoje estão velhinhas e crianças,
bem raramente encerra uma mulher de “dom”!
e eu desconfio, até, de um aneurisma
tão mórbido me sinto, ao acender das luzes;
à vista das prisões, da velha sé, das cruzes,
chora-me o coração que se enche e que se abisma.
a espaços, iluminam-se os andares,
e as tascas, os cafés, as tendas, os estancos
alastram em lençol os seus reflexos brancos;
e a lua lembra o circo e os jogos malabares.
duas igrejas, num saudoso largo,
lançam a nódoa negra e fúnebre do clero:
nelas esfumo um ermo inquisidor severo,
assim que pela história eu me aventuro e alargo.
na parte que abateu no terremoto,
muram-me as construções rectas, iguais, crescidas;
afrontam-me, no resto, as íngremes subidas,
e os sinos dum tanger monástico e devoto.
mas, num recinto público e vulgar,
com bancos de namoro e exíguas pimenteiras,
brônzeo, monumental, de proporções guerreiras,
um épico doutrora ascende, num pilar!
e eu sonho o cólera, imagino a febre,
nesta acumulação de corpos enfezados;
sombrios e espectrais recolhem os soldados;
inflama-se um palácio em face de um casebre.
partem patrulhas de cavalaria
dos arcos dos quartéis que foram já conventos;
idade média! a pé, outras, a passos lentos,
derramam-se por toda a capital, que esfria.
triste cidade! eu temo que me avives
uma paixão defunta! aos lampiões distantes,
enlutam-me, alvejando, as tuas elegantes,
curvadas a sorrir às montras dos ourives.
e mais: as costureiras, as floristas
descem dos magasins, causam-me sobressaltos;
custa-lhes a elevar os seus pescoços altos
e muitas delas são comparsas ou coristas.
e eu, de luneta de uma lente só,
eu acho sempre assunto a quadros revoltados:
entro na brasserie; às mesas de emigrados,
ao riso e à crua luz joga-se o dominó.

ao gás
e saio. a noite pesa, esmaga. nos
passeios de lajedo arrastam-se as impuras.
ó moles hospitais! sai das embocaduras
um sopro que arripia os ombros quase nus.
cercam-me as lojas, tépidas. eu penso
ver círios laterais, ver filas de capelas,
com santos e fiéis, andores, ramos, velas,
em uma catedral de um comprimento imenso.
as burguesinhas do catolicismo
resvalam pelo chão minado pelos canos;
e lembram-me, ao chorar doente dos pianos,
as freiras que os jejuns matavam de histerismo.
num cutileiro, de avental, ao torno,
um forjador maneja um malho, rubramente;
e de uma padaria exala-se, inda quente,
um cheiro salutar e honesto a pão no forno.
e eu que medito um livro que exacerbe,
quisera que o real e a análise mo dessem;
casas de confecções e modas resplandecem;
pelas vitrines olha um ratoneiro imberbe.
longas descidas! não poder pintar
com versos magistrais, salubres e sinceros,
a esguia difusão dos vossos reverberos,
e a vossa palidez romântica e lunar!
que grande cobra, a lúbrica pessoa,
que espartilhada escolhe uns xales com debuxo!
sua excelência atrai, magnética, entre luxo,
que ao longo dos balcões de mogno se amontoa.
e aquela velha, de bandós! por vezes,
a sua traîne imita um leque antigo, aberto,
nas barras verticais, a duas tintas. perto,
escarvam, à vitória, os seus mecklemburgueses.
desdobram-se tecidos estrangeiros;
plantas ornamentais secam nos mostradores;
flocos de pós de arroz pairam sufocadores,
e em nuvens de cetins requebram-se os caixeiros.
mas tudo cansa! apagam-se nas frentes
os candelabros, como estrelas, pouco a pouco;
da solidão regouga um cauteleiro rouco;
tornam-se mausoléus as armações fulgentes.
“dó da miséria!... compaixão de mim!...”
e, nas esquinas, calvo, eterno, sem repouso,
pede-me esmola um homenzinho idoso,
meu velho professor nas aulas de latim!

horas mortas
o tecto fundo de oxigénio, de ar,
estende-se ao comprido, ao meio das trapeiras;
vêm lágrimas de luz dos astros com olheiras,
enleva-me a quimera azul de transmigrar.
por baixo, que portões! que arruamentos!
um parafuso cai nas lajes, às escuras:
colocam-se taipais, rangem as fechaduras,
e os olhos dum caleche espantam-me, sangrentos.
e eu sigo, como as linhas de uma pauta
a dupla correnteza augusta das fachadas;
pois sobem, no silêncio, infaustas e trinadas,
as notas pastoris de uma longínqua flauta.
se eu não morresse, nunca! e eternamente
buscasse e conseguisse a perfeição das cousas!
esqueço-me a prever castíssimas esposas,
que aninhem em mansões de vidro transparente!
ó nossos filhos! que de sonhos ágeis,
pousando, vos trarão a nitidez às vidas!
eu quero as vossas mães e irmãs estremecidas,
numas habitações translúcidas e frágeis.
ah! como a raça ruiva do porvir,
e as frotas dos avós, e os nómadas ardentes,
nós vamos explorar todos os continentes
e pelas vastidões aquáticas seguir!
mas se vivemos, os emparedados,
sem árvores, no vale escuro das muralhas!...
julgo avistar, na treva, as folhas das navalhas
e os gritos de socorro ouvir estrangulados.
e nestes nebulosos corredores
nauseiam-me, surgindo, os ventres das tabernas;
na volta, com saudade, e aos bordos sobre as pernas,
cantam, de braço dado, uns tristes bebedores.
eu não receio, todavia, os roubos;
afastam-se, a distância, os dúbios caminhantes;
e sujos, sem ladrar, ósseos, febris, errantes,
amareladamente, os cães parecem lobos.
e os guardas, que revistam as escadas,
caminham de lanterna e servem de chaveiros;
por cima, as imorais, nos seus roupões ligeiros,
tossem, fumando sobre a pedra das sacadas.

de prédios sepulcrais, com dimensões de montes,

vespers
when evening falls across our streets
and sullen melancholy fills the air,
the tagus, the tang, the shadows and bustle
bring me an absurd desire to suffer.
the sky hangs low and seems all hazy;
the gas from the streetlamps makes me queasy;
the tumult of buildings, chimneys and people
is cloaked in a dullish, londonish hue.
oh lucky travellers in hired coaches
now hieing to the railway station! countries
and exhibitions file past me: madrid,
paris, berlin, st petersburg, the world!
the timber frames of future buildings
resemble cages for keeping animals;
like swooping bats the carpenters leap
from beam to beam at the sound of the bell.
clusters of callous, tar-smeared caulkers
return from the slipways, coats on their shoulders;
i wander through alleys that lead to the river
or walk by the wharves where boats are docked.
i evoke the ocean chronicles: the moors,
old vessels and heroes – all resurrected!
shipwrecked camões swims his book to shore! (1)
great carracks that i’ll never see ride the waves!
the twilight inspires, and also disturbs me!
an english battleship launches its cutters
while swank hotels on land bedazzle
with china and flatware clinking at dinner.
two dentists argue inside a streetcar;
a clumsy clown is struggling on stilts;
children flit, like cherubs, on balconies;
hatless, bored shopkeepers wait at their doors!
the shipyards and workshops are emptying out;
the river glints thickly, the workwomen hurry;
and a black school of herculean fishwives
bursts out of nowhere, joking, laughing.
wagging sumptuous hips they come!
their manly torsos remind me of pillars;
and some, in the baskets on their heads,
rock sons who’ll one day drown in storms.
on frigates – barefoot! – they unload coal (2)
from dawn to dusk, then crowd together
in a neighbourhood where cats meow
and the rotting fish breed infection!
ii
after dark
prisoners bang on the bars of their cells –
a sound that rattles my nerves with shame!
the aljube jail, for old women and children,
rarely encloses a titled lady!
i feel so ill as the lights come on
i worry i might have an aneurysm;
the sight of the jails, crosses, cathedral,
fills and sinks my heart with tears.
one floor after another lights up,
and cafés, restaurants, tobacco and other shops
spread like a sheet their white reflections.
the moon brings jugglers, the circus, to mind.
on an ancient square two churches raise
the clergy’s black, funereal spectre;
i sketch there a lonely, dour inquisitor,
daring to extend myself into history.
in quarters which the earthquake flattened
equal, straight buildings wall me in; (3)
everywhere else i face steep streets
and the tolling of pious, monastic bells.
but gracing a common, public square
with lovers’ benches and lithe pepper trees
a war-sized monument cast in bronze
stands, on a pillar, for an epic that was! (4)
and in this assemblage of stunted bodies
i think of the fever, imagine the cholera;
returning soldiers look sombre as ghosts;
a gleaming palace stands opposite a hovel.
mounted patrolmen set out from the archways
of army barracks that once were convents;
the middle ages! others, on foot,
range through the capital, now turning cold.
sad town! i dread you’ll arouse a dead passion
in me! i mourn upon seeing your elegant
ladies so white in the lamp-lit distance,
leaning and smiling at jewellers’ windows.
coming down from the department stores,
the florists and dressmakers wrench my gut;
they’re hardly able to hold up their heads,
and many are walk-ons and chorus girls.
even in sordid human tableaus
i, with my pince-nez, find subject matter:
i enter the beerhouse; at the immigrants’ tables,
harshly lit, they laugh and play dominoes.
iii
by gaslight
and i go back out. the night’s weight crushes.
impure women roam the sidewalks.
o languid hospitals! ill-clad shoulders
shiver from drafts where streets open up.
warm shops surround me. i think i’m seeing
flanking candles, rows of chapels
with saints and the faithful, flowers, more candles,
more saints, in a vastly long cathedral.
the bourgeois women of catholicism
slip on the ground that’s tunnelled by drainpipes.
to me they recall, with their whining pianos,
the nuns who, fasting, died of madness.
an aproned knife maker, working the lathe,
redhotly wields his blacksmith’s hammer;
and bread, still warm, from the baker’s oven
sends forth its honest, wholesome smell.
and i, whose goal is a book that galls,
want it to show and examine what’s real.
boutiques shine with the latest fashions;
a street urchin gapes at their window displays.
o long descents! could i but paint
with skilled, sincere, salubrious verses
the delicate shimmering of your streetlamps
and all your romantic moonlit pallor!
that sensual, corseted creature selecting
printed shawls – she moves like a snake!
her excellence is a magnet amidst
the finery piled on mahogany counters.
and that old dame with coiled plaits!
her train with its vertical, two-tone stripes
mocks a spread fan! her mecklenburg horses
wait with the carriage, pawing the pavement.
decorative plants wilt on the tables
where clerks unroll their foreign fabrics;
in clouds of satins they bow and smile;
rice powder hovers and chokes the air.
but all grows weary! slowly, like stars,
the storefronts’ hanging lights go dim;
the glittering buildings become mausoleums;
a lone, hoarse voice hawks lottery tickets.
and there on a corner: “please, sir! take pity!”
whenever i pass him, that little old man,
bald and eternal, begs for alms:
the teacher at school who taught me latin!
iv
the dead hours
the lofty ceiling of air, of oxygen,
runs between the facing rooftops;
the stars’ tired eyes shed tears of light;
blue dreams of transmigration exalt me.
below all that, what portals! what streets!
i hear, in the dark, a screw hit the ground,
the clacking of shutters, the jangle of locks;
and the bloodshot eyes of a buggy scare me.
i follow, like lines on a music stave,
the stately double row of façades
while pastoral notes from a distant flute
trill, in the silence, a gloomy warning.
oh, if i’d never die! if forever
i’d seek and attain the perfection of things!
i lose myself envisioning wives
who chastely nest in clear-glass mansions!
dear sons! what swift dreams, alighting,
will bring sharp clarity to your lives!
i want the mothers and sisters you love
to live in luminous, fragile homes.
ah! like our grandfathers’ fleets, like fervent
nomads, like the ruddy race to come, (5)
we’ll go and explore every continent
and sail across the watery expanses!
but how, if we live enclosed by stone
in a dark and treeless valley of walls?
i think i see knives flash in the shadows
and hear a strangled cry for help.
and along these murky corridors
the taverns, if i peer in, appall me.
some sorry drunks are staggering home
and sing, arms joined, for old time’s sake.
but i’m not afraid of being robbed;
the dubious characters fall behind me.
the scrawny and mangy dogs don’t bark;
they look a little like yellowish wolves.
and those keepers of keys, the night watchmen,
scan with their lanterns each entryway;
above them loose women, in scanty robes,
smoke and cough at the balcony windows.

in our streets, at nightfall,
there is such gloom, there is such melancholy,
that the shadows, the hustle and bustle, the tejo river, the sea breeze
awaken in me an absurd desire to suffer.
the sky seems low and misty,
the escaped gas nauseates me, disturbs me;
and the buildings, with their chimneys, and the crowd
are covered in a monotonous and londonish color.
rental cars honk in the distance,
taking those who leave to the railway. happy!
exhibitions, countries come to my mind:
madrid, paris, berlin, st. petersburg, the world!
the buildings, made only of wood,
resemble cages with aviaries:
like bats, at the tolling of the bells,
the master carpenters jump from beam to beam.
the caulkers return in groups,
with their jackets on their shoulders, sooty and dry;
lost in thought, I wander through alleyways and lanes,
or I wander through the docks where boats dock.
and then I evoke nautical chronicles:
moors, galleys, heroes, all resurrected!
camões fights in the south, saving a book by swimming!
proud ships sail that I will never see!
and the end of the afternoon inspires me; and disturbs me!
from a british battleship, rowboats sail;
and on land, in a clinking of dishes and cutlery,
some trendy hotels glow at dinner.
in a cab, two dentists argue;
a limping harlequin flails on stilts;
the cherubs of the home float on the balconies;
at the doorways, shopkeepers grow weary in their hair!
the arsenals and workshops empty out;
the river glistens, viscous, the workers hurry;
and in a black school, herculean and playful,
the fishwives, running firmly, appear.
they shake their opulent hips!
their manly trunks remind me of pillars;
and some, balancing baskets on their heads,
carry children who later perish in storms.
barefoot! unloading coal,
from morning to night, aboard the frigates;
they crowd in a neighborhood where cats meow,
and rotten fish breeds infection!
ii
closed night
knocking on bars in the prisons. a sound
that torments and leaves some gentle madness!
the prison, where today old women and children are,
rarely holds a woman of ""dom""!
and I even suspect an aneurysm
so morbidly I feel, at the lighting of the lights;
at the sight of prisons, the old cathedral, the crosses,
my heart weeps, filling and sinking.
at intervals, the floors light up,
and the taverns, cafes, shops, tobacco shops
spread their white reflections like a sheet;
and the moon reminds me of the circus and juggling games.
two churches, in a nostalgic square,
cast the black and funereal stain of the clergy:
in them, a severe inquisitorial hermit smokes,
as soon as I venture into and expand on history.
in the part that collapsed in the earthquake,
straight, equal, tall buildings wall me in;
the steep climbs confront me in the rest,
and the bells of a monastic and devout tolling.
but in a public and ordinary square,
with benches for courting and small pepper trees,
bronze, monumental, of warlike proportions,
an epic figure once ascends on a pillar!
and I dream of cholera, I imagine fever,
in this accumulation of emaciated bodies;
shadowy and spectral, soldiers gather;
a palace ignites in front of a hovel.
cavalry patrols depart
from the arches of the former barracks turned convents;
middle ages! some on foot, others at a slow pace,
spread throughout the cooling capital.
sad city! I fear that you will rekindle
a dead passion in me! the distant streetlights,
grieving, illuminating, your elegant ones,
bent over, smiling at the jewelers' windows.
and more: seamstresses, florists
descend from the department stores, startling me;
they struggle to lift their high necks
and many of them are actresses or chorus girls.
and I, with a single-lens opera glass,
always find subjects for rebellious paintings:
I enter the brasserie; at the tables of emigrants,
dominoes are played amid laughter and harsh light.
iii
by gaslight
and I go out. the night is heavy, oppressive. on
the stone sidewalks the impure ones drag themselves.
oh soft hospitals! from the doorways
a breath that sends shivers down almost bare shoulders.
the shops surround me, warm. I think
I see side altars, rows of chapels,
with saints and faithful, floats, branches, candles,
in a cathedral of immense length.
the bourgeois girls of catholicism
slide on the floor mined by the pipes;
and they remind me, as they cry sickly to the sound of pianos,
of the nuns who died of hysteria from fasting.
in a cutlery shop, a blacksmith, wearing an apron, works the hammer, with a red glow;
and from a bakery, still warm,
a healthy and honest smell of bread wafts out.
and while I contemplate a book that may exacerbate,
I wish reality and analysis would give it to me;
houses of fashion and trends shine;
a young pickpocket looks through the shop windows.
long descents! not being able to paint
with masterful, healthy and sincere verses,
the slender diffusion of your reflections,
and your romantic and lunar pallor!
what a great snake, the lustful person,
choosing shawls with elaborate patterns, restrained;
their excellence attracts, magnetic, among luxury,
that piles up along the mahogany counters.
and that old woman, with her hair in bandeaus! sometimes,
her train mimics an ancient open fan,
with two-tone vertical bars. nearby,
her mecklenburgers scratch victoriously.
foreign fabrics are unfolded;
ornamental plants dry on the shelves;
powder flakes of rice flutter suffocatingly,
and in clouds of satin the shop assistants sway.
but everything tires! the candelabras are extinguished on the street fronts,
like stars, little by little;
a hoarse street hawker chirps in the solitude;
the dazzling frames become mausoleums.
""pity for misery!... compassion for me!...""
and on the corners, bald, eternal, restless,
an old man, my latin teacher in the school days,
asks me for alms!

dead hours
the deep ceiling of oxygen, of air,
stretches lengthwise, in the middle of the attics;
tears of light from the stars with dark circles come;
I am enraptured by the blue chimera of transmigration.
below, what gates! what streets!
a screw falls on the stones, in the darkness:
fences are put up, locks creak,
and the eyes of a carriage driver startle me, bloodshot.
and I follow, like the lines of a musical staff,
the double august flow of the facades;

esfoladas surgiam suspensas em metálicos ganchos. penas e plumas encharcadas
pejavam o chão. uma ave decapitada abraçava o mundo. em certos pontos do perímetro
estreitos canais expulsavam o sangue para um sítio que me pareceu distante, tão distante

perimeter calling for truth and commerce. the plump, flayed meats lightly swayed,
