"carta ao pai
agora que o senhor
mais assemelha pedaço
de carne com dois olhos
dirigidos ao teto escuro
no leito em que provável
só não há-de morrer só
porque nem a própria
saliva poderá engolir
por si na companhia
somente desta sonda
que o alimenta
me pergunto se ainda
em validade a proibição
da mãe em confessar
ao senhor os hábitos
amorosos das mucosas
que são minhas
e se deveras me amaria
tanto menos soubesse
quanta fricção já tiveram
que não lhes cabia
biológica ou religiosa
-mente e se também
pediria para sua filhoa
a morte que desejou
a tantos de minha laia
quando surgiam na tela
da glboo da record
da manchete do sbt
que sempre constituíram
seu cordão umbilical
com a tradição
e se deveras faria
sobrevir a eles
grande destruição
pela violência
com que urrava
seus xingamentos
típicos de macho
nascido no interior
desse pais de machos
interiores e quebrados
em seus orgulhos falhos
de crer que o pai
é o que abarrota
geladeiras e não deixa
que falte à mesa
o alimento que nutre
as mesmas mucosas
em que corre
o seu sangre
mas não seu deus
e ora neste leito partido
o cérebro em veias
como riachos insistentes
em correr
fora das margens
se o senhor
soubesse o dolo
com que manchei
a mesa
de todos os patriarcas
ainda pergunto-me
se me receberia
com a mansidão
que aceita na testa
o beijo desta sua filhoa
que nada mais é
que a sua imagem
e semelhança invertidas
tal espelho
que refletisse opostos
de gênero e religião
ou o desenho
animado na infância
de uma sala de justiça
onde numa tela
podia-se observar
um mundo ao avesso
e se o pai e o pai
odeiam deveras
o gerado nas normas
da biologia e religião
mais tarde porém geridos
na transgressão das leis
que o pai e o pai
impõem-nos na ciência
de sermos todos falhos
nessa terra onde procriar
é tão frequente
que gere prazer
nenhum e olho
o senhor
com essas pupilas
que talvez jamais
reflitam o pai
mas ora veem o pai
eu
mesmo pedaço
de carne
com dois olhos
peço perdão
em silêncio
pois sequer posso
dizer que não
mais há tempo
e mesmo assim
e porém
e no entanto
e contudo
pelo medo adversativo
de talvez abalar
uma sistema rudimentar
de alicerces
sob a casa

uma vez mais
o silêncio","letter to the father
now that my lord
more closely resembles a hunk
of meat with two eyes
turned toward the dark ceiling
from the gurney where likely
you will not die alone
only because not even able
to swallow your saliva
yourself in the company
of this tube alone
that feeds you
i ask myself
if mother's ban
against confessing
to my lord the amorous habits
of my mucous membranes
is still in place
and if indeed you would love me
the less you knew about
how much rubbing they'd already had
that did not befit them
biological or religious
-ly and also if
you would want for your boyess
the death you wished
on so many of my kind
when they appeared on screen
on globo record
manchete or sbt
which always constituted
your umbilical connection
to tradition
and if indeed you would
make come upon them
great destruction
by the violence
of your raging slurs
typical of a macho man
born in a remote town
in this country of machos
remote and broken
in their false pride
believing that a father
is he who crams
refrigerators full and does
not let the table want for
food to nourish
the same mucous membranes
in which your blood
but not your god
runs thick
and now in this broken gurney
your brain all veins
like rivulets bent on
running
outside the lines
if my lord
knew how
i'd stained the patriarchs'
table with deceit
i still ask myself
if you would welcome
me as meekly
as you accept a kiss
on the forehead from
your boyess
who is nothing more
than your own image
and likeness inverted
a mirror such
as reflects opposites
of gender and religion
or the cartoon
from my childhood
of a hall of justice
where on a screen
you could watch a world gone wrong
and if the father and father
indeed scorn
one created by the norms
of biology and religion
yet later corrected
after flaunting the laws
the father and the father
impose on us in the science
of being all of us flawed
on this earth where procreating
is so common
it brings pleasure
not at all and i look at
my lord
with these pupils
that maybe never
reflect the father
but now see the father
i
also a hunk
of meat
with two eyes
ask forgiveness
in silence
for at least i can
say there is no more time

for conflicted fear
of possibly shaking
a rudimentary system
of foundation
holding up this house

now that you
resemble more a piece
of flesh with two eyes
staring at the dark ceiling
in the bed where likely
you won't die alone
because not even

only of this tube
that feeds you

valid the mother's prohibition
to confess to you
my intimate habits
of mucous membranes
which are mine
and if you would truly love me
less if you knew
how much friction they have had
beyond what was biologically
or religiously appropriate

wish for your child
the death that you wished
for so many of my kind

due to the violence
with which you shouted
your typical male insults
born in the countryside
of this land of internal
and broken males
in their flawed pride

is the one who fills
the fridge and ensures
the table never lacks
the nourishment that feeds
the same mucous membranes
where your blood flows
but not your god
and now in this broken bed
the brain in veins
like persistent streams
running
outside the banks
if you
knew the pain
with which I stained
the table
of all patriarchs
I still wonder
if you would receive me
with the gentleness
that accepts on the forehead
the kiss of your daughter
who is nothing more
than your image
and inverted likeness
like a mirror
reflecting opposite
genders and religions
or the animated drawing
from childhood
of a courtroom
where on a screen
one could see
an upside-down world

truly hate

não há lugares, nunca houve, nem mesmo antigos.
há o que olhamos neles, a sua marca de pó de tijolo que os faz sumir.
só assim conseguimos chegar. só brandamente, para lembrarmos.
não para tocar as colunas liláses ou fazer a travessia no veleiro das tangerinas.

"a viagem de alexandre à índia
andaste de um ao outro lado da terra na vida interminável,
tiveste degredos, piedosos cíumes, a fé desvanescida,
amantes paradas na lavoura, roubando-te o rosto amado.
viste vestígios de que foste a sombra de ninguém,
olhos sem pudor, do reflexo dos ferros no tropel,
franjas do domínio pueril de alexandre, olhando gaugamela.
partiste num porto de transição para o levante,
com vazios para trás, todo o tempo a poder ver,
e ao primeiro inverno, pelos cardeais das suas cinzas,
começaste a travessia que não termina, a história que não acaba.
soubeste porque se vislumbra, em lágrimas, o pinheiro da juventude,
o nome quebrado num turvo ar medido sem corda,
e a maresia do vento de feição no segundo inverno.
em troca perseguiste o que rege o homem fortuito,
segredando em palácios de mármore que são apenas pedras,
dos fracassos a que jamais alguém ajoelhara.
ao terceiro inverno descobriste o hemisfério, e ao quarto,
sem ideia de guerra ou ordem para mudar o reino,
escolheste adornar os aquedutos sob o manto dos regatos,
sentado, na brisa no tanque, ao febril entardecer.
de quem te aproximaste, no seu trajecto interminado,
sem lugar senão o que esfria na mente recortada,
naquilo que se ramifica, tornando-se na própria teia,
contigo propagou o dever de passar em toda a parte.
e quando veio o quinto inverno, e o sexto, suturaste o sangue,
trouxeste a pele à curva dos rios, acolheste o que de resto se desmorona,
e pudeste enfim, na crença dos migradores furtivos, entender que
tudo se perde noutro lugar ainda, e após esse ainda noutro
e que ao fim de cada manhã noutra manhã
tudo é incerto, tão conforme o dente-de-leão no meio de searas,
tão emudecido como a veia exausta dos não sepultados.
na mansarda onde vagueia o dia e a noite
o vento responde, cortando o centeio e o calcário, e a vela
que brilha na luz de estrelas veladas, já desaparecidas,
pisadas, mudas, engolidas aos pés do sétimo inverno,
arpoa o coração e a ruína — os meridianos despem-se, voam
em vinte e cinco anos que há pouco se beijavam, e seja dito ou não dito
o prazer que inflige um pico de tormentos
por lábios que só as mulheres conhecem
no moinho das águas da morte em varanasi,
sacode a chama de quanto vale, dura e canta
o princípio e o fim do teu poder na terra.","alexandres`s travel to india
you wandered an interminable life across the earth,
suffered exile, piteous jealousy, futile faith,
labour-arrested lovers plundering your beloved’s face.
you saw traces of having been no one’s shadow,
impudent eyes, the reflection of iron on the rampage,
hints of alexander’s puerile dominance, contemplating gaugamela.
you set off from a transient port towards the levant,
leaving emptiness behind, seeing all of time,
and in the first winter, by the cardinals of its ashes,
you started the endless crossing, the incessant history.
you knew, because the pine tree of youth can be glimpsed through tears,
of the shattered name in a cloudy mood measured without ropes,
and of the favourable sea breeze in the second winter.
in exchange you pursued that which rules the fortuitous man,
whispering in marble palaces that are but stones,
failures to which no one had ever knelt.
by the third winter you discovered the hemisphere, and by the fourth,
non intent on war or order to change the kingdom,
you chose to adorn aqueducts with the mantle of streams,
sitting by the pool breeze, in the evening´s lingering fever.
whomever you approached, in their indefinite path,
without a place except that which fades inside a patchy mind,
in that which branches out and becomes the very web,
has spread with you the duty to pass through everywhere.
and by the fifth winter, and the sixth, you stitched up the blood,
brought the skin on to the river bends, welcomed that which falls apart,
and were at last capable, with the belief of a stealthy migrant, of understanding
that all is lost yet in another place, and after this in yet another
and that by the end of each morning in another morning
all is uncertain, just like a dandelion in a field of wheat,
as muted as the exhausted vein of the unburied.
in the attic where night and day roam
the wind replies, cutting the chalk and the rye, and the candle,
shimmering in the light of the veiled stars already gone,
trodden, voiceless, swallowed up by the seventh winter,
spears the heart and the ruin — the meridians undress, fly away
in twenty five years that were just kissing yesterday, and be it told or untold
the pleasure that brings a peak of torment, inflicted
by lips that only women know
in the turmoil of varanasi´s death waters,
tests the flame of the merit, endurance and song of
the beginning and the end of your power on earth.",pt_XX,en_XX,"Alexander's journey to India
You walked from one side of the earth to the other in endless life,
You had exiles, pious jealousies, faith faded,
lovers stopped in the fields, stealing your beloved face.
You saw traces that you were the shadow of no one,
eyes shameless, the reflection of irons in the tumult,
fringes of Alexander's childish dominion, watching Gaugamela.
You left in a port of transition to the uprising,
with emptiness behind, all the time able to see,
and at the first winter, through the cardinals of its ashes,
you began the crossing that never ends, the story that never ends.
You knew why the pine of youth is glimpsed in tears,
the name broken in a murky air measured without a cord,
and the sea breeze of the wind in the second winter.
In return, you pursued what governs the fortuitous man,
whispering in marble palaces that are only stones,
of failures to which no one had ever knelt.
In the third winter you discovered the hemisphere, and in the fourth,
without idea of war or order to change the kingdom,
you chose to adorn the aqueducts under the cloak of streams,
sitting, in the breeze by the pond, at the feverish dusk.
Whom you approached, in his endless journey,
with no place but what cools in the cut mind,
in what branches out, becoming the very web,
with you spread the duty to pass everywhere.
And when the fifth winter came, and the sixth, you sutured the blood,
you brought the skin to the curve of the rivers, welcomed what else crumbles,
and you could finally, in the belief of furtive migrants, understand that
everything is lost elsewhere, and after that elsewhere in another
and that at the end of each morning another morning
everything is uncertain, so like the dandelion in the middle of the fields,
so muted like the exhausted vein of the unburied.
In the garret where the day and the night wander
the wind answers, cutting the rye and the limestone, and the candle
shining in the light of veiled stars, already disappeared,
trod on, silent, swallowed at the feet of the seventh winter,
harpoons the heart and the ruin — the meridians undress, fly
in twenty-five years that were recently kissing, and be it said or unsaid
the pleasure that inflicts a peak of torments
by lips that only women know
in the mill of the waters of death in Varanasi,
shakes the flame of how much it is worth, lasts and sings
the beginning and the end of your power on earth.",0

cadeiras de napa cor de laranja
bordavam um balcão quase vazio.

"morticínio ancestral
quando minha avó torcia o pescoço
dos frangos, não raras vezes
chegando a decapitá-los,
e os lançava ao chão frio de cimento
para aquela dança assustadora,
não havia em seu rosto
paixão, prazer, ou pena.
na escuridão escondida dentro do meio-dia,
aqueles morticínios eram os atos
mais honestos na violência
daquela casa e daquela infância.
afogando na água fervente
os cadáveres sem cabeça
[que ficara de banda no quintal
interrogando seu criador],
ela passava a depená-los, ágil,
qual fosse ela um gavião-pedrês.
como o cafuné do crânio da onça
no crânio da capivara,
ou o abraço anelar das garras do carcará
ao redor do corpo todo-torso da cobra,
nada naquela velha
era cogitado
para além da missão simples:
alimentar a prole.
como todo animal que não questiona
a cadeia alimentar diante da fome,
minha avó foi o bicho mais inocente
da minha casa e da minha selva.
mais do que os gatos e pombos,
mais do que os jabutis e coelhos,
com certeza
era mais inocente minha avó
do que as cachorras da casa,

com os dentes afiados — mas inúteis,
esperando também daquela mamífera-anciã
que manchasse ela as mãos de sangue.","ancestral slaughter

the necks of chickens, not infrequently
to the point of decapitation,

on her face there was no trace

in the darkness hidden within the noonday,
those killings were the most honest acts
in the violence of that house,
that childhood.
after plunging into boiling water
those headless corpses
[who’d stood in brood in the yard
questioning their creator],
she began to pluck them, with all
the agility of a gray-lined hawk.
like the caress of the jaguar’s skull
on the capybara’s, or the annulate
embrace of the caracara’s claws
on a snake’s all-torso body,
nothing in that old woman
was cognized
beyond a simple mission:
to feed her offspring.
as any animal does not question
the food chain in the face of hunger,
my grandmother was of all animals
the most innocent in my house
and in my forest.
more than cats and pigeons,
more than tortoises and rabbits,
this is far more certain:

"écloga segunda
dizem que havia um pastor
antre tejo e odiana,
que era perdido de amor
por uma moça joana:
joana patas guardava
pela ribeira do tejo
seu pai acerca morava
e o pastor, de alentejo
era: e jano se chamava
quando as fomes grandes foram
que alentejo foi perdido
da aldeã que chamam torrão
foi este pastor fogido:
levava um pouco de gado
que lhe ficou de outro muito
que lhe morreu de cansado
que alentejo era enxuto
d’água, e mui seco de prado
toda a terra foi perdida
no campo do tejo só
achava o gado guarida
ver alentejo era um dó:
e jano, pera salvar
o gado que lhe ficou,
foi esta terra buscar,
e um cuidado levou,
outro foi ele lá achar
o dia que ali chegou
com seu gado e com seu fato
com tudo se agasalhou
em uma bicada de um mato:
e levando-o a pascer
o outro dia à ribeira
joana acertou de ir ver,
que andava pela ribeira
do tejo: a flores colher
vestido branco trazia
um pouco afrontada andava
fermosa bem parecia
aos olhos de quem na olhava:
jano em vendo-a foi pasmado
mas por ver que ela fazia
escondeu-se antre um prado:
joana flores colhia
jano colhia cuidado
despois que ela teve as flores
já colhidas e escolhidas,
as desvariadas cores
com rosas entremetidas:
fez delas uma capela
e soltou os seus cabelos
que eram tão longos como ela
e de cada um a jano em vê-los
lhe nascia uma querela
e em quanto aquisto fazia
joana: o seu gado andava
por dentro da água fria
todo após quem o guiava:
dum pato grande era guia
e todo junto em carreira
ora rio acima ia,
ora, na mesma maneira
o rio abaixo descia
joana como assentou
a capela: foi com a mão
à cabeça, e atentou
se estava em boa feição:
não ficando satisfeita
do que da mão presumia
partiu-se dali direita
para onde o rio fazia
d’água: uma mansa, colheita
chegando à beira do rio,
as patas logo vieram
todas uma e uma, em fio,
que toda a água moveram:
de quanto ela já folgou
com aquestes gasalhados
tanto entonces lhe pesou
e com pedras e com brados
d’ali longe as enxotou
depois que elas foram idas
e que a água assossegou
joana as abas erguidas
entrar pel’água ordenou,
e assentando-se então
as çapatas descalçou
e pondo-as sobre o chão
por dentro d’água entrou
e a jano polo coração
em quanto com passos quedos
joana pela água ia
antre uns desejos e medos
jano onde estava ardia:
não sabia se falasse
se saísse, se estivesse
que o amor mandava que ousasse
e por que a não perdesse
fazia que arreceasse
dizem que naqueste meo
se esteve joana olhando
e descobrindo o seu seo
olhou-se, e dixe um ai dando:
eu guardo patas coitada
não sei onde isto há de ir ter
mais era eu pera guardada
que concerto foi este ser
fermosa, e mal empregada
em aquisto jano ouvindo
não se pôde em si sofrer
que d’antre as ervas saindo
se não lançasse a correr:
joana quando sentiu
os estrompidos de jano
e que se virou e o viu
temor do presente dano
lhe deu pés com que fugiu
mui perto estava o casal
onde vivia o pai dela
que fez ir mais longe o mal
que jano teve de vê-la:
mas o medo que causou
joana partir-se assi
tanto as mãos lhe embaraçou
que a çapata esquerda ali
com a pressa lhe ficou
jano quando viu, e olhou
que nenhum remédio havia
pera o lugar se tornou
aonde ela n’água se via:
e vendo a çapata estar
no areal, à beira d’água
foi correndo a abraçar
tomando-a cresceu-lhe a mágoa
e começou de chorar
toda a çapata e os peitos
em lagrimas se banharam
muitos foram os respeitos
que tanto choro causaram:
encostado ao seu cajado
a çapata na outra mão
despois de um longo cuidado
de dentro do coração
começou falar cansado

e pera o coração abrolhos:

e hoje per caso estranho
não sei em que hora aqui vim
cobrei cuidado tamanho,
que aos outros todos pôs fim

antes que este mal viesse
que me tantos vai mostrando
que alguns cuidados tivesse
não me matavam cuidando,
agora por meus pecados
e segundo em mi vou vendo
não podem ser outros fados
meus cuidados não entendo
e moiro-me assi de cuidados
dentro de meu pensamento
há tanta contrariedade
que sento contra o que sento
vontade, e contra vontade:
estou em tanto desvairo,
que não me entendo comigo
donde esperarei repairo
que vejo grande o perigo
e muito mor o contrario
quem me trouxe a esta terra
alhea, onde guardada
me estava tamanha guerra
e a esperança levada:
comigo me estou espantado
como em tão pouco me dei
mas cuidando nisto estando,
os olhos com que outrem olhei
de mim, se estavam vingando
e por meu mal ser mor: inda
de mim tenho o agravo mor
que da minha mágoa infinda
eu fui parte e causador,
que se me não alevantara
d’antre as ervas onde estava
mais dos meus olhos gozara
e já que assi se ordenava
isto ao menos me ficara
desastres cuidava eu já,
quando eu ontem aqui cheguei
que a vós e á ventura má,
ambos acabava e errei:

que o meu gado remediado
comigo bem me haveria
e estava-me ordenado

e em dizendo isto parece
trasportou-se no seu mal
e como a quem o ar falece
caiu naquele areal:
grande espaço se passou
que esteve ali sem sentido
e neste meo chegou
um pastor seu conhecido
e que dormia cuidou
franco de sandovir era
o seu nome, e buscava
uma frauta que perdera
que ele mais que a si amava:
este era aquele pastor
a quem celia muito amou
ninfa do maior primor
que em mondego se banhou
e que cantava milhor
e a frauta sua era aquela
que lhe celia dera, quando
o desterraram por ela,
chorando ele, ela chorando:
viera ele ali mora
porque achou aquelas terras
mais conformes ao cuidar
d’ambas partes cercam serras,

doutro tempo conhecidos
estes dous pastores eram
d’estranhas terras nascidos,

tornou franco a lhe notar
como jazia no chão

muito esteve duvidando

indo-se e jano deixando

também pera o acordar
não sabia se acertava
que jano era no lugar
novo, e arreceava
em cabo de o anojar
naquesta dúvida estando

dixe um suspiro dando
ai cuidado, e mais cuidado:
ouvindo-lhe isto dizer
franco se ficou pasmado
e tornando-o milhor ver
de sob seu esquerdo lado
viu-lh’a çapata ter
suspeitou logo o que era,

se houve por certificado

quando viu franco estar
sem fala um pouco ficou

falar-lhe assi começou

em alentejo, e porém
não quisera eu ver-te assi
conta-me que mal foi este
que tão demudado estás
ou que houveste ou perdeste
se há remédio havê-lo-ás:
faz jano então por se erguer
não podendo de cansado
foi-lhe a mão, franco, estender
e a um freixo encostado
lhe começou responder

não me espero de remir

por ver e por romaria,

vestido todo de novo
ao ombro um chapeirão

com um cajado na mão
tomando-me pelo braço

d’ali um grande pedaço
onde milhor sombra achou:

a quem a eu não posso dar
ou jano por ti me desculpa
pois sabes que é dessejar
jano
de cousa que muito queiras
deve essa frauta de ser,
dixe jano, são primeiras,
lhe tornou franco a dizer:
quem te tal dom otorgou,
lhe dixe jano após isto
a muito a ti te obrigou
a la fé grão mestre nisto
deves ser, se o cão não errou
canta, franco, alguma cousa
ama a musica a tristeza
veremos se me repousa
onde a mágoa tem firmeza;
dixe franco certamente
cantarei pola vontade
te fazer como a doente
inda jano que à verdade,
a minha é chorar somente
franco quero-te cantar aquela
que ontem, depois que perdi
a frauta cantei sem ela
à noite quando me vi,
cansado de não na achar
mais muito que de buscá-la
me fui eu ontem lançar
mas jano faço-te fala
que não pude olho cerrar
lá despois da noute mea,
quando tudo se calava
comecei em fala chea,
um moucho me acompanhava:
de longe me parecia
não sei se me enganava eu
que ele a mim não me respondia
com um ai! grande como o meu
mas o canto assi dizia
cantiga
perdido e desterrado
que farei onde me irei
depois de desesperado
outra mor mágoa achei
desconsolado de mim
em terra alhea alongado
onde por remédio vim
e repairo do meu gado:
mas ó mal aventurado
de mim sem consolação
temo que há de ser forçado
pois que fui tão mal fadado
matar-me com minha mão
que conta darei eu agora
a quem não me ha de pedir
que desculpa porei ora
a quem não me há de ouvir:
frauta dom da mais querida
que cobre esta noute escura
frauta minha sois perdida
façam-me uma sepultura
que muito ha que estou sem vida
e ponham na sepultura
letras que digam desta arte
a da alma está em outra parte
se aprouver aos longos anos
e aos tempos que hão de vir
que destes graves meus danos
venha celia parte ouvir:
lá onde triste estiver
se ela consigo apartada
lágrimas ter não puder
será minha alma pagada
ou o que então de mim houver
inda que não queira nada
tudo é menos de passar
que lá os olhos soem levar
fugiram contando os dias,
fizeram-se as noutes sós
pera os tristes como nós
jano esta é a cantiga,
ca a derradeira cri que era
e por sair de fadiga
confesso-te que o quisera:
mas se a lama e entendimento
não morrem com o corpo, a mágoa
me ficará: vamo-nos que sento
que é tempo do gado ir à água
também tem tempo o tromento","second eclogue
between the rivers tagus
and guadiana, there lived,
it’s said, a shepherd lost
in love for one joana.
the maiden kept ducks
along the tagus’s banks,
her father’s house nearby.
the shepherd’s name was jano,
he hailed from alentejo.
when famine swept the land,
laying it all to waste,
the shepherd, seeking refuge,
fled torrão, his village.
he took with him the remnants
of his once-great flock,
the rest dead of exhaustion.
the drought-struck alentejo
was rather poor in pasture.
everywhere was the piteous
sight of barren fields!
only in the tagus’s
meadows could his flock
find relief. and so jano,
to save his dwindling herd,
set out for land to graze on.
the heart he held was troubled,
and trouble was waiting ahead.
the day that he arrived
with goats and sheep in tow,
he pitched camp at the edge
of a wood. the next morning,
while taking his flock to feed
along the river’s margins,
he laid eyes on joana,
out picking the flowers
that lined the tagus’s banks.
the dress she wore was white,
her cheeks were lightly flushed,
to jano, his eyes agog,
she looked fair and lovely.
though smitten at first sight,
he crouched behind the reeds,
admiring her from a distance.
joana gathered flowers,
in jano passion gathered.
after she had collected
her flowers and selected
the various shades, weaving
the blossoms together with roses,
she made a garland, and let
her hair fall: those tresses
were as long as she was tall.
every lock of her hair
was awakening jano’s desire.
as joana tidied her hair,
her flock of hens waddled
into the cool water,
guided by a huge mallard.
they swam, now upriver,
all in one direction,
now swiftly swam downstream,
together in single file.
joana placed the garland
on her head, stroking it
with her hands to see if
all sat perfectly in place.
not quite satisfied
with what her fingers revealed,
straight away she went
to where the river formed
a cove of placid water.
no sooner had she reached
the bank than her ducks came
flocking towards her, one after
the other, splashing wildly.
initially she’d delighted
in these shows of affection,
quickly her heart grew heavy.
flinging rocks and jeers,
she shooed the ducks away.
once they were all gone,
and the water calm again,
joana tucked her skirt up,
preparing for a swim.
she sat upon the bank,
carefully removing her slippers,
placing each on the ground.
then into the water she went,
and deep into jano’s heart.
as joana took delicate
steps into the river,
jano kept utterly still,
ablaze with desire and fear.
whether to speak, run,
stay put — he didn’t know.
love demanded boldness,
and yet the very thought of
losing her stirred up dread.
all this time joana
stood gazing at her reflection.
staring at her bosom,
she gave a sigh and said:
“what torment! a keeper
of ducks, i should be kept.
where is my life going?
what cruel sense of harmony:
to be fair and drudging away!
hearing these words jano
couldn’t contain himself.
having no other choice,
he burst out the grassy bank.
joana, feeling the thunderous
crash of jano’s footsteps,
turned and saw his face.
sensing the danger at hand,
she swiftly ran toward home.
the house where her father lived
was near, which plunged jano
further into the despair
born of their encounter.
the same fear that had urged
joana’s feet forward
also completely seized
her hands — and in her haste
she grabbed only one slipper.
looking around jano
saw there was no remedy,
turning his gaze to where
joana had studied her image.
when he spotted her slipper
on top the pebbly shore,
he raced over to retrieve it.
squeezing it in his arms,
he felt his sorrow grow,
and began to weep, bathing
his chest and the slipper in tears.
many were the reasons
for his anguished weeping.
leaning against his staff,
holding the slipper tightly,
jano paused for a moment
then he spoke from the heart,
exhausted and teary-eyed.
jano
“o remnant of the fairest
thing that i’ve ever seen,
to my eyes you are a rose,
and to my heart, thistles.
slipper cruelly forgotten,
remembering cruel passion,
who left you sweeps me away—
what an unfair exchange!
alas, that’s the way it must be.
“in my twenty-one years
i can’t remember feeling
even a pang of sorrow,
my flock’s troubles aside.
today, by some strange fate,
— i don’t know when exactly—,
i was racked by a yearning
that eclipsed my other cares,
becoming estranged myself.
“before this present sorrow,
which only multiplies,
although i had my cares,
the caring didn’t kill me.
but now it’s far too late,
i sense the change within,
my fate’s already sealed.
i do not grasp my anguish,
and languish of this passion.
“all i think is riddled
with glaring contradictions:
i oppose what i desire,
while desiring the opposite.
what i feel is so muddled,
i’m at odds with myself.
where might i look for relief?
i know the danger is grave—
graver is my confusion.
“who brought me to this strange
land, where an all-out war
awaited me and where i had
my hope taken away?
i scarcely can believe it:
here i am, reduced
to tears, passion’s slave.
the eyes with which i glimpsed
my beloved are taking revenge.
“my sorrow is greater still:
i brought this all on myself,
culprit and victim of infinite
suffering. had i only
stayed hidden in the reeds,
i would have feasted my eyes
on her beauty, and then —
since it has to be this way —,
at least i’d have my memory.
“disaster upon disaster!
yesterday i came here,
thinking my troubles gone.
oh how i was mistaken!
though i’d begun to hope
that, with my flock restored,
some good might come my way,
sadly, fortune willed
that i should suffer on.
“accursed love! who made me
love's prisoner knows none.
my sad, lonely eyes,
having met her gaze
on the banks of this river
that stretches unto infinity,
carrying water to sea:
you’ll be the faithful witnesses
to all my weighty sorrows.
author
having said these words,
transported by his passion,
jano fell on the sand,
like a man starved of air.
after some time had gone by,
jano still lying senseless,
a shepherd he used to know
passed by, noting the man
fast asleep on the ground.
franco of sandovir
was his name—searching
for a flute he had lost
but loved better than life,
this shepherd was adored
by none less than celia,
that finest of nymphs who bathed
in the mondego’s waters,
hers the sweetest of voices.
she gave the flute to franco
when he was leaving for exile
—imposed on him for his love—,
he weeping as she wept.
he had come here to live,
finding the landscape appropriate
for his aching heart:
rugged hills on all sides,
open fields to gaze on.
born to very little
in villages far apart,
these two shepherds had been
friends in bygone days.
for this reason franco
turned to take another
look at the man lying
on the ground, sensing
that something was amiss.
franco struggled greatly
deciding what to do—
were he to leave jano
behind, his heart would ache.
nor did he think it wise
to rouse his friend awake.
with jano being asleep
in an unfamiliar place,
he feared that he might startle.
franco wrestling with doubt,
jano turned on his back.
heaving a sigh, he said,
“all i do is suffer!”
when he heard these words,
franco turned around
in astonishment, noticing
the slipper tucked gingerly
beneath jano’s left arm.
he suspected what it was,
for he too was in love.
in jano’s bitter words
he’d all the proof he needed.
jano, now fully alert,
realizing it was franco,
stared in bewildered silence.
franco greeted him warmly
and with these words began:
franco
“why jano, i had thought
you lived in other parts.
i feared, for you and your flock,
the year might go this way.
when i caught word of the drought
now sweeping alentejo,
i hoped i’d see you here,
though certainly not in this state.
“tell me what harm’s been done
that you should be so changed?
what trouble found? thing lost?
if there’s a cure, you’ll have it.”
when jano, still quite weak,
tried to get up but stumbled,
franco held out his hand.
leaning against the trunk
of an ash tree jano said:
jano
“i came to the fields before me
to give life to my flock.
i slaked one desire only
to know greater thirst.
to my cattle i gave life,
having taken my own!
the prophecy’s been fulfilled,
as revealed by pierio,
when my first beard came in.
author
“among shepherds,” said franco,
“his reputation precedes him.
he considers all his friends;
he’s given, they say, to affairs.
now, jano, tell me this,
if he warned you in advance,
why this present hardship?
i hear he’s an honest friend
to men and women both.”
jano
“franco, i’ve grown so weary,
of the sorrow i’ve found
since coming to this place,
i can feel the strain in my voice.
whatever fortune brings,
a man can’t resist his fate,
what will be, will be—
there’s no escaping it, no point
fighting it, no hiding away.
“but with you, dear franco,
i can freely vent my pain.
knowing you to be a friend,
i wish to tell you everything.
i don’t ask that you provide
comfort or remedy, franco.
fr i can’t hope to be saved
from the trouble i’m in,
at least not till i die.
“it was a saint’s day feast:
all the people huddled
together, pilgrims come
from far and wide to see.
that day i remember dressing
in all new clothes, draped on
my shoulder was a woolen
hood coveted by the crowd.
in my hand i held my staff.
“taking me by the arm,
pierio led me some distance,
to a well-shaded grove.
telling me to take a seat
and sitting down next to me,
he paused and stared a while,
not saying a word, looking
on the verge of tears.
pierio
“jano,” he said, “i see
you don’t lack for worldly goods.
but with each passing year
my outlook grows more grim.
i see a black cloud looming.
now that you’re of age,
i see you stripped of freedom,
in exile far from home,
still farther from your will.
“in a land you’ve yet to see,
you’ll catch sight of something
that fills your heart with sorrow
for the rest of your days.
you’ll die of an affliction
that’s now just a distant threat.
live, therefore, in fear,
for no man knows the hour
when love will choose to strike.
“jano, the things i’ve said
can’t be very far away:
i see the down on your lip;
look at how you’re acting.
you’ll travel to a strange land
so as not to lose your flock,
enduring bitter hardships
for the briefest of pleasures,
so you’ll see, should you choose.”
pierio shook his head,
a stern look on his face.
“now, for your own sake,
act with manly honor,
and etch onto your heart
the words i’m about to say.
some hard days lie ahead,
jano, i must remind you.
may god prove me wrong!”
“in trying to save your flock,
you’ll become lost to yourself—
a loss that’s beyond repair
by the time it registers.
in the fields by the river,
among valleys, there lurks
your suffering’s first cause.
elsewhere you’ll meet your demise:
“her dainty mannerisms,
her wavy blonde hair
will subject your heart and mind
to never-ending punishment.
words laced with disdain,
words uttered in scorn,
a vast array of injuries —
it’ll all make you complain
so bitterly, you’d rather die.”
jano
“nearly all that i’ve said
happened as predicted.
what’s not yet come to pass,
the past has set in motion.
just a short while ago,
i caught sight of a lady
my eyes keep searching for.
my life and soul, she’s gone,
having deemed me unworthy.”
author
while jano spoke, a bloodhound
belonging to franco found
the missing flute, clutching it
with its teeth. when he saw,
bursting with joy, franco
ran to retrieve the flute.
standing on its hind legs,
the dog placed it in his hands,
proceeding to roll on its back.
franco turned to jano,
then he said these words:
“when he sees what he’s pined for,
a man forgets all else.
i cut your story short—
for that you’ll have to blame
whom i can’t, or forgive me
yourself, jano. you know
what it means to be in love.”
“that flute must be dear to you
as few things are,” said jano.
“indeed, nothing’s dearer,”
franco said in response.
“whoever gave you that
must have you in her debt,”
jano said to franco,
“truly you must play well ,
unless the dog got it wrong.”
“sing something, franco,
sadness loves a song!
let us see if your music
can’t soothe my bitter sorrow.”
“of course,” franco said,
“i will sing for you, jano,
as one sings for an ailing man.
although truth be told,
my song is but a wail.”
“i would like for you to hear
the song i sang last night,
after i had lost my flute,
left with only my voice.
when at last i went to bed,
i wasn’t tired of searching,
but weary of finding nothing.
now, jano, i mean it,
i couldn’t shut my eyes.”
“there, in the deep of night,
when all was utterly still,
i belted out my song,
an owl kept me company.
from his faraway perch,
—perhaps i only imagined it—
the owl would respond with sighs
as heavy as my own.
at any rate, here goes.”
song
wandering in exile i ask:
what to do, where to go?
after the deepest despair,
i’ve found the greatest sorrow.
the anguish! i’m a roving
stranger in remote lands,
to which i came in search
of refuge for my flock!
i, to whom cruel fortune
affords no consolation,
fear that, being ill-fated,
i will one day be made
to die by my own hand.
how to explain myself
to one not here to ask me?
how to beg forgiveness
of one who cannot hear me?
o gift of my beloved,
whose absence shrouds the night,
my flute, lost forever!
make a grave and bury me:
i perished long ago…
and upon my tombstone,
let these words be written:
in her heart lies my soul.
if on a distant day
in years to come, celia,
wherever she may be,
having heard the smallest
portion of all i suffered,
were to fall to pieces,
unable to hold back tears—
then would my soul be sated,
or whatever remains of me.
though i ask for nothing,
since i suffer so greatly,
let my eyes drift in reverie.
day after day slips by.
these lonely nights were made
for anguished spirits like ours.
“that’s the song, dear jano,
i believed it was my last;
i confess i hoped it’d mark
the end of all my suffering.
if mind and soul don’t perish
with the body, my sorrow
will remain. let us go,
it’s time the flock grazed,
torment too has its season.”",pt_XX,en_XX,Second,0

é-me indiferente: poeta, poetisa
dependerá do ritmo ou da medida –

sobre chuva e choro. hoje seria
prosa, ou sobre chuva e a pólvora:

com delicado verbo ao coração.
rebenta, murcho músculo entupido –

moldar a boca ao disparo ou regular
a abertura ao diafragma. dependente

depends on the measure, and the stress –
i prefer translator, but admit
that i sometimes can’t be plied, i’m a narcissist.

my earliest poetry was about rain

metade solar outra metade
adentrada na noite que divide e reparte irmãmente os dois
pedaços da mesma ideia:
redonda achatada nos polos insegura no seu tombo
escuridão afora
a cabeça pendular metida entre ombros
sombras
na órbita do absurdo a cumprir a curvatura que lhe cabe
errando distorcendo a silenciosa
nitidez dos hemisférios
enfeitada de gázeos, orifícios, rodeada
de visíveis

muito depois, tortuosos
brincando de se mostrar de se encobrir na açoteia
dos eventos
onde uma língua lambe partículas, intenta locuções
ou a mudez dos vaga-lumes
mas tudo de tudo se afasta

partindo do centro, desalcançando
e o todo se despenhe, móbil

pelo buraco de uma agulha o camelo
do raciocínio
e neva nesta geometria

resplandece muito como se às mãos um lume
viesse entreter as trevas

enterrando os sinais
inclinando a esfera do pensamento para a água

menos nítidas

é no sossego de um quarto extinto rumoroso
que a nossa esfera abate na mole dos seus fantasmas

floco de neve ampliado uma magnólia floresce e floresce

órfãs do disjuntor
frequentam vibrações fabulares exteriores à evidência

half solar the other half
plunged in night that divides and fraternally shares two
scraps of the same idea:
round flattened at the poles insecure in its fall
out of darkness
the pendular head sunk between shoulders
shadows
the orbit of the absurd fulfilling its incumbent curvature
wandering distorting the silent
clarity of hemispheres
festooned in eyes of beryl, orifices, surrounded
by visibilities
panoramas breaking off that linger
long afterwards, coiling
a game of veiling and unveiling on the rooftop terrace
of events
where a tongue licks particles, proffers phrases
or the muteness of fireflies
but everything scatters from everything else
even though we thrust an arm into the void
out from the center, it’s thwarted
and everything crashes, velocious
mobile rewinding, an utter retroversion, and we can see
the camel of reason
pass through the eye of a needle
and it snows in this geometry
such
resplendence really as though a flame were handed to us
to fill the darkness
this is how we are upon the the face of the earth
burning the weeds
burying the signs
tipping the sphere of thinking into the water
each year we go down a series of narrow paths
ever dimmer
inundated, sleep is submerged under nocturnal weight
the body shudders with anonymity
it’s in the calm of a room humming with death
that our sphere falls into its crowd of ghosts
the ceiling opens on the celestial fire
on a different, a singular clarity
and in this emptiness, this opening, in this
high burgeoning snowflake a magnolia blooms and blooms
the immense sequoia of the world retires
to its dominion
while dimensions of fear and crap cool in their own venue
the naked bulb in the middle of the ceiling
the orphan waves of the circuit breaker are hushed
in hidden complexities
attend to fable-like vibrations beyond evidence

sempre estive à sua espera.
quando menino, li recordações da casa dos mortos
e vi a neve caindo na estepe siberiana
e no casaco roto de fédor dostoievski.

nem afasta o céu das aflições da terra.
une o que está separado:
os passos dos homens condenados ao gelo escurecido
e os suspiros de amor que se perdem no ar.

para ouvir a música da neve caindo, algo quase silencioso

são coisas diferentes. basta abrirmos os olhos para ver a neve
cair no campo desolado. e ela cai em nós, a neve branca e fria
que não queima como o fogo do amor.

nem os ouvidos, nem a boca, nem mesmo os nossos corações
que batem na escuridão com o mesmo rumor
da neve caindo nas estepes
e nos telhados das cabanas escuras

o afastam de nós, de nossos braços abertos

it unites what’s separate:
the footsteps of those condemned to darkened ice

or the dying breath of a bird.

falling on a deserted field. and it falls on us, cold white snow
that doesn’t burn like the flame of love.

keep it from us, from our open arms

veria correr sempre a clara fonte,
sem imaginar a água donde nace,
nem quem a luz esconde no horizonte.
tangendo a frauta donde o gado pace,
conheceria as ervas do alto monte;
em deus creria, simples e quieto,
sem mais especular nenhum secreto.
de um certo trasilau se lê e escreve,
entre as cousas da velha antiguidade,
que perdido um grão tempo o siso teve
por causa dũa grande infirmidade;
e enquanto, de si fora, doudo esteve,
tinha por teima e cria por verdade,
que eram suas as naus que navegavam,
quantas no porto píreo ancoravam.
por um senhor mui grande se teria
(além da vida alegre que passava),
pois nas que se perdiam não perdia,
e das que vinham salvas se alegrava.
não tardou muito tempo quando, um dia,
um crito, seu irmão, que ausente estava,
à terra chega; e vendo o irmão perdido,
do fraternal amor foi comovido.
aos médicos o entrega, e com aviso
o faz estar à cura refusada.
triste, que por tornar-lhe o caro siso
lhe tira a doce vida descansada!
as ervas apolíneas, de improviso,
o tornam à saúde atrás passada.
sesudo, trasilau ao caro irmão
agradece a vontade, a obra não.
porque, despois de ver-se no perigo
dos trabalhos que o siso lhe obrigava,
e despois de não ver o estado antigo
que a vã opinião lhe apresentava,
—ó inimigo irmão, com cor d’amigo!
para que me tiraste (suspirava)
da mais quieta vida e livre em tudo
que nunca pôde ter nenhum sesudo?
por que rei, por que duque me trocara?
por que senhor de grande fortaleza?
que me dava que o mundo se acabara,
ou que a ordem mudasse a natureza?
agora é-me pesada a vida cara;
sei que cousa é trabalho e que tristeza.
torna-me a meu estado, que eu te aviso
que na doudice só consiste o siso.","on the world\'s chaos and confusion (excerpt)
happy the man who never places
his small and humble fantasy
in anything greater than simply leading
his cattle to drink from the cold spring
and drawing their milk so that he can drink!
however fortune may stir things up,
he’ll never feel any greater grief
than the weight of knowing his life is brief.
he’ll see the rising sun’s red face
and see the clear spring always flowing,
not wondering where the water comes from
nor who on the horizon hides the light.
playing the flute where his cattle graze,
he’ll know the grass that covers the hill;
in god he’ll simply and calmly believe,
not pondering truths he can’t conceive.
among the things of antiquity,
it’s written of a certain thrasyllus
that, due to a grave infirmity,
he lost his senses for a long season,
during which time, bereft of reason,
he claimed and believed that all the ships
which at the port of piraeus landed
were ships he owned if not commanded.
he took himself for a mighty lord
and enjoyed as well a happy life,
since he lost nothing when ships were lost,
and rejoiced for those that landed safely.
time went by till one day crito
his brother returned after a long absence
and, seeing how thrasyllus had lost his wits,
was moved by fraternal love to pity.
he gave him to doctors, charging them
to perform the cure thus far refused.
alas! by restoring his brother’s senses,
he robbed him of his sweet easy life!
the herbs of apollo, without delay,
gave him back his former health.
now of sound mind, thrasyllus thanked
his brother for caring, not for his act.
for when he saw himself in danger
of the toils that sanity would impose
and saw no more that state of privilege
conferred on him by his fantasy,
he sighed: “o enemy brother, pretended
friend, why did you take from me
that life so calm and free of pains,
which can’t be had by anyone sane?
“what king, or duke or mighty lord
would i have wished to trade places with?
what did i care if the world ended
or if nature’s order suddenly changed?
now dear life is a heavy burden,
for i know what toil and sadness are.
restore me to that state of bliss;
the only sane condition is madness.”",pt_XX,en_XX,"On the Disarray of the World (excerpt)
If someone had such low imagination
To never concern themselves with greater things
But to lead their cattle to the cold spring
And milk them for the milk they would drink!
How blessed they would be!
For, no matter how fortune turned,
They would never feel greater sorrow
Than regretting that life is short.
They would see the sun's purple face rise,
They would see the clear spring always flow,
Without imagining the water's source,
Nor who hides the light on the horizon.
Playing the flute where the cattle graze,
They would know the herbs of the high mountain;
They would believe in God, simple and quiet,
Without speculating on any secrets.
There is a tale of a certain Trasilau,
Among the things of ancient times,
Who lost his mind for a long time
Due to a great illness;
And while he was out of his mind,
He stubbornly believed it to be true,
That the ships that sailed
Were his own, as many as anchored in the Pyrean port.
He would have been a lord very great
(Besides the joyful life he led),
For in those that were lost he lost nothing,
And he rejoiced in those that arrived safely.
Not long after, one day,
A Crito, his brother who had been away,
Returned to land; and seeing his lost brother,
He was moved by fraternal love.
He handed him over to the doctors, and with advice
Made him undergo the refused cure.
Sad, because to restore his dear mind
He took away his peaceful, carefree life!
The Apollonian herbs, suddenly,
Restored him to his former health.
Trasilau, now wise, thanked his dear brother
For the intention, not the action.
Because, after facing the danger
Of the troubles that his mind required,
And after not seeing the old state
That vain opinion presented to him,
""O enemy brother, with a friend's heart!
Why did you take me away?"" he sighed,
""From the most peaceful life, free in all things,
That no wise man could ever have?
Why did you exchange me for a king, for a duke?
For a lord of great strength?
What good did it do me that the world had ended,
Or that order had changed nature?
Now life is burdensome to me;
I know what toil and sorrow are.
Return me to my former state, for I warn you
That wisdom lies only in folly.""",0

like an unconscious nocturnal gaze,
light of extinguished tears, did not feel
the tragic gust, which only
ruffled my heart! O airy wind!
Wind of exaltation and prophecy!
Wind that blows, in waves of mystery,
and so disturbs and enraptures me so much!
Strange wind, in fury, not touching
even the tenderest flower! and thus stirs
my whole being, in flames, emanating
God's light, love's light, infinite light!
Wind that only encounters resistance
in an invisible shadow... a grove,
or rough stone, is like a vague essence;
and to you, I am like a rock.
And in my troubled soul, O crazy wind,
you beat, at night; and a strong murmur
surrounds, drags and carries it, in a moment;
and goes from life to life and death to death.
Wind that took me, I don't know where;
but I know I went; and, beside me, very close,
I saw, face to face, the burning mist that hides
the ghost of God, over the desert!
And I also saw the undefined light
that, in darkness, was made, enlightening
my heart, which flies, beyond life,
losing its burden of tears.
And that great wind overturned
my calm existence; and old pain
pierced my rough and fragile body,
like rain on a beggar's rags.
And I went in a great wind; and I went; and I saw:
I saw God's shadow. And, excited,
I lay down in that shadow, and felt within me
the earth in bloom and the sky all starry.",0

e seguras o colar num gesto extravagante,
defendida de mais uma piada suburbana.
“espera-te o museu”, ia dizer, numa derrisão fatal.
a palavra é recolher sem perda de tempo
e tudo receber com uma última aclamação.
rufam tambores, querida, como nos tempos
antigos, ébrios de sangue, chamando-nos
à cerimónia sacrificial. o rosto que nos promete
o televisor, vê, tem algo de ancestral e terrífico
quando o vemos a meio da fatídica arenga.
mutismo. em casa não temos almofada de joelhos
e a segurança, já o sabemos, é o teu sonho preferido,
se te debruças para os toldos e a linha da água.
vais até à varanda como testemunha ocular dos fogos
que se acendem, inelutavelmente, na distância.

de olhar velado e face muda, inexpressiva,
recolhida, como estás, dentro de ti,
ao esconderijo mais abstruso de todos.

um ruído clamoroso na distância, olhamo-nos,

ou escavar em casa a galeria de mina,
desertando os dois, por um fuso horário,

tomar um revulsivo ou deixarmo-nos ir,
movidos pelo vento, sob a aba dos telhados?
nada poderás levar, num último arrebatamento.

de quando foi desejo teu e perdes sem apelo
sob a lei da plebe ou uma qualquer ordem
pretoriana, sentenciada ao motivo bíblico
e à resignação de uma existência romana.

at home, and if you lean out to the umbrellas along
the shore, we know security is your preferred dream.

das nostalgias. diziam-me:
“ – procura no coro dos mortos o primeiro grau
da felicidade; na obsessão dos pescadores de ostras
um derradeiro uivo de sofrimento . . . ” e as palavras chegavam-me
em tumulto, numa pesada respiração, num estertor
de velho. então, vi o fim: a queda sinuosa dos astros, o rosto
de um gelo azul, o ruído de ondas sobrepondo-se à imagem
do ventre rasgado até às entranhas. nenhum exorcismo me restituiu
a força. entrei na procissão dos sonâmbulos,
juntando a voz ao gemido comum. “ – quem é este?” –
“ – o taciturno poeta, o antigo portador de absolvição.”

nausea from the effervescence of ruins, of the leaves

of nostalgias. i was told:
“seek the first degree of happiness in the chorus
of the dead, a final howl of suffering in the obsessiveness
of oystermen . . . ”, and the words came to me
in a tumult, in heavy breaths, in a death rattle
of the aged. and i saw the end: the spiraling fall of the stars, the face
of a blue ice, the sound of waves drowning out the image

my strength. i entered the procession of the sleepwalkers,
uniting my voice to the common lament. “who is this?”

the discomfort of an effervescence of ruins, of leaves

inhabited by different directions of spirit, heard in the depths of human wells: a tone of voice that multiplies the gasping contradiction

of happiness; in the obsession of oyster fishermen
a final howl of suffering . . . "" and the words came to me
in turmoil, in heavy breathing, in the gasp
of the old. then, I saw the end: the sinuous fall of the stars, the face
of a blue ice, the noise of waves overlaying the image
of the belly torn to the entrails. no exorcism restored me
the strength. I entered the procession of sleepwalkers,
joining my voice to the common moan. "" - who is this?"" -

depressa, sem poente nem crepúsculo: a noite

tocavam a ácida casca. que noite
começou então? não foi, sem dúvida, a noite
áspera do choro e do canto; nem a noite piedosa

a noite única do sonho e da insónia, confundindo-se
no curso sonâmbulo dos corpos que o torpor amante
contamina. noite sem fim – porque
não teve um princípio – e definitiva no olhar

o nome às coisas que nunca o tiveram; e roubando
substância a esses nomes – essa noite
anda pelo meio de mim, entre quem sou
e quem julgo ser, impedindo-me de ver cada um
dos lados em que estou. noite, então,

a chama que não vejo nesse obscuro desejo.","homage to st john of the cross

of weeping and song, nor the compassionate
night that precedes dawn, nor even
that singular night of dream and insomnia, confounded
in the hypnotic conduct of bodies ruled
by love’s torpor. a night without end, since
it had no beginning, definitive in its blind
stare, a reflection without memory that names
what had been nameless, and from the names
takes substance – this night runs
through the middle of me, between who i am
