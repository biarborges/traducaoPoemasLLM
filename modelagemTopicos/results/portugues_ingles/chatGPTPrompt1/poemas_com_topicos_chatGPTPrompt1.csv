soubesse o dolo
com que manchei
a mesa
de todos os patriarcas

se me receberia
com a mansidão
que aceita na testa
o beijo desta sua filhoa
que nada mais é
que a sua imagem
e semelhança invertidas
tal espelho
que refletisse opostos
de gênero e religião
ou o desenho
animado na infância
de uma sala de justiça
onde numa tela
podia-se observar
um mundo ao avesso

odeiam deveras
o gerado nas normas
da biologia e religião

é tão frequente
que gere prazer

de carne
com dois olhos

"a viagem de alexandre à índia
andaste de um ao outro lado da terra na vida interminável,
tiveste degredos, piedosos cíumes, a fé desvanescida,
amantes paradas na lavoura, roubando-te o rosto amado.
viste vestígios de que foste a sombra de ninguém,
olhos sem pudor, do reflexo dos ferros no tropel,
franjas do domínio pueril de alexandre, olhando gaugamela.
partiste num porto de transição para o levante,
com vazios para trás, todo o tempo a poder ver,
e ao primeiro inverno, pelos cardeais das suas cinzas,
começaste a travessia que não termina, a história que não acaba.
soubeste porque se vislumbra, em lágrimas, o pinheiro da juventude,
o nome quebrado num turvo ar medido sem corda,
e a maresia do vento de feição no segundo inverno.
em troca perseguiste o que rege o homem fortuito,
segredando em palácios de mármore que são apenas pedras,
dos fracassos a que jamais alguém ajoelhara.
ao terceiro inverno descobriste o hemisfério, e ao quarto,
sem ideia de guerra ou ordem para mudar o reino,
escolheste adornar os aquedutos sob o manto dos regatos,
sentado, na brisa no tanque, ao febril entardecer.
de quem te aproximaste, no seu trajecto interminado,
sem lugar senão o que esfria na mente recortada,
naquilo que se ramifica, tornando-se na própria teia,
contigo propagou o dever de passar em toda a parte.
e quando veio o quinto inverno, e o sexto, suturaste o sangue,
trouxeste a pele à curva dos rios, acolheste o que de resto se desmorona,
e pudeste enfim, na crença dos migradores furtivos, entender que
tudo se perde noutro lugar ainda, e após esse ainda noutro
e que ao fim de cada manhã noutra manhã
tudo é incerto, tão conforme o dente-de-leão no meio de searas,
tão emudecido como a veia exausta dos não sepultados.
na mansarda onde vagueia o dia e a noite
o vento responde, cortando o centeio e o calcário, e a vela
que brilha na luz de estrelas veladas, já desaparecidas,
pisadas, mudas, engolidas aos pés do sétimo inverno,
arpoa o coração e a ruína — os meridianos despem-se, voam
em vinte e cinco anos que há pouco se beijavam, e seja dito ou não dito
o prazer que inflige um pico de tormentos
por lábios que só as mulheres conhecem
no moinho das águas da morte em varanasi,
sacode a chama de quanto vale, dura e canta
o princípio e o fim do teu poder na terra.","alexandres`s travel to india
you wandered an interminable life across the earth,
suffered exile, piteous jealousy, futile faith,
labour-arrested lovers plundering your beloved’s face.
you saw traces of having been no one’s shadow,
impudent eyes, the reflection of iron on the rampage,
hints of alexander’s puerile dominance, contemplating gaugamela.
you set off from a transient port towards the levant,
leaving emptiness behind, seeing all of time,
and in the first winter, by the cardinals of its ashes,
you started the endless crossing, the incessant history.
you knew, because the pine tree of youth can be glimpsed through tears,
of the shattered name in a cloudy mood measured without ropes,
and of the favourable sea breeze in the second winter.
in exchange you pursued that which rules the fortuitous man,
whispering in marble palaces that are but stones,
failures to which no one had ever knelt.
by the third winter you discovered the hemisphere, and by the fourth,
non intent on war or order to change the kingdom,
you chose to adorn aqueducts with the mantle of streams,
sitting by the pool breeze, in the evening´s lingering fever.
whomever you approached, in their indefinite path,
without a place except that which fades inside a patchy mind,
in that which branches out and becomes the very web,
has spread with you the duty to pass through everywhere.
and by the fifth winter, and the sixth, you stitched up the blood,
brought the skin on to the river bends, welcomed that which falls apart,
and were at last capable, with the belief of a stealthy migrant, of understanding
that all is lost yet in another place, and after this in yet another
and that by the end of each morning in another morning
all is uncertain, just like a dandelion in a field of wheat,
as muted as the exhausted vein of the unburied.
in the attic where night and day roam
the wind replies, cutting the chalk and the rye, and the candle,
shimmering in the light of the veiled stars already gone,
trodden, voiceless, swallowed up by the seventh winter,
spears the heart and the ruin — the meridians undress, fly away
in twenty five years that were just kissing yesterday, and be it told or untold

by lips that only women know

the beginning and the end of your power on earth.",pt_XX,en_XX,"Alexander's journey to India
You walked from one side of the earth to the other in endless life,
You had exiles, pious jealousies, faith faded,

eyes shameless, the reflection of irons in the tumult,
fringes of Alexander's childish dominion, watching Gaugamela.
You left in a port of transition to the uprising,
with emptiness behind, all the time able to see,
and at the first winter, through the cardinals of its ashes,
you began the crossing that never ends, the story that never ends.

i’m thinking of you, dear girl,
your mother’s memory haunts me.
my eyes fill up with tears,
they are bathing you gently.
you were born amid sorrow—
may it yet prove a blessing.
since fortune, struck with envy,
singled you out at birth.
gone forever was contentment,
you heard no joyful voices.
your mother’s life had ended,
while ours went on in sadness.
in anguish born and raised!
i don’t know where all this is going.
i’ve watched you grow, my girl,
with green eyes so lovely.
beauty like yours wasn’t meant
to be born in exile. curses on
fate! this was clearly a work
of malevolence, not a mistake.
here lies your mother,
and we languish in grief.
you did nothing, my girl,
to incur a loss so great.
the fates spurn reason,
and will admit no protest.
i pity your poor father,
for the pain he must lament.
i heard you crying, alone,
before anyone else. you’d not
be here, had i not been there.
still, i ask if i did right.
but surely it can’t be wrong
for you to have been born
with that elegant smile of yours,
those dazzling green eyes.
it’s an unlikely comfort
that i take for myself.
may god grant you the grace
that has eluded you till now.
beauty and good fortune,
or so the old story goes,
were once the best of friends,
but became bitterly opposed.
many hold that it’s fantasy,
but in my life i’ve seen
enough not to doubt it:
fate inflicts great damage.
no harm is ever believed;
we always expect the good.
in hoping and believing
lies an element of change,
an element of concern.",pt_XX,en_XX,"of the girl and lass

fortune envied you:
contentment was dead
you heard no joy,
your mother had passed away,
we were all sad:
nothing grown in pain
I don't know where this will lead
I see you, beautiful daughter
growing with green eyes:
this grace was not yours
to be born in exile
ill be the misfortune
that put more into this than error:
your mother had her grave here
and sorrow for us
you were not daughter, no
for them to die for you:
there was no reason in fate
nor is it allowed to plead
for your father I have more pity
than for himself to complain:
I listened to you alone
before anyone else
you were not theirs, it wasn't
I don't know if I did wrong or right:
but it cannot be madam
for you to be born to any harm
with this gracious smile
that you have beneath green eyes:
more doubtful comfort
this that I take like this
may God give you better fortune
than what you've had so far:
for happiness and beauty
old tales say lies
that once they fought
when they were once very friendly:
many think it's fantasy

doubt nothing

antre tejo e odiana,
que era perdido de amor

que lhe morreu de cansado
que alentejo era enxuto
d’água, e mui seco de prado
toda a terra foi perdida
no campo do tejo só
achava o gado guarida
ver alentejo era um dó:
e jano, pera salvar
o gado que lhe ficou,
foi esta terra buscar,
e um cuidado levou,
outro foi ele lá achar
o dia que ali chegou
com seu gado e com seu fato
com tudo se agasalhou
em uma bicada de um mato:
e levando-o a pascer

que andava pela ribeira
do tejo: a flores colher
vestido branco trazia
um pouco afrontada andava
fermosa bem parecia
aos olhos de quem na olhava:
jano em vendo-a foi pasmado
mas por ver que ela fazia
escondeu-se antre um prado:
joana flores colhia
jano colhia cuidado
despois que ela teve as flores
já colhidas e escolhidas,
as desvariadas cores
com rosas entremetidas:
fez delas uma capela
e soltou os seus cabelos
que eram tão longos como ela
e de cada um a jano em vê-los
lhe nascia uma querela
e em quanto aquisto fazia
joana: o seu gado andava
por dentro da água fria
todo após quem o guiava:
dum pato grande era guia
e todo junto em carreira
ora rio acima ia,
ora, na mesma maneira
o rio abaixo descia
joana como assentou
a capela: foi com a mão
à cabeça, e atentou
se estava em boa feição:
não ficando satisfeita
do que da mão presumia
partiu-se dali direita
para onde o rio fazia
d’água: uma mansa, colheita
chegando à beira do rio,
as patas logo vieram
todas uma e uma, em fio,
que toda a água moveram:
de quanto ela já folgou
com aquestes gasalhados
tanto entonces lhe pesou
e com pedras e com brados
d’ali longe as enxotou
depois que elas foram idas
e que a água assossegou
joana as abas erguidas
entrar pel’água ordenou,
e assentando-se então
as çapatas descalçou
e pondo-as sobre o chão
por dentro d’água entrou
e a jano polo coração
em quanto com passos quedos
joana pela água ia
antre uns desejos e medos
jano onde estava ardia:
não sabia se falasse
se saísse, se estivesse
que o amor mandava que ousasse
e por que a não perdesse
fazia que arreceasse
dizem que naqueste meo
se esteve joana olhando
e descobrindo o seu seo
olhou-se, e dixe um ai dando:
eu guardo patas coitada
não sei onde isto há de ir ter
mais era eu pera guardada
que concerto foi este ser
fermosa, e mal empregada
em aquisto jano ouvindo
não se pôde em si sofrer
que d’antre as ervas saindo
se não lançasse a correr:
joana quando sentiu
os estrompidos de jano
e que se virou e o viu
temor do presente dano
lhe deu pés com que fugiu
mui perto estava o casal
onde vivia o pai dela
que fez ir mais longe o mal
que jano teve de vê-la:
mas o medo que causou
joana partir-se assi
tanto as mãos lhe embaraçou
que a çapata esquerda ali
com a pressa lhe ficou
jano quando viu, e olhou
que nenhum remédio havia
pera o lugar se tornou
aonde ela n’água se via:
e vendo a çapata estar
no areal, à beira d’água
foi correndo a abraçar
tomando-a cresceu-lhe a mágoa
e começou de chorar
toda a çapata e os peitos
em lagrimas se banharam
muitos foram os respeitos
que tanto choro causaram:
encostado ao seu cajado
a çapata na outra mão
despois de um longo cuidado
de dentro do coração
começou falar cansado

que alguns cuidados tivesse
não me matavam cuidando,

e segundo em mi vou vendo
não podem ser outros fados
meus cuidados não entendo

há tanta contrariedade
que sento contra o que sento

o desterraram por ela,

dixe um suspiro dando
ai cuidado, e mais cuidado:

franco, após o saudar
falar-lhe assi começou
franco cuidava eu agora jano
que estavas em outra parte
e polo teu, aqueste ano
me pesava ir por esta arte:
dessejava ver-te aqui
quando me contava alguém
a seca grande que hai
em alentejo, e porém
não quisera eu ver-te assi
conta-me que mal foi este
que tão demudado estás
ou que houveste ou perdeste
se há remédio havê-lo-ás:
faz jano então por se erguer
não podendo de cansado
foi-lhe a mão, franco, estender
e a um freixo encostado
lhe começou responder
jano
vim a estes campos que vejo
por dar vida a este meu gado
vi acabado um desejo,
outro maior começado:
às minhas vacas dei vida
e a mim a fui tirar
a profecia é cumprida
que me pierio foi dar

por que sei que és meu amigo
tudo te quero contar:
nem remédio nem conforto
não te hei franco de pedir
que do mal em que estou posto
não me espero de remir
senão despois que for morto
dia era de um grão vodo
que a um santo se fazia
onde ia o povo todo
por ver e por romaria,
lembra-me que andava eu então
vestido todo de novo
ao ombro um chapeirão
que pasmava todo o povo
com um cajado na mão
tomando-me pelo braço
pierio, então me levou
d’ali um grande pedaço
onde milhor sombra achou:
e mandando-me assentar
ele também se assentou
e antes de começar
pera mim um pouco olhou
e a voltas de chorar

vejo-te (me dixe) jano,
dos bens do mundo abastado
mas contando ano e ano
fico de todo cortado:
vejo-te lá pela idade
de nuve negra cercado
vejo-te sem liberdade
de tua terra desterrado
e mais de tua vontade
em terra que inda não viste,
pelo que nela hás de ver,
vejo-te o coração triste
pera em dias que viver,
hás de morrer de uma dor
de que agora andas bem fora
por isso vive em temor
que não sabe homem aquela hora
em que lhe há de vir o amor
não pode já longe vir
jano aquisto que te digo
vejo-te a barba pungir
olha como andas contigo:
à terra estranha irás
por teu gado não perderes
longos males passarás
por uns mui breves prazeres
que verás ou não verás
(e dando um pouco á cabeça,
á maneira d’anojado)
por teu bem porém te cresça
a barba (dixe) de honrado:
treslada-o no coração
isto que te aqui direi
que ainda que te aqui direi
que ainda alguns tempos virão
jano, que te alembrarei
mande deus que seja em vão
por cobrares a fazenda
a ti mesmo perderás
perda que não tem emenda
despois quando o saberás:
nos campos de uma ribeira
onde vales há a lugares
te está guardada a primeira
causa destes teus pesares
noutra parte a derradeira
jeitos em cousas pequenas
louros cabelos ondados
porão pera sempre em penas
a ti e a teus cuidados:
falas cheas de desdém
de presunção cheas delas
cousas que outras cousas têm
te causarão as querelas
de que morrer te convém
de todo o que te hei contado
todo casi aconteceu

between the rivers tagus
and guadiana, there lived,
it’s said, a shepherd lost
in love for one joana.
the maiden kept ducks
along the tagus’s banks,
her father’s house nearby.
the shepherd’s name was jano,
he hailed from alentejo.
when famine swept the land,
laying it all to waste,
the shepherd, seeking refuge,
fled torrão, his village.
he took with him the remnants
of his once-great flock,
the rest dead of exhaustion.
the drought-struck alentejo
was rather poor in pasture.
everywhere was the piteous
sight of barren fields!
only in the tagus’s
meadows could his flock
find relief. and so jano,
to save his dwindling herd,
set out for land to graze on.
the heart he held was troubled,
and trouble was waiting ahead.
the day that he arrived
with goats and sheep in tow,
he pitched camp at the edge
of a wood. the next morning,
while taking his flock to feed
along the river’s margins,
he laid eyes on joana,
out picking the flowers
that lined the tagus’s banks.
the dress she wore was white,
her cheeks were lightly flushed,
to jano, his eyes agog,
she looked fair and lovely.
though smitten at first sight,
he crouched behind the reeds,
admiring her from a distance.
joana gathered flowers,
in jano passion gathered.
after she had collected
her flowers and selected
the various shades, weaving
the blossoms together with roses,
she made a garland, and let
her hair fall: those tresses
were as long as she was tall.
every lock of her hair
was awakening jano’s desire.
as joana tidied her hair,
her flock of hens waddled
into the cool water,
guided by a huge mallard.
they swam, now upriver,
all in one direction,
now swiftly swam downstream,
together in single file.
joana placed the garland
on her head, stroking it
with her hands to see if
all sat perfectly in place.
not quite satisfied
with what her fingers revealed,
straight away she went
to where the river formed
a cove of placid water.
no sooner had she reached
the bank than her ducks came
flocking towards her, one after
the other, splashing wildly.
initially she’d delighted
in these shows of affection,
quickly her heart grew heavy.
flinging rocks and jeers,
she shooed the ducks away.
once they were all gone,
and the water calm again,
joana tucked her skirt up,
preparing for a swim.
she sat upon the bank,
carefully removing her slippers,
placing each on the ground.
then into the water she went,
and deep into jano’s heart.
as joana took delicate
steps into the river,
jano kept utterly still,
ablaze with desire and fear.
whether to speak, run,
stay put — he didn’t know.
love demanded boldness,
and yet the very thought of
losing her stirred up dread.
all this time joana
stood gazing at her reflection.
staring at her bosom,
she gave a sigh and said:
“what torment! a keeper
of ducks, i should be kept.
where is my life going?
what cruel sense of harmony:
to be fair and drudging away!
hearing these words jano
couldn’t contain himself.
having no other choice,
he burst out the grassy bank.
joana, feeling the thunderous
crash of jano’s footsteps,
turned and saw his face.
sensing the danger at hand,
she swiftly ran toward home.
the house where her father lived
was near, which plunged jano
further into the despair
born of their encounter.
the same fear that had urged
joana’s feet forward
also completely seized
her hands — and in her haste
she grabbed only one slipper.
looking around jano
saw there was no remedy,
turning his gaze to where
joana had studied her image.
when he spotted her slipper
on top the pebbly shore,
he raced over to retrieve it.
squeezing it in his arms,
he felt his sorrow grow,
and began to weep, bathing
his chest and the slipper in tears.
many were the reasons
for his anguished weeping.
leaning against his staff,
holding the slipper tightly,
jano paused for a moment
then he spoke from the heart,
exhausted and teary-eyed.
jano
“o remnant of the fairest
thing that i’ve ever seen,
to my eyes you are a rose,
and to my heart, thistles.
slipper cruelly forgotten,
remembering cruel passion,
who left you sweeps me away—
what an unfair exchange!
alas, that’s the way it must be.
“in my twenty-one years
i can’t remember feeling
even a pang of sorrow,
my flock’s troubles aside.
today, by some strange fate,
— i don’t know when exactly—,
i was racked by a yearning
that eclipsed my other cares,
becoming estranged myself.
“before this present sorrow,
which only multiplies,
although i had my cares,
the caring didn’t kill me.
but now it’s far too late,
i sense the change within,
my fate’s already sealed.
i do not grasp my anguish,
and languish of this passion.
“all i think is riddled
with glaring contradictions:
i oppose what i desire,
while desiring the opposite.
what i feel is so muddled,
i’m at odds with myself.
where might i look for relief?
i know the danger is grave—
graver is my confusion.
“who brought me to this strange
land, where an all-out war
awaited me and where i had
my hope taken away?
i scarcely can believe it:
here i am, reduced
to tears, passion’s slave.
the eyes with which i glimpsed
my beloved are taking revenge.
“my sorrow is greater still:
i brought this all on myself,
culprit and victim of infinite
suffering. had i only
stayed hidden in the reeds,
i would have feasted my eyes
on her beauty, and then —
since it has to be this way —,
at least i’d have my memory.
“disaster upon disaster!
yesterday i came here,
thinking my troubles gone.
oh how i was mistaken!
though i’d begun to hope
that, with my flock restored,
some good might come my way,
sadly, fortune willed
that i should suffer on.
“accursed love! who made me
love's prisoner knows none.
my sad, lonely eyes,
having met her gaze
on the banks of this river
that stretches unto infinity,
carrying water to sea:
you’ll be the faithful witnesses
to all my weighty sorrows.
author
having said these words,
transported by his passion,
jano fell on the sand,
like a man starved of air.
after some time had gone by,
jano still lying senseless,
a shepherd he used to know
passed by, noting the man
fast asleep on the ground.
franco of sandovir
was his name—searching
for a flute he had lost
but loved better than life,
this shepherd was adored
by none less than celia,
that finest of nymphs who bathed
in the mondego’s waters,
hers the sweetest of voices.
she gave the flute to franco
when he was leaving for exile
—imposed on him for his love—,
he weeping as she wept.
he had come here to live,
finding the landscape appropriate
for his aching heart:
rugged hills on all sides,
open fields to gaze on.
born to very little
in villages far apart,
these two shepherds had been
friends in bygone days.
for this reason franco
turned to take another
look at the man lying
on the ground, sensing
that something was amiss.
franco struggled greatly
deciding what to do—
were he to leave jano
behind, his heart would ache.
nor did he think it wise
to rouse his friend awake.
with jano being asleep
in an unfamiliar place,
he feared that he might startle.
franco wrestling with doubt,
jano turned on his back.
heaving a sigh, he said,
“all i do is suffer!”
when he heard these words,
franco turned around
in astonishment, noticing
the slipper tucked gingerly
beneath jano’s left arm.
he suspected what it was,
for he too was in love.
in jano’s bitter words
he’d all the proof he needed.
jano, now fully alert,
realizing it was franco,
stared in bewildered silence.
franco greeted him warmly
and with these words began:
franco
“why jano, i had thought
you lived in other parts.
i feared, for you and your flock,
the year might go this way.
when i caught word of the drought
now sweeping alentejo,
i hoped i’d see you here,
though certainly not in this state.
“tell me what harm’s been done
that you should be so changed?
what trouble found? thing lost?
if there’s a cure, you’ll have it.”
when jano, still quite weak,
tried to get up but stumbled,
franco held out his hand.
leaning against the trunk
of an ash tree jano said:
jano
“i came to the fields before me
to give life to my flock.
i slaked one desire only
to know greater thirst.
to my cattle i gave life,
having taken my own!
the prophecy’s been fulfilled,
as revealed by pierio,
when my first beard came in.
author
“among shepherds,” said franco,
“his reputation precedes him.
he considers all his friends;
he’s given, they say, to affairs.
now, jano, tell me this,
if he warned you in advance,
why this present hardship?
i hear he’s an honest friend
to men and women both.”
jano
“franco, i’ve grown so weary,
of the sorrow i’ve found
since coming to this place,
i can feel the strain in my voice.
whatever fortune brings,
a man can’t resist his fate,
what will be, will be—
there’s no escaping it, no point
fighting it, no hiding away.
“but with you, dear franco,
i can freely vent my pain.
knowing you to be a friend,
i wish to tell you everything.
i don’t ask that you provide
comfort or remedy, franco.
fr i can’t hope to be saved
from the trouble i’m in,
at least not till i die.
“it was a saint’s day feast:
all the people huddled
together, pilgrims come
from far and wide to see.
that day i remember dressing
in all new clothes, draped on
my shoulder was a woolen
hood coveted by the crowd.
in my hand i held my staff.
“taking me by the arm,
pierio led me some distance,
to a well-shaded grove.
telling me to take a seat
and sitting down next to me,
he paused and stared a while,
not saying a word, looking
on the verge of tears.
pierio
“jano,” he said, “i see
you don’t lack for worldly goods.
but with each passing year
my outlook grows more grim.
i see a black cloud looming.
now that you’re of age,
i see you stripped of freedom,
in exile far from home,
still farther from your will.
“in a land you’ve yet to see,
you’ll catch sight of something
that fills your heart with sorrow
for the rest of your days.
you’ll die of an affliction
that’s now just a distant threat.
live, therefore, in fear,
for no man knows the hour
when love will choose to strike.
“jano, the things i’ve said
can’t be very far away:
i see the down on your lip;
look at how you’re acting.
you’ll travel to a strange land
so as not to lose your flock,
enduring bitter hardships
for the briefest of pleasures,
so you’ll see, should you choose.”
pierio shook his head,
a stern look on his face.
“now, for your own sake,
act with manly honor,
and etch onto your heart
the words i’m about to say.
some hard days lie ahead,
jano, i must remind you.
may god prove me wrong!”
“in trying to save your flock,
you’ll become lost to yourself—
a loss that’s beyond repair
by the time it registers.
in the fields by the river,
among valleys, there lurks
your suffering’s first cause.
elsewhere you’ll meet your demise:
“her dainty mannerisms,
her wavy blonde hair
will subject your heart and mind
to never-ending punishment.
words laced with disdain,
words uttered in scorn,
a vast array of injuries —
it’ll all make you complain
so bitterly, you’d rather die.”
jano
“nearly all that i’ve said
happened as predicted.
what’s not yet come to pass,
the past has set in motion.
just a short while ago,
i caught sight of a lady
my eyes keep searching for.
my life and soul, she’s gone,
having deemed me unworthy.”
author
while jano spoke, a bloodhound
belonging to franco found
the missing flute, clutching it
with its teeth. when he saw,
bursting with joy, franco
ran to retrieve the flute.
standing on its hind legs,
the dog placed it in his hands,
proceeding to roll on its back.
franco turned to jano,
then he said these words:
“when he sees what he’s pined for,
a man forgets all else.
i cut your story short—
for that you’ll have to blame
whom i can’t, or forgive me
yourself, jano. you know
what it means to be in love.”
“that flute must be dear to you
as few things are,” said jano.
“indeed, nothing’s dearer,”
franco said in response.
“whoever gave you that
must have you in her debt,”
jano said to franco,
“truly you must play well ,
unless the dog got it wrong.”
“sing something, franco,
sadness loves a song!
let us see if your music
can’t soothe my bitter sorrow.”
“of course,” franco said,
“i will sing for you, jano,
as one sings for an ailing man.
although truth be told,
my song is but a wail.”
“i would like for you to hear
the song i sang last night,
after i had lost my flute,
left with only my voice.
when at last i went to bed,
i wasn’t tired of searching,
but weary of finding nothing.
now, jano, i mean it,
i couldn’t shut my eyes.”
“there, in the deep of night,
when all was utterly still,
i belted out my song,
an owl kept me company.
from his faraway perch,
—perhaps i only imagined it—
the owl would respond with sighs
as heavy as my own.
at any rate, here goes.”
song
wandering in exile i ask:
what to do, where to go?
after the deepest despair,
i’ve found the greatest sorrow.
the anguish! i’m a roving
stranger in remote lands,
to which i came in search
of refuge for my flock!
i, to whom cruel fortune
affords no consolation,
fear that, being ill-fated,
i will one day be made
to die by my own hand.
how to explain myself
to one not here to ask me?
how to beg forgiveness
of one who cannot hear me?
o gift of my beloved,
whose absence shrouds the night,
my flute, lost forever!
make a grave and bury me:
i perished long ago…
and upon my tombstone,
let these words be written:
in her heart lies my soul.
if on a distant day
in years to come, celia,
wherever she may be,
having heard the smallest
portion of all i suffered,
were to fall to pieces,
unable to hold back tears—
then would my soul be sated,
or whatever remains of me.
though i ask for nothing,
since i suffer so greatly,
let my eyes drift in reverie.
day after day slips by.
these lonely nights were made
for anguished spirits like ours.
“that’s the song, dear jano,
i believed it was my last;
i confess i hoped it’d mark
the end of all my suffering.
if mind and soul don’t perish
with the body, my sorrow
will remain. let us go,
it’s time the flock grazed,
torment too has its season.”",pt_XX,en_XX,Second,0

o repuxo animava sem triunfo o pântano
da juventude
as varandas em fogo
o verão começando pelo fim
horas extraordinárias aquelas
em que as aves adiavam o repouso por causa
dos insectos do turno sequente
ourados absortos estrepitantes
a hora em que mais ninguém deitava como eu
a bicicleta sobre a falta
e se sentava na relva prendendo as lágrimas
as mãos tapando o rosto o rosto entre os geolhos e uma
roda atrás a girar
não havia o ecrã de bolso oportuno
era inevitável encarar o que não tem conserto
nem nunca terá
era do dia o instante altíloquo
uma harmónica crepitava nos auscultadores
feria de morte o touro da tarde
esse búfalo ermo que se aparta da manada
para ficar-se
os subidos candeeiros acendiam
havia um muro recém pintado
sujo já por um grafito de província
um cão passava ao largo levantava o focinho ao
perfume dos jantares
que chegava de onde
se entrevia o espalha-cor dos televisores
havia o farrapo de lua
como flanela posta sobre a ganga das alturas
agraudava os dós arrumados
na caixa do futuro
a hédera das extensões percorria aquela hora
uma ideia sulcava a charneca celeste
o coração alpinista no avesso dos volumes
rarefeito
o mundo era já uma seara de nojo
e fartura – belo desastroso feroz – lugar de forças
e destruições
eu tacteava de olhos fechados

procurava um celeiro urbano onde guardar

that moment when i was really falling apart
and the sun lingered over the lawn, and the palms
billowed above the turbid lake
faraway the promised beetle
reduced those palms to a stump
until they seemed like a pineapple which these days
rots in the gardens
the fountain blandly animated the swamp
of the young
the balconies on fire
the summer beginning at its end
overtime hours those
in which the birds delayed their naps because
of the next shift of insects
hallucinating self-absorbed clamorous
at that hour no one else like me setting their bicycle
down on the dearth
sitting on the grass holding back tears
covering their face with their hands, face between their knees and a
wheel behind still spinning
there was no convenient pocket screen
facing up to that which can’t be fixed and never will be
was inevitable
it was on that day the eloquent moment
a harmonica crackled in my headphones
mortally wounding the afternoon’s bull
that solitary buffalo that steers clear of the herd
to die
the high lamps lit up
a newly painted wall
already marked with a small town’s graffito
a dog went past lifting its snout to the
scent of dinners
which came from where
the televisions’ color-blend rose in the air
there was the shred of moon
like flannel sewn onto the denim of the heights
it nurtured hoarded hurt
in the box of the future
the ivy of extensions twined through that hour
an idea furrowed the celestial fen
the mountaineer heart inside the volumes
rarefied
the world was already a glebe of lamentation
and overabundance – beautiful disastrous fierce – locus of forces
and ruin
i fingered with my eyes closed
pure intrinsic
searched out an urban granary where i could keep
the semen-gold ready to detonate
the extreme dragonfly the first cricket
the swallow who got up its nest in a cumulus
of mud and dried weeds who smooths
the surfaces feeding itself in the air
at my back the exiguous cooling
of the public library
at that hour a cavern of nebulous soldiers
resting from their war of resistance
hasta la derrota, siempre!
they inflicted little damage on a rough
but reluctant enemy
only those as sullen as i
walked into ambushes
so many figure eights still visible on the ground
forcefully hoed up from repeatedly going round in the same place
i had dared to go past the gate of the infinite
always ending up bent over dinner",pt_XX,en_XX,"[neil young]
at the hour when I most crumbled
the sun smoothed the lawn, palm trees
rippled in a murky lake
far away the forthcoming beetle
that reduced them to a stump
resembling a degrading pineapple today
in the gardens
the fountain animated without triumph the swamp
of youth
the balconies ablaze
summer beginning at the end
extraordinary hours those
when the birds postponed rest because
of the insects of the following shift
golden absorbed clamorous
the hour when no one else lay like me
the bicycle over the lack
and sat on the grass holding back tears
hands covering the face the face between the eyes and a
wheel spinning behind
there was no timely pocket screen
it was inevitable to face what cannot be fixed
nor ever will
it was the moment's eloquent day
a harmonica crackled in the headphones
fatally wounded the afternoon's bull
that solitary buffalo that separates from the herd
to remain
the elevated streetlights lit up
there was a freshly painted wall
already dirty with a provincial graffiti
a dog passed by raising its nose to the
perfume of dinners
coming from where
the spread of televisions could be seen
there was the ragged moon
like a cloth laid over the denim of the heights
aggrandizing the arranged C's
in the future box
the ivy of the extensions traversed that hour
an idea plowed the celestial wasteland
the mountaineer heart inside out of the volumes
rarefied
the world was already a field of disgust
and plenty - beautiful disastrous fierce - place of forces
and destructions
I groped with closed eyes
pure intrinsic
searching for an urban barn to store
the ready-to-detonate seed-gold
the extreme dragonfly the initial cricket
the swallow whose nest results from a heap
of mud and dry herbs and rake
the surfaces feeding in the air
on my back the scant refreshment
of the public library
at that hour a den of nebulous soldiers
resting from the guerrilla fight
hasta la derrota, siempre!
they inflicted minimal damage on a
clumsy but reluctant enemy
only those more gloomy like me fell
ambushes
visible eight still on the ground
plowed by the force of spinning in the same place
dared to pierce the portal of the infinite
always dying bent over dinner",-1

what, kind or relation, though i find

planará por ravinas desfiladeiros

i’m watching her:
sweet the alp in the angle of her jaw
when she wakes
the canvas soaked at dawn
the grass outside darkens just as the sun rising
dilutes sleep
the mules feed off the fleeting
boreal pastures
before us a way opens up
luminously
glued to keeping quiet
to moving
but a breeze already inflames
making us want for a lake, placing
a range on the horizon
a less uncrossable elevation
than the lowlands of lived life
we say goodbye to the humid moss
fingered between thighs
stir the last pleasure out of the little
campfire that crackled
at the shelter’s opening through the long cold hours
we stuff rucksacks
leather and straps tested
we fixed our hair
munch a bit of flour
shredded bits of jerky
swigs of steaming coffee
we, the soldiers of alexander
whom nights of whiskey never fell
whose boots don’t weigh a thing
nor shame the fevers
the rectangle left by the tent
will remain for a while marking the plot of grass
stones ringing what had been
a scintillating flame later gone dark
now pasture to the scent of the timid
animals that will wander in
sounding out this sullied bit of the scene
at this very moment our scent
sails through narrow ravines
mixed with the dust and the clamor of hoofs that brings us
straying close on the edge of precipices
our own echoing
will embarrass us
but within – more silence even than the gorse
on the cliff sides –
and hardened, soaked with mist, atypical
arching over our maps
opening compasses
jotting quick notes about the way
and the error
more goat than us more mountainous: life
this leather hard to tan",pt_XX,en_XX,"[annemarie schwarzenbach]
I look at her:
the sweet apex at the angle of the jaw
when she awakens
the canvas soaked in dawn
outside the grass dyes as much as the star above leaps
dilutes sleep
the mules feed on the fatuous
boreal pastures
ahead of us a path articulates
illuminating
attached to silence
to movement
but a breath already ignites
restores in us the desire for a lake, places
on the horizon the mountain range
an elevation less impassable
than the plain of the lived
we bid farewell to the damp moss
pressed between thighs
we shake off what remains of pleasure
the small glimmer that at the mouth of the shelter
crackled for long cold hours
we stuff backpacks
tested leathers and bindings
hair neatly done
we carry to our teeth a bit of flour
threads of dried meat
sips of steaming coffee
we, soldiers of alexandre
to whom the whiskey of evenings never fell
and the boots don't weigh down
nor do the fevers vex
the rectangle where the tent tarried
will be marked for a while in the grass
with the stones surrounding what once was
the flickering flame that later charred
and is fodder for the timid
fauna that will come
to probe this stained part of the place
by then our scent
will drift through ravines gorges
mixed with dust and the clatter of hooves with which
we roam by the edge of abysses
we will produce echoes that our modesty
will shrink from
but inside - more taciturn than the roar
of cliffs -
and harsh, gnawing, rare
bulging the view over maps
uncovering compasses
taking small notes on the course

plágio manhoso do big-bang

do buraco negro a que chamam literatura

capazes de acelerar partículas

mas a região mais central do nada, o pátio
furioso da potência
e neste lugar de substâncias, de objectos
as palavras são figuras do imundo, coisas que
sobraram do estampido inaugural desse dia inicial inteiro
e limpo que culminou no lugar a menos deste texto
breve logaritmo sem aplicação ou saída
resta ao poeta o embuste
de afirmar o que propende para o infindo
espiar o acesso que cada coisa consente pela fissura do milagre
e dá pelo nome de imprevisto, ou acidente

the big bang’s nimble plagiarism
the poem’s matter expands, cools
it lingers so oddly then stays put
similar to the universe
the poem is a mirror image of the body
with no reflection: hollow
asymmetrical, vestiges of that origin
positioned in a dubious place, nearly always apart
from the black hole they call literature
it might be imagined that few are the poets
capable of accelerating particles
as a way of seeing not only the distance the light has covered
but the central region of nihility, the furious
patio of power
and in this place of substances, of objects
the words are figures of waste, things
left over from the inaugural detonation of this first clean
whole day that climaxed in the minus-one ground of this brief logarithmic
text, purposeless and without any application

to voice what leans into the infinite
to secretly observe the access each thing allows through the fissure of miracle
and which goes by the name of chance, or accident

high burgeoning snowflake a magnolia blooms and blooms

to its dominion

guindastes do porto de roterdão, e apago-o com
a borracha da eternidade, para que ela se sente

das mães, afogavam-se em lama, no meio dos sambos. as paredes
das casas diluíam-se em nata e os oleiros desistiram de encomendar
a sua obra a deus. enormes cuidados foram inventados
para proteger o fogo nos altares e as crianças adoptaram a nudez.
as termiteiras deixaram de existir e as formigas aladas
perderam as asas. os pés dos mais-velhos fenderam-se em chagas
e as mamas das virgens, mal eram tocadas, colavam-se aos dedos
como cinza húmida. os lábios dos sexos das mulheres paridas
inchavam carnudos de uma carne branca e os ventres pendiam
como fruta mole.

ficou colado ao trono e ao boi sagrado cresceram-lhe os olhos,
que depois cegaram. as sementes grelaram nos celeiros
e essa semente assim era servida aos homens e daí lhes ocorreu
um tal vigor que os seus sexos cresceram desmedidos
e os homens vacilaram, tendo-os nas mãos e mudos de fascínio.
a chuva choveu tanto que as serpentes saíram dos buracos
e vieram alongar-se ao pé dos paus, mantendo com esforço
as cabeças erguidas. nas terrinas do leite vicejavam musgos
e o leite das vacas alterou-se em soro, a coalhar na urina.

talos e as enxurradas produziram peixe e até o ferro se lavou
sozinho e os diamantes vieram rebolar nas pedras concavadas
de moer farinha. as próprias aves morreram quase todas
e apenas se salvaram as de penas brancas, que a distância atraiu,
depois comeu.
e aquela chuva aproveitou aos fósseis e houve minerais
que se animaram e até pedras comuns a transmudar-se em carne.

o sentido. as gargantas entupiram-se de limos
e as testas que os velhos pousavam nas mãos fundiam-se aos dedos
e os braços às pernas e os gestos de graça fundiam os corpos
e as jovens crianças ficavam coladas ao peito das mães.
só as bocas teimavam em manter-se abertas e quando mais tarde
a chuva parou, das bocas saíram grossas aves negras
que abalaram logo daquelas paragens. e a seca voltou

to protect the altar flames and the children started to run around naked.

branches and the rushing streams spawned fish and even the iron washed itself alone and diamonds started to tumble around the stones hollowed out for milling flour. the birds themselves nearly all died and the only ones that saved themselves were those with white feathers, which the distance attracted, then ate.

"os figos de d.h. lawrence
lawrence aconselhou a que se partisse um figo
em quatro pedaços, para o comer, depois de deitar fora
a casca. deste modo, pensava ele, a sociedade não veria
com maus olhos o gesto de cortar o figo, e de o
saborear lentamente, como quem lê um poema. mas
nem todos os figos se podem comer desta maneira; e,
no caso dos figos verdes, o melhor é tirar-lhes a pele a
partir de cima, sem que ela se desprenda completamente
do fruto; e só depois de comer a parte de cima, é que
chegará o momento em que só vai ficar um pouco de figo
a segurar a casca. nessa altura, pode-se arrancá-la, e acabar
de comer o que sobra, para que a refeição fique completa.
de facto, lawrence também admite esta solução (e
aceita que se coma também a casca); mas teremos
de ir mais longe do que ele, o que significa
que se deve também pensar na figueira. e se, ao comermos
o figo, a árvore nos agarra a alma com os seus ramos
ásperos, obrigando-nos a afastar as folhas para ver como
é que se pode fugir debaixo dela, o sabor que fica na boca
lembra a imagem da mulher primitiva, com o seu ventre redondo
como o dos figos de s. joão, os primeiros, que se colhem
com um gesto só, ficando inteiros na mão. então, a mão
torna-se um prolongamento da figueira, e começo a pensar
que talvez possam nascer folhas de figueira nos braços,
como se estes fossem ramos; e que essas folhas servirão para
tapar os figos que irei colher, mantendo a sua frescura.
em alternativa, poderei transformar o tronco da figueira
num corpo de mulher nua; e essas folhas irão vesti-la. mas o figo
que tenho na mão far-me-á sentir os seus seios macios, fazendo
com que, ao tirar a casca do figo, a mulher saia de dentro dele,
e eu possa chegar à mesma conclusão de lawrence sobre
as múltiplas formas de comer um figo.","d.h. lawrence’s figs
lawrence recommended that the fig be divided into
into four pieces, for eating, after discarding
the skin. in this way, he reasoned, society would not look
askance upon the act of cutting open the fig and of
savoring it slowly, as one would read a poem. but
not all figs can be eaten in such a way; and
in the case of green figs, it’s better to skin them from
the top down, without separating the skin completely
from the fruit; it’s only after eating the top part, that
the moment arrives where there is only a bit of fig left
clinging to its skin. then you can finally pluck it, and finish
eating what is left, for the meal to be complete.
indeed, lawrence also acknowledges this solution (and
also says it’s okay to eat the skin); but we must
go even further than he does, which means that we must
also consider the tree itself. and if, while we’re eating
the fig, the tree grabs our soul with its rough
branches, making it necessary to pull back its leaves to see how
it is we can escape beneath it, the taste which lingers in the mouth
recalls the image of the primitive woman, with her round womb
like the one of the early figs of saint john, the first ones, that are gathered up
whole, in one sweep of the hand. so, my hand
becomes an extension of the fig tree, and i begin to think
that perhaps fig leaves will start growing from my arms,
as though they were branches; and that these leaves will hide
the figs that i will gather, keeping them fresh.
alternatively, i could transform the trunk of the fig tree
into the body of a naked woman; and these leaves would adorn her. but the fig
that i have in my hand will make me feel her soft breasts, making
it seem like in stripping the skin from the fig the woman might appear from within,
and i would reach the same conclusion as lawrence about
the many ways to eat a fig.",pt_XX,en_XX,"The Figs by D.H. Lawrence
Lawrence advised that one should cut a fig
into four pieces, to eat it, after discarding
the peel. In this way, he thought, society wouldn't frown
upon the act of cutting the fig, and of
savoring it slowly, like reading a poem. But
not all figs can be eaten this way; and,
in the case of green figs, it's best to remove the skin
from the top, without completely detaching it
from the fruit; and only after eating the top part, will
come the moment when only a little bit of fig
will be left holding the peel. At that point, it's possible to peel it off,
and finish eating what remains, so the meal is complete.
Indeed, Lawrence also accepts this solution (and
agrees to eat the peel as well); but we must
go further than him, which means
we must also think about the fig tree. And if, while eating
the fig, the tree grabs our soul with its rough branches,
forcing us to push aside the leaves to see how
we can escape from underneath it, the taste that lingers in the mouth
evokes the image of the primitive woman, with her round belly
like the figs of St. John, the first ones, that are picked
with just one gesture, remaining whole in the hand. Then, the hand
becomes an extension of the fig tree, and I start to think
that perhaps fig leaves could grow on the arms,
as if they were branches; and these leaves would serve to
cover the figs I will harvest, preserving their freshness.
Alternatively, I could transform the trunk of the fig tree
into the body of a naked woman; and those leaves would clothe her. But the fig
I have in my hand will make me feel her soft breasts, causing
me, when peeling the fig, to see the woman emerge from within it,
and I may reach the same conclusion as Lawrence about
the many ways to eat a fig.",-1

i
ave-marias
nas nossas ruas, ao anoitecer,
há tal soturnidade, há tal melancolia,
que as sombras, o bulício, o tejo, a maresia
despertam-me um desejo absurdo de sofrer.
o céu parece baixo e de neblina,
o gás extravasado enjoa-me, perturba;
e os edifícios, com as chaminés, e a turba
toldam-se duma cor monótona e londrina.
batem carros de aluguer, ao fundo,
levando à via-férrea os que se vão. felizes!
ocorrem-me em revista exposições, países:
madrid, paris, berlim, s. petersburgo, o mundo!
semelham-se a gaiolas, com viveiros,
as edificações somente emadeiradas:
como morcegos, ao cair das badaladas,
saltam de viga em viga os mestres carpinteiros.
voltam os calafates, aos magotes,
de jaquetão ao ombro, enfarruscados, secos;
embrenho-me, a cismar, por boqueirões, por becos,
ou erro pelos cais a que se atracam botes.
e evoco, então, as crónicas navais:
mouros, baixéis, heróis, tudo ressuscitado!
luta camões no sul, salvando um livro a nado!
singram soberbas naus que eu não verei jamais!
e o fim da tarde inspira-me; e incomoda!
de um couraçado inglês vogam os escaleres;
e em terra num tinir de louças e talheres
flamejam, ao jantar alguns hotéis da moda.
num trem de praça arengam dois dentistas;
um trôpego arlequim braceja numas andas;
os querubins do lar flutuam nas varandas;
às portas, em cabelo, enfadam-se os lojistas!
vazam-se os arsenais e as oficinas;
reluz, viscoso, o rio, apressam-se as obreiras;
e num cardume negro, hercúleas, galhofeiras,
correndo com firmeza, assomam as varinas.
vêm sacudindo as ancas opulentas!
seus troncos varonis recordam-me pilastras;
e algumas, à cabeça, embalam nas canastras
os filhos que depois naufragam nas tormentas.
descalças! nas descargas de carvão,
desde manhã à noite, a bordo das fragatas;
e apinham-se num bairro aonde miam gatas,
e o peixe podre gera os focos de infecção!
ii
noite fechada
toca-se às grades, nas cadeias. som
que mortifica e deixa umas loucuras mansas!
o aljube, em que hoje estão velhinhas e crianças,
bem raramente encerra uma mulher de “dom”!
e eu desconfio, até, de um aneurisma
tão mórbido me sinto, ao acender das luzes;
à vista das prisões, da velha sé, das cruzes,
chora-me o coração que se enche e que se abisma.
a espaços, iluminam-se os andares,
e as tascas, os cafés, as tendas, os estancos
alastram em lençol os seus reflexos brancos;
e a lua lembra o circo e os jogos malabares.
duas igrejas, num saudoso largo,
lançam a nódoa negra e fúnebre do clero:
nelas esfumo um ermo inquisidor severo,
assim que pela história eu me aventuro e alargo.
na parte que abateu no terremoto,
muram-me as construções rectas, iguais, crescidas;
afrontam-me, no resto, as íngremes subidas,
e os sinos dum tanger monástico e devoto.
mas, num recinto público e vulgar,
com bancos de namoro e exíguas pimenteiras,
brônzeo, monumental, de proporções guerreiras,
um épico doutrora ascende, num pilar!
e eu sonho o cólera, imagino a febre,
nesta acumulação de corpos enfezados;
sombrios e espectrais recolhem os soldados;
inflama-se um palácio em face de um casebre.
partem patrulhas de cavalaria
dos arcos dos quartéis que foram já conventos;
idade média! a pé, outras, a passos lentos,
derramam-se por toda a capital, que esfria.
triste cidade! eu temo que me avives
uma paixão defunta! aos lampiões distantes,
enlutam-me, alvejando, as tuas elegantes,
curvadas a sorrir às montras dos ourives.
e mais: as costureiras, as floristas
descem dos magasins, causam-me sobressaltos;
custa-lhes a elevar os seus pescoços altos
e muitas delas são comparsas ou coristas.
e eu, de luneta de uma lente só,
eu acho sempre assunto a quadros revoltados:
entro na brasserie; às mesas de emigrados,
ao riso e à crua luz joga-se o dominó.

ao gás
e saio. a noite pesa, esmaga. nos
passeios de lajedo arrastam-se as impuras.
ó moles hospitais! sai das embocaduras
um sopro que arripia os ombros quase nus.
cercam-me as lojas, tépidas. eu penso
ver círios laterais, ver filas de capelas,
com santos e fiéis, andores, ramos, velas,
em uma catedral de um comprimento imenso.
as burguesinhas do catolicismo
resvalam pelo chão minado pelos canos;
e lembram-me, ao chorar doente dos pianos,
as freiras que os jejuns matavam de histerismo.
num cutileiro, de avental, ao torno,
um forjador maneja um malho, rubramente;
e de uma padaria exala-se, inda quente,
um cheiro salutar e honesto a pão no forno.
e eu que medito um livro que exacerbe,
quisera que o real e a análise mo dessem;
casas de confecções e modas resplandecem;
pelas vitrines olha um ratoneiro imberbe.
longas descidas! não poder pintar
com versos magistrais, salubres e sinceros,
a esguia difusão dos vossos reverberos,
e a vossa palidez romântica e lunar!
que grande cobra, a lúbrica pessoa,
que espartilhada escolhe uns xales com debuxo!
sua excelência atrai, magnética, entre luxo,
que ao longo dos balcões de mogno se amontoa.
e aquela velha, de bandós! por vezes,
a sua traîne imita um leque antigo, aberto,
nas barras verticais, a duas tintas. perto,
escarvam, à vitória, os seus mecklemburgueses.
desdobram-se tecidos estrangeiros;
plantas ornamentais secam nos mostradores;
flocos de pós de arroz pairam sufocadores,
e em nuvens de cetins requebram-se os caixeiros.
mas tudo cansa! apagam-se nas frentes
os candelabros, como estrelas, pouco a pouco;
da solidão regouga um cauteleiro rouco;
tornam-se mausoléus as armações fulgentes.
“dó da miséria!... compaixão de mim!...”
e, nas esquinas, calvo, eterno, sem repouso,
pede-me esmola um homenzinho idoso,
meu velho professor nas aulas de latim!

horas mortas
o tecto fundo de oxigénio, de ar,
estende-se ao comprido, ao meio das trapeiras;
vêm lágrimas de luz dos astros com olheiras,
enleva-me a quimera azul de transmigrar.
por baixo, que portões! que arruamentos!
um parafuso cai nas lajes, às escuras:
colocam-se taipais, rangem as fechaduras,
e os olhos dum caleche espantam-me, sangrentos.
e eu sigo, como as linhas de uma pauta
a dupla correnteza augusta das fachadas;
pois sobem, no silêncio, infaustas e trinadas,
as notas pastoris de uma longínqua flauta.
se eu não morresse, nunca! e eternamente
buscasse e conseguisse a perfeição das cousas!
esqueço-me a prever castíssimas esposas,
que aninhem em mansões de vidro transparente!
ó nossos filhos! que de sonhos ágeis,
pousando, vos trarão a nitidez às vidas!
eu quero as vossas mães e irmãs estremecidas,
numas habitações translúcidas e frágeis.
ah! como a raça ruiva do porvir,
e as frotas dos avós, e os nómadas ardentes,
nós vamos explorar todos os continentes
e pelas vastidões aquáticas seguir!
mas se vivemos, os emparedados,
sem árvores, no vale escuro das muralhas!...
julgo avistar, na treva, as folhas das navalhas
e os gritos de socorro ouvir estrangulados.
e nestes nebulosos corredores
nauseiam-me, surgindo, os ventres das tabernas;
na volta, com saudade, e aos bordos sobre as pernas,
cantam, de braço dado, uns tristes bebedores.
eu não receio, todavia, os roubos;
afastam-se, a distância, os dúbios caminhantes;
e sujos, sem ladrar, ósseos, febris, errantes,
amareladamente, os cães parecem lobos.
e os guardas, que revistam as escadas,
caminham de lanterna e servem de chaveiros;
por cima, as imorais, nos seus roupões ligeiros,
tossem, fumando sobre a pedra das sacadas.
e, enorme, nesta massa irregular
de prédios sepulcrais, com dimensões de montes,
a dor humana busca os amplos horizontes,
e tem marés, de fel, como um sinistro mar!","the feeling of a westerner

vespers
when evening falls across our streets
and sullen melancholy fills the air,
the tagus, the tang, the shadows and bustle
bring me an absurd desire to suffer.
the sky hangs low and seems all hazy;
the gas from the streetlamps makes me queasy;
the tumult of buildings, chimneys and people
is cloaked in a dullish, londonish hue.
oh lucky travellers in hired coaches
now hieing to the railway station! countries
and exhibitions file past me: madrid,
paris, berlin, st petersburg, the world!
the timber frames of future buildings
resemble cages for keeping animals;
like swooping bats the carpenters leap
from beam to beam at the sound of the bell.
clusters of callous, tar-smeared caulkers
return from the slipways, coats on their shoulders;
i wander through alleys that lead to the river
or walk by the wharves where boats are docked.
i evoke the ocean chronicles: the moors,
old vessels and heroes – all resurrected!
shipwrecked camões swims his book to shore! (1)
great carracks that i’ll never see ride the waves!
the twilight inspires, and also disturbs me!
an english battleship launches its cutters
while swank hotels on land bedazzle
with china and flatware clinking at dinner.
two dentists argue inside a streetcar;
a clumsy clown is struggling on stilts;
children flit, like cherubs, on balconies;
hatless, bored shopkeepers wait at their doors!
the shipyards and workshops are emptying out;
the river glints thickly, the workwomen hurry;
and a black school of herculean fishwives
bursts out of nowhere, joking, laughing.
wagging sumptuous hips they come!
their manly torsos remind me of pillars;
and some, in the baskets on their heads,
rock sons who’ll one day drown in storms.
on frigates – barefoot! – they unload coal (2)
from dawn to dusk, then crowd together
in a neighbourhood where cats meow
and the rotting fish breed infection!
ii
after dark
prisoners bang on the bars of their cells –
a sound that rattles my nerves with shame!
the aljube jail, for old women and children,
rarely encloses a titled lady!
i feel so ill as the lights come on
i worry i might have an aneurysm;
the sight of the jails, crosses, cathedral,
fills and sinks my heart with tears.
one floor after another lights up,
and cafés, restaurants, tobacco and other shops
spread like a sheet their white reflections.
the moon brings jugglers, the circus, to mind.
on an ancient square two churches raise
the clergy’s black, funereal spectre;
i sketch there a lonely, dour inquisitor,
daring to extend myself into history.
in quarters which the earthquake flattened
equal, straight buildings wall me in; (3)
everywhere else i face steep streets
and the tolling of pious, monastic bells.
but gracing a common, public square
with lovers’ benches and lithe pepper trees
a war-sized monument cast in bronze
stands, on a pillar, for an epic that was! (4)
and in this assemblage of stunted bodies
i think of the fever, imagine the cholera;
returning soldiers look sombre as ghosts;
a gleaming palace stands opposite a hovel.
mounted patrolmen set out from the archways
of army barracks that once were convents;
the middle ages! others, on foot,
range through the capital, now turning cold.
sad town! i dread you’ll arouse a dead passion
in me! i mourn upon seeing your elegant
ladies so white in the lamp-lit distance,
leaning and smiling at jewellers’ windows.
coming down from the department stores,
the florists and dressmakers wrench my gut;
they’re hardly able to hold up their heads,
and many are walk-ons and chorus girls.
even in sordid human tableaus
i, with my pince-nez, find subject matter:
i enter the beerhouse; at the immigrants’ tables,
harshly lit, they laugh and play dominoes.
iii
by gaslight
and i go back out. the night’s weight crushes.
impure women roam the sidewalks.
o languid hospitals! ill-clad shoulders
shiver from drafts where streets open up.
warm shops surround me. i think i’m seeing
flanking candles, rows of chapels
with saints and the faithful, flowers, more candles,
more saints, in a vastly long cathedral.
the bourgeois women of catholicism
slip on the ground that’s tunnelled by drainpipes.
to me they recall, with their whining pianos,
the nuns who, fasting, died of madness.
an aproned knife maker, working the lathe,
redhotly wields his blacksmith’s hammer;
and bread, still warm, from the baker’s oven
sends forth its honest, wholesome smell.
and i, whose goal is a book that galls,
want it to show and examine what’s real.
boutiques shine with the latest fashions;
a street urchin gapes at their window displays.
o long descents! could i but paint
with skilled, sincere, salubrious verses
the delicate shimmering of your streetlamps
and all your romantic moonlit pallor!
that sensual, corseted creature selecting
printed shawls – she moves like a snake!
her excellence is a magnet amidst
the finery piled on mahogany counters.
and that old dame with coiled plaits!
her train with its vertical, two-tone stripes
mocks a spread fan! her mecklenburg horses
wait with the carriage, pawing the pavement.
decorative plants wilt on the tables
where clerks unroll their foreign fabrics;
in clouds of satins they bow and smile;
rice powder hovers and chokes the air.
but all grows weary! slowly, like stars,
the storefronts’ hanging lights go dim;
the glittering buildings become mausoleums;
a lone, hoarse voice hawks lottery tickets.
and there on a corner: “please, sir! take pity!”
whenever i pass him, that little old man,
bald and eternal, begs for alms:
the teacher at school who taught me latin!
iv
the dead hours
the lofty ceiling of air, of oxygen,
runs between the facing rooftops;
the stars’ tired eyes shed tears of light;
blue dreams of transmigration exalt me.
below all that, what portals! what streets!
i hear, in the dark, a screw hit the ground,
the clacking of shutters, the jangle of locks;
and the bloodshot eyes of a buggy scare me.
i follow, like lines on a music stave,
the stately double row of façades
while pastoral notes from a distant flute
trill, in the silence, a gloomy warning.
oh, if i’d never die! if forever
i’d seek and attain the perfection of things!
i lose myself envisioning wives
who chastely nest in clear-glass mansions!
dear sons! what swift dreams, alighting,
will bring sharp clarity to your lives!
i want the mothers and sisters you love
to live in luminous, fragile homes.
ah! like our grandfathers’ fleets, like fervent
nomads, like the ruddy race to come, (5)
we’ll go and explore every continent
and sail across the watery expanses!
but how, if we live enclosed by stone
in a dark and treeless valley of walls?
i think i see knives flash in the shadows
and hear a strangled cry for help.
and along these murky corridors
the taverns, if i peer in, appall me.
some sorry drunks are staggering home
and sing, arms joined, for old time’s sake.
but i’m not afraid of being robbed;
the dubious characters fall behind me.
the scrawny and mangy dogs don’t bark;
they look a little like yellowish wolves.
and those keepers of keys, the night watchmen,
scan with their lanterns each entryway;
above them loose women, in scanty robes,
smoke and cough at the balcony windows.
and looming out of that jagged mass
of tomblike buildings tall as hills,
human pain, like a baleful sea,
seeks vast horizons for its bitter tides!",pt_XX,en_XX,"the sentiment of a westerner

hail marys
in our streets, at nightfall,
there is such gloom, there is such melancholy,
that the shadows, the hustle and bustle, the tejo river, the sea breeze
awaken in me an absurd desire to suffer.
the sky seems low and misty,
the escaped gas nauseates me, disturbs me;
and the buildings, with their chimneys, and the crowd
are covered in a monotonous and londonish color.
rental cars honk in the distance,
taking those who leave to the railway. happy!
exhibitions, countries come to my mind:
madrid, paris, berlin, st. petersburg, the world!
the buildings, made only of wood,
resemble cages with aviaries:
like bats, at the tolling of the bells,
the master carpenters jump from beam to beam.
the caulkers return in groups,
with their jackets on their shoulders, sooty and dry;
lost in thought, I wander through alleyways and lanes,
or I wander through the docks where boats dock.
and then I evoke nautical chronicles:
moors, galleys, heroes, all resurrected!
camões fights in the south, saving a book by swimming!
proud ships sail that I will never see!
and the end of the afternoon inspires me; and disturbs me!
from a british battleship, rowboats sail;
and on land, in a clinking of dishes and cutlery,
some trendy hotels glow at dinner.
in a cab, two dentists argue;
a limping harlequin flails on stilts;
the cherubs of the home float on the balconies;
at the doorways, shopkeepers grow weary in their hair!
the arsenals and workshops empty out;
the river glistens, viscous, the workers hurry;
and in a black school, herculean and playful,
the fishwives, running firmly, appear.
they shake their opulent hips!
their manly trunks remind me of pillars;
and some, balancing baskets on their heads,
carry children who later perish in storms.
barefoot! unloading coal,
from morning to night, aboard the frigates;
they crowd in a neighborhood where cats meow,
and rotten fish breeds infection!
ii
closed night
knocking on bars in the prisons. a sound
that torments and leaves some gentle madness!
the prison, where today old women and children are,
rarely holds a woman of ""dom""!
and I even suspect an aneurysm
so morbidly I feel, at the lighting of the lights;
at the sight of prisons, the old cathedral, the crosses,
my heart weeps, filling and sinking.
at intervals, the floors light up,
and the taverns, cafes, shops, tobacco shops
spread their white reflections like a sheet;
and the moon reminds me of the circus and juggling games.
two churches, in a nostalgic square,
cast the black and funereal stain of the clergy:
in them, a severe inquisitorial hermit smokes,
as soon as I venture into and expand on history.
in the part that collapsed in the earthquake,
straight, equal, tall buildings wall me in;
the steep climbs confront me in the rest,
and the bells of a monastic and devout tolling.
but in a public and ordinary square,
with benches for courting and small pepper trees,
bronze, monumental, of warlike proportions,
an epic figure once ascends on a pillar!
and I dream of cholera, I imagine fever,
in this accumulation of emaciated bodies;
shadowy and spectral, soldiers gather;
a palace ignites in front of a hovel.
cavalry patrols depart
from the arches of the former barracks turned convents;
middle ages! some on foot, others at a slow pace,
spread throughout the cooling capital.
sad city! I fear that you will rekindle
a dead passion in me! the distant streetlights,
grieving, illuminating, your elegant ones,
bent over, smiling at the jewelers' windows.
and more: seamstresses, florists
descend from the department stores, startling me;
they struggle to lift their high necks
and many of them are actresses or chorus girls.
and I, with a single-lens opera glass,
always find subjects for rebellious paintings:
I enter the brasserie; at the tables of emigrants,
dominoes are played amid laughter and harsh light.
iii
by gaslight
and I go out. the night is heavy, oppressive. on
the stone sidewalks the impure ones drag themselves.
oh soft hospitals! from the doorways
a breath that sends shivers down almost bare shoulders.
the shops surround me, warm. I think
I see side altars, rows of chapels,
with saints and faithful, floats, branches, candles,
in a cathedral of immense length.
the bourgeois girls of catholicism
slide on the floor mined by the pipes;
and they remind me, as they cry sickly to the sound of pianos,
of the nuns who died of hysteria from fasting.
in a cutlery shop, a blacksmith, wearing an apron, works the hammer, with a red glow;
and from a bakery, still warm,
a healthy and honest smell of bread wafts out.
and while I contemplate a book that may exacerbate,
I wish reality and analysis would give it to me;
houses of fashion and trends shine;
a young pickpocket looks through the shop windows.
long descents! not being able to paint
with masterful, healthy and sincere verses,
the slender diffusion of your reflections,
and your romantic and lunar pallor!
what a great snake, the lustful person,
choosing shawls with elaborate patterns, restrained;
their excellence attracts, magnetic, among luxury,
that piles up along the mahogany counters.
and that old woman, with her hair in bandeaus! sometimes,
her train mimics an ancient open fan,
with two-tone vertical bars. nearby,
her mecklenburgers scratch victoriously.
foreign fabrics are unfolded;
ornamental plants dry on the shelves;
powder flakes of rice flutter suffocatingly,
and in clouds of satin the shop assistants sway.
but everything tires! the candelabras are extinguished on the street fronts,
like stars, little by little;
a hoarse street hawker chirps in the solitude;
the dazzling frames become mausoleums.
""pity for misery!... compassion for me!...""
and on the corners, bald, eternal, restless,
an old man, my latin teacher in the school days,
asks me for alms!
iv
dead hours
the deep ceiling of oxygen, of air,
stretches lengthwise, in the middle of the attics;
tears of light from the stars with dark circles come;
I am enraptured by the blue chimera of transmigration.
below, what gates! what streets!
a screw falls on the stones, in the darkness:
fences are put up, locks creak,
and the eyes of a carriage driver startle me, bloodshot.
and I follow, like the lines of a musical staff,
the double august flow of the facades;

quem quer que lhe tivesse concebido os ossos, era então visível o objectivo de os fazer florir. deles brotaria a pele, o céu, a encenação da glória. tudo isso mais não eram, entretanto, do que imagens em apuros, imagens atacadas por memórias em conflito com o presente, ou mesmo com o passado onde pareciam radicar, e que, esbeiçando-se nos bordos, davam lugar a que o esquecimento sobre elas actuasse como uma espécie de ácido sulfúrico.
de cada vez que o invadia, a enxurrada da memória ascendia-lhe assim a um tal nível da consciência que os seus próprios ossos, deixando de ser pontos fixos e estáveis aos quais ele se pudesse segurar, vinham, desmantelados, boiar à superfície das águas borrascosas, de mistura

dos lados de grijó em lassa caravana.
debaixo da carroça trota a coelheira,
aproveitando a sombra débil e ambulante.
sentado na boleia, as rédeas na mão morena
descuidadas, um homem cisma, confia
do caminho ao macho lento a decisão.
outros homens a pé e mulheres novas
entretêm de riso a caminhada espessa.
logo após, sobre os burros, os pertences.
alguns velhos também, já cansados de tudo,
tiram partido do precário trote. as crianças
de peito sugam em sonolenta teima
as elásticas tetas sacudidas, mas alvas e redondas.

em pequenas e lúdicas manadas, dando
às hortas laterais breves saltos furtivos.

levanta para mim doces olhos castanhos.
dizem que vêm
da europa central, de uma raça sem chão,
e aqui procura, de insultos rodeada,
cumprir a sua luta, seu degredo
e sua primitiva vocação.
dizem que os ciganos desenterram animais defuntos
de alguma enfermidade menos limpa
e neles cravam dentes de fome milenária.
dizem que as mulheres estão na intimidade
das estrelas e a troco de uns mil-réis
lêem nas mãos destinos coloridos.
dizem que roubam quintais e assaltam capoeiras,
e os aldeões, em pânico secreto,
os expulsam com voz impiedosa e decidida mão
das cercanias do seu chão governado.
dizem que enganam os incautos campónios
em negócios sempre escuros de animais,
em que fazem passar por uma estampa
o mais escalavrado e cego dos cavalos.
dizem que na vila, ao desfazer das feiras,
têm por costume, depois de embriagados,

para falarmos do meio de obter o poema,
a retórica não serve. trata-se de uma coisa simples, que não
precisa de requintes nem de fórmulas. apanha-se
uma flor, por exemplo, mas que não seja dessas flores que crescem
no meio do campo, nem das que se vendem nas lojas
ou nos mercados. é uma flor de sílabas, em que as
pétalas são as vogais, e o caule uma consoante. põe-se
no jarro da estrofe, e deixa-se estar. para que não morra,
basta um pedaço de primavera na água, que se vai
buscar à imaginação, quando está um dia de chuva,
ou se faz entrar pela janela, quando o ar fresco
da manhã enche o quarto de azul. então,
a flor confunde-se com o poema, mas ainda não é
o poema. para que ele nasça, a flor precisa
de encontrar cores mais naturais do que essas
que a natureza lhe deu. podem ser as cores do teu
rosto – a sua brancura, quando o sol vem ter contigo,
ou o fundo dos teus olhos em que todas as cores
da vida se confundem, com o brilho da vida. depois,
deito essas cores sobre a corola, e vejo-as descerem
para as folhas, como a seiva que corre pelos
veios invisíveis da alma. posso, então, colher a flor,

me deste.","how to make a poem

in the middle of fields, nor the ones they sell in stores,
or in the markets. a flower of syllables rather, in which the
petals are vowels, and the stem is the consonant. place it
in the vase of the stanza, and let it be. so that it doesn’t die,
it’s enough to put a little spring in the water, which,
on a rainy day, is fetched from the imagination,
or is pushed in through the window when the cool air
of morning fills the blue room. this is when
the flower begins to seem like a poem, but it’s still not
the poem. for it to really sprout, the flower needs
to find more natural colors than those
which nature gave it. they might be the colors
of your complexion – its whiteness, when the sun falls on you,
or the depths of your eyes in which all the colors
of life mix with the sheen of life. after that,
i pour these colors over the corolla, and watch them descend

we go dancing, whereas i naturally hated
the scuzziness of discotheques, preferring
the descriptive movement of novels

the tension between us increased over time,
with things going downhill when she started
inviting other people into our bed. until
one day she arrived home and introduced me to
“the love of our life; now we’re a threesome”.
and so my shadow, that ingrate,
began saying the most atrocious things.
such as: “you go to the movies. we’re staying home.”
or: “we could walk separately now and then,
don’t you think?” and she shuts herself up in the bedroom
for impassioned (breathless) conversations with the other.
at which point i leave the house in a huff.

shared by two. now there’s a millimeter of distance between me
and my shadow. enough of an interval for a ray of light.

I can turn the page and declare that, in truth,
I was never alone. I always had the good company

Like all couples. We had (and have)
the same age, the same musical tastes,
a parallel love for firewood,

It was she who sometimes insisted,
we go dancing. But I, of course, detested
the quagmire of nightclubs; I loved more quickly
the descriptive movement of novels
than the mortgaged light of a distant body.
Over time, however, this dispute grew.
Our relationship lost its importance
as she invited more people
to our bed. Until one day she came home
and introduced me to ""the love of our life; now
we are three."" And so my shadow,
my ungrateful one, began to say hurtful things.
For example: ""You go to the movies. We'll stay.""
Or else: ""We might as well, from time to time,
walk separately, don't you think?"" And she closes
herself in the room with the other, in breathless colloquies.
At that point, in anger, I storm out the door.

of two. There's now a millimeter of distance between me

his small and humble fantasy
in anything greater than simply leading
his cattle to drink from the cold spring
and drawing their milk so that he can drink!
however fortune may stir things up,
he’ll never feel any greater grief
than the weight of knowing his life is brief.

that, due to a grave infirmity,
he lost his senses for a long season,
during which time, bereft of reason,
he claimed and believed that all the ships
which at the port of piraeus landed
were ships he owned if not commanded.
he took himself for a mighty lord
and enjoyed as well a happy life,
since he lost nothing when ships were lost,
and rejoiced for those that landed safely.
time went by till one day crito
his brother returned after a long absence
and, seeing how thrasyllus had lost his wits,
was moved by fraternal love to pity.
he gave him to doctors, charging them
to perform the cure thus far refused.
alas! by restoring his brother’s senses,
he robbed him of his sweet easy life!
the herbs of apollo, without delay,
gave him back his former health.
now of sound mind, thrasyllus thanked
his brother for caring, not for his act.
for when he saw himself in danger
of the toils that sanity would impose
and saw no more that state of privilege
conferred on him by his fantasy,
he sighed: “o enemy brother, pretended
friend, why did you take from me
that life so calm and free of pains,
which can’t be had by anyone sane?
“what king, or duke or mighty lord
would i have wished to trade places with?
what did i care if the world ended
or if nature’s order suddenly changed?
now dear life is a heavy burden,
for i know what toil and sadness are.
restore me to that state of bliss;
the only sane condition is madness.”",pt_XX,en_XX,"On the Disarray of the World (excerpt)
If someone had such low imagination
To never concern themselves with greater things
But to lead their cattle to the cold spring
And milk them for the milk they would drink!
How blessed they would be!
For, no matter how fortune turned,
They would never feel greater sorrow
Than regretting that life is short.
They would see the sun's purple face rise,
They would see the clear spring always flow,
Without imagining the water's source,
Nor who hides the light on the horizon.
Playing the flute where the cattle graze,
They would know the herbs of the high mountain;
They would believe in God, simple and quiet,
Without speculating on any secrets.
There is a tale of a certain Trasilau,
Among the things of ancient times,
Who lost his mind for a long time
Due to a great illness;
And while he was out of his mind,
He stubbornly believed it to be true,
That the ships that sailed
Were his own, as many as anchored in the Pyrean port.
He would have been a lord very great
(Besides the joyful life he led),
For in those that were lost he lost nothing,
And he rejoiced in those that arrived safely.
Not long after, one day,
A Crito, his brother who had been away,
Returned to land; and seeing his lost brother,
He was moved by fraternal love.
He handed him over to the doctors, and with advice
Made him undergo the refused cure.
Sad, because to restore his dear mind
He took away his peaceful, carefree life!
The Apollonian herbs, suddenly,
Restored him to his former health.
Trasilau, now wise, thanked his dear brother
For the intention, not the action.
Because, after facing the danger
Of the troubles that his mind required,
And after not seeing the old state
That vain opinion presented to him,
""O enemy brother, with a friend's heart!
Why did you take me away?"" he sighed,
""From the most peaceful life, free in all things,
That no wise man could ever have?
Why did you exchange me for a king, for a duke?
For a lord of great strength?
What good did it do me that the world had ended,
Or that order had changed nature?
Now life is burdensome to me;
I know what toil and sorrow are.
Return me to my former state, for I warn you
That wisdom lies only in folly.""",0

covering it, itself, and its symbols.
today is the day when night becomes day,
when language celebrates the animals
after the animals have perished,
but without memory of it,
nor nostalgia for it. just language,
just meaning and sound resonating
within meaning, without the hypothesis of a beginning
imposing itself, without the hypothesis of an end imposing itself.

do alto das muralhas de ohrid onde
acorrera aos gritos desvairados dos vigias,
o rei samuel avistou o seu exército desfigurado,
arrastando-se entre as montanhas da macedónia.
aos catorze mil homens tinham sido
arrancados os olhos por ordem do imperador
e a um em cada cem mandara ele, basílio ii,

tropeçando, agarrados uns aos outros,
a tortura espelhada nas contorções das faces,
o sangue a empapar-lhes os andrajos. e o rei,

"um cão para pompeia
aos amantes enlaçados contraponho
um cão de pompeia, decerto ele andaria
a brincar junto ao forum, à cata de algum osso,
quando o vesúvio o caçou, mais lesto,
para moldá-lo em pedra-pomes.
insisto em vê-lo como um bicho magro e descuidado,
de penúria diuturna. passou de leve
pelos peristilos, alheio ao luxo, à corrupção,
à astrologia, e nunca dos triclínios
lhe caiu um naco envenenado, nunca se tornou
nem animal simbólico, nem mito que ganisse.
nunca foi encontrado nas escavações, mas é para aqui chamado.
era um cão, just a dog, com pulgas e
que alçava a perna como todos os cães
e ladrava e mordia quando era preciso.
fazia pela vida e, fauno das esquinas, pelas cadelas no cio.
alguma tabuleta diria cave canem em tésseras minúsculas,
sem alaridos da história, e só sobreviveu
nos livros de latim expurgados, misturada
com a guerra das gálias e alguns nomes de deuses.
eu canto um cão sem fábula nem pedigree, que não fugiu aos fados,
um rafeiro vulgar, digamos, de plínio
o velho que, a propósito, morreu perto dali,
talvez uivando, uns dias depois dele.
“você é um cerebral”, disse-me cloé, flava e enervada.
“sim”, disse-lhe eu com prudência, “mas há tantos.
e o amor e a morte sempre foram pensáveis”.
e acrescentei “e depois? que mal faz isso ao cão?”","a dog for pompei
rather than a pair of embracing lovers i propose
a dog from pompei. one that was no doubt
frolicking next to the forum, in search of a bone,
when friskier vesuvius caught and molded him
into pumice-stone. i insist
on seeing him as a scrawny, neglected creature
for whom poverty was a way of life. he skipped
through peristyles, a stranger to luxury, to corruption
to astrology, and no poisoned morsel ever befell him
from the triclinia, he never became
a symbolic animal or barking myth.
he was never found in any excavation, but we summon him now.
he was just a dog, un chien, who had fleas and
raised his paw like all dogs
and yelped and bit when necessary.
he lived for today and, faun of street corners, for bitches in heat.
a sign no doubt read cave canem in tiny tesserae,
making no mark in history, surviving only
in expurgated books in latin, mixed up
with the gallic wars and a few names of gods.
i sing of a dog without fable or pedigree, who didn’t escape fate,
an ordinary mutt belonging, let’s say, to pliny
the elder, who happens to have died nearby,
perhaps screaming, a few days later.
“you’re so cerebral,” said vexed and golden-haired chloe.
“yes,” i replied cautiously, “but so are a lot of other people.
and love and death have always been ponderable.”
“besides,” i added, “what harm does it do the dog?”",pt_XX,en_XX,"a dog for pompeii
to the entwined lovers I contrast
a dog from pompeii, surely he would walk
playing near the forum, in search of some bone,
when vesuvius hunted him, swifter,
to shape him into pumice stone.
I insist on seeing him as a thin and careless creature,
in perpetual need. he passed lightly
through the peristyles, oblivious to luxury, corruption,
astrology, and never from the tricliniums
did a poisoned piece fall on him, he never became
neither a symbolic animal, nor a whining myth.
he was never found in the excavations, but he is called here.
he was a dog, just a dog, with fleas and
who lifted his leg like all dogs
and barked and bit when necessary.
he made his way in life and, a faun of the corners, for the females in heat.
some tablet would say cave canem in tiny tesserae,
without the clamor of history, and he only survived
in the expunged Latin books, mixed
with the war of the gauls and some names of gods.
I sing a dog without fable or pedigree, who did not escape fate,
a common mongrel, let's say, of pliny
the elder who, by the way, died nearby,
perhaps howling, a few days after him.
""You are a cerebral,"" cloe said to me, flava and annoyed.
""yes,"" I said to her cautiously, ""but there are so many.
and love and death have always been conceivable"".

"para a educação sentimental
tantas vezes se vive de uma arrebatada
noção dos contrastes mais fortes entre o bem e o
mal, entre a grandeza e a abjecção, entre as rápidas
peripécias de um heroísmo ansioso e o destino inexorável,
que o melodrama é da nossa mais funda natureza,
nostálgica, obscuramente nostálgica do coração radical,
do que vai à desfilada nos sonhos contraditórios,
do que engendra imagens capciosas e julga viver em liberdade,
mas é só imprudente e explosivo, mas esbarra
nas malhas deste mundo, nos imprevistos
da traição e da morte, ou tem de renunciar perante os rasgos
mais sublimes. a paixão dilacera bruscamente as personagens
apegadas à felicidade, os obstáculos
também têm protagonistas, ajustes de contas, cruéis fulgores,
perseguições, e nos casos desvairados de amor não há saída.
desse falhanço insuportável nasce o melodrama,
lírico, incontido, entre golfadas de espiral vertiginosa
com o sangue e a memória, com o que não tem remédio e a música trágica,
em que alguém vai morrer, alguém se perde alucinado,
e alguém se salva e porventura alguém escreve
a história e alguém lhe junta a música

melodrama being part of our deepest nature,

which races at top speed in contradictory dreams,
which engenders seductive images and thinks it lives in freedom,
but it’s merely reckless and explosive, it stumbles
into the world’s snares, into unexpected
treachery and death, or it must renounce in the face of the most
sublime flashes. passion rudely lacerates people
attached to happiness. the obstacles we meet
also have protagonists, scores to settle, cruel splendors,
feverish pursuits. and in desperate cases of love there’s no way out.
from that unbearable failure is born lyrical, unbridled
melodrama, amid whirling, dizzying spurts
of blood and memory, of dashed hopes and tragic music,
in which someone dies, someone goes mad,
and someone is saved, and maybe someone writes down
the story, and someone else adds music

and facile, and someone desires this, it makes someone feel a shiver
of tingling banality, a voracious and unconfessed thrill.",pt_XX,en_XX,"for sentimental education

chamar mas de uma certa maneira
talvez um apelo ou uma presença ou um sofrimento
ora eu que no fundo
apesar das muitas palavras vindas nas muitas páginas dos dicionários
bem vistas as coisas disponho somente de duas palavras
desde a primeira manhã do mundo
para nomear só duas coisas
apenas preciso de as atribuir
não sei se gosto mais do mar
se gosto mais da mulher
sei que gosto do mar sei que gosto da mulher
e quando digo o mar a mulher
não digo mar ou mulher só por dizer

e um prazer em o dizer
um gosto afinal em gostar

o mar rebenta em ondas espraiadas nos compridos cabelos da mulher
que ela faz ondular melhor de tarde em tarde
no mês de setembro nas marés vivas
o melhor da mulher talvez o olhar
é para mim o mar da mulher
e à mulher que um só dia encontro na vida
de passagem um simples momento num sítio qualquer
talvez a muitos quilómetros do mar
mas mulher que não mais consigo esquecer
mesmo imerso na dor ou submerso em cuidados
a essa mulher qualquer
eu chamo mulher do mar
nos fins de setembro quando eu partir
de uma cidade seja ela qual for
quando eu pressentir que alguém morre
que alguma coisa fica para sempre nos dias
e ou nuns olhos ou numa água
num pouco de água ou em muita água
onda do mar lágrima ou brilho do olhar
eu recear seriamente vir-me a submergir
direi alto ou baixo conforme puder
com a boca toda ou já a custar-me a engolir

there’s ocean there’s woman
and both of them reach me in amiable bays

i hear them call but not just any old way
they call in a particular manner
perhaps as a petition or a presence or a suffering
the fact is that basically
and despite all the words in all the pages of dictionaries
i really only have since the world’s first morning
two words at my disposal
to name just two things
whatever two i choose
i’m not sure which i like more

which seem to me to clearly show that ocean and woman
as i say ocean as i say woman

but are perhaps a way of liking

and a pleasure in saying so

and obey the sense of sound
there are waves in the ocean
the ocean breaks in waves that spread in the woman’s long hair
and she makes it wave better now and then
in the month of september when the tide is highest
probably the best part of woman namely her gaze
is for me the woman’s ocean
and the woman i meet only once in life
crossing her path for just a moment wherever it may be
perhaps many miles from the ocean
but a woman i can’t ever forget
no matter how awash i am in sorrows or worries
is the woman whatever woman
i call the woman from the ocean
in that late september when i depart
from a city whatever city
when i can feel that someone is dying
that something lingers forever in the days
and i sincerely fear i might sink
into some eyes or into water
into a little or a lot of water
an ocean wave a tear or a glassy gaze
i’ll say loudly or softly however i’m able
with wide-open mouth or already choking

for me the woman's sea

briefly a simple moment in any place
perhaps many kilometers from the sea
but a woman that I can never forget
even immersed in pain or submerged in care

I call woman of the sea

from a city whatever it may be

that something remains forever in the days

enquanto rebentam as ondas junto às praias,

num espaço inviolável,
guardado pelas asas da musa e os provérbios da sibila
como o actor recolhido aos bastidores do teatro.
esquecidos os sonhos da cabeça adornada por folhas de louro
ou os canapés onde se alongam as últimas almas epicuristas,
num sossego adverbial, em que nada mais ouvisse,

com a leveza que deixa a pluma ao roçar o papel.

cada palavra tivesse a autoridade da grinalda
ou do selo real
e estreitasse numa sebe o mundo que conheceu,
enquanto tudo se gentiliza e desmorona à sua volta.

do prisioneiro na parede da cela, contando os dias,

forgetting the dream of a laurel-crowned head
and the couches that cradle the last epicurean souls,
he longs only for adverbial quiet – not a sound –
in which all might be preserved, in the ambit of his art,
with the lightness of a quill passing over paper.
that each word, purified, rolling on the tongue
like a host, might have the authority of a garland
or royal seal
and press the world he knew into a hedge
as everything degenerates and collapses around him.

cuts in the wall of his cell to count the days,
knowing what will come: the slipknot of the gallows

vê-lo desde o rumor e as casas da cidade
até uma vaga promessa de rio
e a pequenina vida que se concede às unhas
mais triste é termos de nascer e morrer
e haver árvores ao fim da rua
é triste ir pela vida como quem
regressa e entrar humildemente por engano pela morte dentro
é triste no outono concluir
que era o verão a única estação
passou o solidário vento e não o conhecemos
e não soubemos ir até ao fundo da verdura
como rios que sabem onde encontrar o mar
e com que pontes com que ruas com que gentes com que montes conviver
através de palavras de uma água para sempre dita
mas o mais triste é recordar os gestos de amanhã
triste é comprar castanhas depois da tourada
entre o fumo e o domingo na tarde de novembro
e ter como futuro o asfalto e muita gente
e atrás a vida sem nenhuma infância
revendo tudo isto algum tempo depois
a tarde morre pelos dias fora
é muito triste andar por entre deus ausente
mas, ó poeta, administra a tristeza sabiamente","hand to the plow
happy the man who manages sadness wisely
and learns to divide it among the days
though months and years pass it will never leave him
how sad it is to grow old on the doorstep
while weaving in our hands a belated heart
how sad to risk against human returns
the blue equilibrium of summer’s sheer mornings
by the ocean that overflows with us
in the long farewell of our condition
it is sad to see in the garden the sun’s solitude
reaching from the city’s houses and din
to a distant hint of river
and the meager life meted out to us
it is sadder to have to be born and to die
and to have trees at the end of the street
it is sad to go through life as if
returning and to enter humbly into death by mistake
it is sad in autumn to conclude that summer
was the only season
the wind passed by in solidarity and we didn’t see it
and we didn’t know to go to the green depths
like rivers that know where to find the sea
and know which bridges which streets which people which hills to talk with
through the words of a forever uttered water
but what’s saddest is to remember tomorrow’s acts
it is sad to buy chestnuts after the bullfight
between sunday and the smoke on a november afternoon
and to have asphalt and many people for your future
and behind you a life with no childhood
looking back at all of this some time later
day by day the afternoon dies
it is very sad to walk among god and be absent
but manage, poet, your sadness wisely",pt_XX,en_XX,"The hand on the plow

sadness and learns to share it through the days

weaving a late heart in the hands

the blue balance of the extreme summer mornings
along the overflowing sea of us
in the long farewell of our condition
it is sad in the garden the loneliness of the sun
to see it from the noise and the city houses
to a vague promise of a river
and the tiny life that is granted to the nails
sadder is to have to be born and die
and have trees at the end of the street
it is sad to go through life as someone
returns and humbly enters mistakenly through death

that summer was the only season

and we did not know how to go to the depth of the greenery

renasce neste largo a minha infância

e jorra de repente com o ímpeto do início

que provisoriamente sinto de voltar alguns anos atrás

de ser um espectador de sucessivos sucedidos dias
de não viver apenas não viver sem sequer saber que vivo

inacessíveis sempre como um absoluto
sempre impossível tido no entanto por possível

sensível dia a dia nos meus dedos
e um dia susceptível de me encher a boca para sempre

o que perdi. sou de uma adulta idade

evidently were because they simply were

with my father a beer that resisted
the heat of the summer day

for many years now chewing wine and bread and life
the taste of women the taste of girls
forever inaccessible like any absolute
forever impossible yet pursued as if possible

earth day by day running through my fingers
and one day bound to fill my mouth forever

is what i lost. i’m a grown-up now.

o mal estar de uma efervescência de ruínas, das folhas

“ – procura no coro dos mortos o primeiro grau
da felicidade; na obsessão dos pescadores de ostras
um derradeiro uivo de sofrimento . . . ” e as palavras chegavam-me
em tumulto, numa pesada respiração, num estertor
de velho. então, vi o fim: a queda sinuosa dos astros, o rosto
de um gelo azul, o ruído de ondas sobrepondo-se à imagem
do ventre rasgado até às entranhas. nenhum exorcismo me restituiu
a força. entrei na procissão dos sonâmbulos,
juntando a voz ao gemido comum. “ – quem é este?” –
“ – o taciturno poeta, o antigo portador de absolvição.”

of nostalgias. i was told:
“seek the first degree of happiness in the chorus
of the dead, a final howl of suffering in the obsessiveness
of oystermen . . . ”, and the words came to me
in a tumult, in heavy breaths, in a death rattle
of the aged. and i saw the end: the spiraling fall of the stars, the face
of a blue ice, the sound of waves drowning out the image
of a belly rent to the entrails. no exorcism could restore
my strength. i entered the procession of the sleepwalkers,
uniting my voice to the common lament. “who is this?”

I experience a contact of shadows,
the discomfort of an effervescence of ruins, of leaves
taking on the virgin form of a trunk. I am already a habit,
inhabited by different directions of spirit, heard in the depths of human wells: a tone of voice that multiplies the gasping contradiction
of nostalgias. they told me:
"" - seek in the chorus of the dead the first degree
of happiness; in the obsession of oyster fishermen
a final howl of suffering . . . "" and the words came to me
in turmoil, in heavy breathing, in the gasp
of the old. then, I saw the end: the sinuous fall of the stars, the face
of a blue ice, the noise of waves overlaying the image
of the belly torn to the entrails. no exorcism restored me
the strength. I entered the procession of sleepwalkers,
joining my voice to the common moan. "" - who is this?"" -
"" - the taciturn poet, the ancient bearer of absolution.""

de vidros partidos para a auto-estrada. nem vento,
nem mar: só o ruído dos carros entrava pelas fendas
para ecoar no tecto (madeiras à vista entre os restos
de estuque). depois, na rua, pendurou-se nos ferros podres
de antigas varandas. percebia-se, por entre os arbustos
que invadiam tudo, uma vista que teria sido digna
de um quadro romântico. o vale, coberto de casas, e
os montes invadidos por ferro-velho, ocultam um passado
de rebanhos e pastores. mas talvez não se tenha ouvido aqui
a música da flauta. com efeito, esta casa limita-se
a guardar antigos silêncios, que o uso transformou em manchas

e só abrigam tocas répteis, que apenas se adivinham,
no inverno, escondidos do universo. mas alguém passou por aqui,

of decrepit balconies. he discerned, through the underbrush
that was overrunning everything, a landscape worthy
of a romantic painting. the houses covering the valley and
the hills taken over by scrap iron hide a past
with flocks and shepherds. but perhaps the flute’s song
was never heard here. indeed, this house conserves nothing

"receita para fazer azul
se quiseres fazer azul,
pega num pedaço de céu e mete-o numa panela grande,
que possas levar ao lume do horizonte;
depois mexe o azul com um resto de vermelho
da madrugada, até que ele se desfaça;
despeja tudo num bacio bem limpo,
para que nada reste das impurezas da tarde.
por fim, peneira um resto de ouro da areia
do meio-dia, até que a cor pegue ao fundo de metal.
se quiseres, para que as cores se não desprendam
com o tempo, deita no líquido um caroço de pêssego queimado.
vê-lo-ás desfazer-se, sem deixar sinais de que alguma vez
ali o puseste; e nem o negro da cinza deixará um resto de ocre
na superfície dourada. podes, então, levantar a cor
até à altura dos olhos, e compará-la com o azul autêntico.
ambas as cores te parecerão semelhantes, sem que
possas distinguir entre uma e outra.
assim o fiz – eu, abraão ben judá ibn haim,
iluminador de loulé – e deixei a receita a quem quiser,
algum dia, imitar o céu.","recipe for making the colour blue
if you wish to make the colour blue
take a piece of sky and put it in a pot
large enough to place on the flame of the horizon.
stir into the blue a pinch of early morning red
until it dissolves. pour everything
into a brass bowl that has been well washed
to eliminate all of the afternoon’s impurities.
finally, sift in a few smidgens of gold from the sand
of midday until the colour adheres to the bottom of the bowl.
to prevent the colours from separating with time,
drop a charred peach pit into the liquid.
it will disintegrate, leaving no telltale
sign, not even – from the black ash – an ochre trace
on the golden surface. you may then raise the colour
to eye level and compare it with genuine blue.
the two colours will look so alike
that you cannot distinguish one from the other.
this was how i did it – i, abraham ben judah ibn haim,
illuminator from the town of loulé. and i left the recipe
for whoever, one day, would imitate the sky.",pt_XX,en_XX,"Recipe to make blue
If you want to make blue,
take a piece of sky and put it in a large pot,
that you can bring to the fire of the horizon;
then mix the blue with a touch of red

pour everything into a clean basin,
so that no impurities from the afternoon remain.
finally, sift a touch of gold from the sand
of noon, until the color sticks to the bottom of the metal.
if you wish, so that the colors do not fade
over time, add a burned peach pit to the liquid.
you will see it dissolve, leaving no signs that you ever
placed it there; and not even the black of the ash will leave a trace of ochre
on the golden surface. you can then lift the color
to eye level, and compare it to the authentic blue.
both colors will seem similar to you, without
being able to distinguish between one and the other.

"acordar na rua do mundo
madrugada. passos soltos de gente que saiu
com destino certo e sem destino aos tombos
no meu quarto cai o som depois
a luz. ninguém sabe o que vai
por esse mundo. que dia é hoje?
soa o sino sólido as horas. os pombos
alisam as penas. no meu quarto cai o pó.
um cano rebentou junto ao passeio.
um pombo morto foi na enxurrada
junto com as folhas dum jornal já lido.
impera o declive

no ovo do sono a nossa gema.

abanam os prédios. pombos debicam
o azul dos azulejos. assoma à janela

desavém-se. não veio via satélite a querida imagem o vídeo
não gravou

de um vaso salpicando o fato do bancário","waking up on the street of the world

the light. no one knows what goes on

smooth their feathers. the dust falls in my room.

our yolk in the egg of sleep.

fan the buildings. pigeons peck

nem todas as coisas marcam para nós

ó tanque que conténs a história do tempo,
hora a hora nas quatro estações.
tens o inverno, o verão, a primavera
e sobretudo o outono perfeito, tão imóvel.

como te lançam as pétalas soltas
para que o arquétipo tombe sobre a imagem.

visitam o teu espelho, ó tanque antigo,
como os peixes, as aves e os insectos
passam, no inteiro tempo em que tu guardas
os sinais do passado e do presente.

que passamos, só esta água
parada no seu círculo e a escorrer
tem uma força móvel e imóvel
que me puxa de idade para idade.

rasa ao chão, espalhada nos terrenos.
