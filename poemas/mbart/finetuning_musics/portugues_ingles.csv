"o sonho da linguagem
escreverás sobre a sujeição dos animais.
mas não hoje. lembra-te de como se move
a pantera, ainda, na jaula sem literatura
que lhe legaram. lembrar-te-ás. mas não hoje.
porque hoje é o dia em que as metáforas
despertam, a arca se abre, e a linguagem
se assemelha a uma invenção em aberto.
uma vigília de metáforas preenchendo a noite,
como um fogo-de-santelmo que, eternamente,
a cobrisse, a si e ao seu manto e aos seus símbolos.
hoje é o dia em que a noite se faz dia,
em que a linguagem celebra os animais
depois dos animais terem perecido,
mas sem que haja memória disso,
sequer nostalgia disso. apenas linguagem,
apenas sentido e som a ressoar dentro
do sentido, sem que a hipótese de um princípio
se imponha, sem que a hipótese de um fim se imponha.
haverás de despertar, tu também,
para a vigília das metáforas,
para o sonho da linguagem.","the dream of language

still moves in the literature-free cage
it inherited. you’ll remember. but not today.
because today’s the day when metaphors
awaken, the chest opens up, and language
resembles an invention in progress.
a vigil of metaphors filling up the night,
as if it and its mantle and its symbols
were covered by an eternal saint elmo’s fire.
today’s the day when night becomes day,
when language celebrates animals
after the animals have perished
but with no trace of them surviving
in memory or in longing. just language,
just meaning and sound echoing inside

asserting itself, no possibility of an end.

to the vigil of metaphors,
to the dream of language.",pt_XX,en_XX,"the dream of language

like flannel sewn onto the denim of the heights
it nurtured hoarded hurt

aterrador.","the strewn body
his body was getting lost in the desert, which kept gaining more ground and redefining its borders inside him, causing his organs, isolated by the surrounding sands, to reverberate in a strange new way. day by day he was getting more strewn out. the various parts of what could only abstractly be conceived as a whole were beginning to spread apart, such that the ocean tides were soon foaming between them, and the milky way itself started cutting through. his flesh, in fact, exerted an enigmatic attraction on the stars, which in due course it managed to assimilate, exhibiting them (to the unknowing) as so many luminous scars whose glow, transformed into blood, slowly dwindled. on these occasions he was no more than an ember among the ashes, though one could still make out the faint throbbing of his guts, apt to be quickened by the slightest change in the wind’s direction. so he decided on a plastic-coated self. he began with his extremities, his fingers and feet, but soon he was meticulously wrapping his lungs, intestines and heart in cellophane, against which the waves made a frightful sound.",pt_XX,en_XX,"the spaced body

"para a educação sentimental
tantas vezes se vive de uma arrebatada
noção dos contrastes mais fortes entre o bem e o
mal, entre a grandeza e a abjecção, entre as rápidas
peripécias de um heroísmo ansioso e o destino inexorável,
que o melodrama é da nossa mais funda natureza,
nostálgica, obscuramente nostálgica do coração radical,
do que vai à desfilada nos sonhos contraditórios,
do que engendra imagens capciosas e julga viver em liberdade,
mas é só imprudente e explosivo, mas esbarra
nas malhas deste mundo, nos imprevistos
da traição e da morte, ou tem de renunciar perante os rasgos
mais sublimes. a paixão dilacera bruscamente as personagens
apegadas à felicidade, os obstáculos
também têm protagonistas, ajustes de contas, cruéis fulgores,
perseguições, e nos casos desvairados de amor não há saída.
desse falhanço insuportável nasce o melodrama,
lírico, incontido, entre golfadas de espiral vertiginosa
com o sangue e a memória, com o que não tem remédio e a música trágica,
em que alguém vai morrer, alguém se perde alucinado,
e alguém se salva e porventura alguém escreve
a história e alguém lhe junta a música
para as emoções serem mais opressivas e talvez mais devoradoras
e mais fáceis, e alguém tem o desejo disso, um estremecimento
de arrepio e vulgaridade, um ávido prazer inconfessado.","sentimental education
we often live according to a rash
notion of stark contrasts between good
and evil, greatness and wretchedness, the swift deeds
of an avid heroism and the inexorable march of destiny,
melodrama being part of our deepest nature,
obscurely but stubbornly nostalgic for the radical heart,
which races at top speed in contradictory dreams,
which engenders seductive images and thinks it lives in freedom,
but it’s merely reckless and explosive, it stumbles
into the world’s snares, into unexpected
treachery and death, or it must renounce in the face of the most
sublime flashes. passion rudely lacerates people
attached to happiness. the obstacles we meet
also have protagonists, scores to settle, cruel splendors,
feverish pursuits. and in desperate cases of love there’s no way out.
from that unbearable failure is born lyrical, unbridled
melodrama, amid whirling, dizzying spurts
of blood and memory, of dashed hopes and tragic music,
in which someone dies, someone goes mad,
and someone is saved, and maybe someone writes down
the story, and someone else adds music
for the emotions to be more oppressive and perhaps more consuming
and facile, and someone desires this, it makes someone feel a shiver
of tingling banality, a voracious and unconfessed thrill.",pt_XX,en_XX,"for sentimental education.
so many times you live from a bitter struggle
notion of the strongest contrasts between good and evil
bad, between grandeur and abstraction, between the quick
the periphecies of an eager heroism and the inevitable destiny,

nostalgic, obscurely nostalgic of the radical heart,
from what goes deep into contradictory dreams,
from what generates captivating images and thinks of living in freedom,
but it's just reckless and explosive, but it

more sublime. Passion suddenly dissolves the characters
attached to happiness, the obstacles
they also have protagonists, accounting adjustments, ugly cruelties,
persecutions, and in cases of broken love, there's no way out.
from this unbearable failure the melodrama is born,
lyrical, unintentionally, in the midst of waves of vertiginous spiral
with the blood and the memory, with what doesn't have medicine and the tragic music,
in which someone is going to die, someone gets lost in a hallucination,
And someone saves themselves, and maybe someone writes
the story and someone adds the music
for emotions to be more oppressive and perhaps more destructive
and easier, and someone has the desire of that, a shake
of bitterness and vulgarity, an innate unconfessed pleasure."

i’m universally uncomfortable, metaphysically uncomfortable,
but what’s even worse is my headache.
that’s more serious than the meaning of the universe.
once, while walking in the country around oxford,
i saw up ahead, beyond a bend in the road,
a church steeple towering above the houses of a hamlet or village.
the photographic image of that non-event has remained with me
like a horizontal wrinkle marring a trouser’s crease.
today it seems relevant...
from the road i associated that steeple with spirituality,
the faith of all ages, and practical charity.
when i arrived at the village, the steeple was a steeple

I want the good, and I want the evil, and in the end, I don't want anything.
I'm badly laid on the right, and badly laid on the left
and lacking consciousness of existence.
I'm universally evil, metaphysically evil,
But the worst part is, it hurts my head.

once, by the side of Oxford, on a wooden sidewalk,
I saw myself rising, from a curve of the road, at the nearest distance
the old church tower above the village or village houses.
I became a photographer of this zero incident
like a cross-section slapping the knot of your pants.
now, by the way...
from the road I preached spirituality to this church tower
that was the faith of all the ages, and effective charity.
from the village, when I got there, the church tower was the church tower,
And, still up there, it was there.

"a viagem de alexandre à índia
andaste de um ao outro lado da terra na vida interminável,
tiveste degredos, piedosos cíumes, a fé desvanescida,
amantes paradas na lavoura, roubando-te o rosto amado.
viste vestígios de que foste a sombra de ninguém,
olhos sem pudor, do reflexo dos ferros no tropel,
franjas do domínio pueril de alexandre, olhando gaugamela.
partiste num porto de transição para o levante,
com vazios para trás, todo o tempo a poder ver,
e ao primeiro inverno, pelos cardeais das suas cinzas,
começaste a travessia que não termina, a história que não acaba.
soubeste porque se vislumbra, em lágrimas, o pinheiro da juventude,
o nome quebrado num turvo ar medido sem corda,
e a maresia do vento de feição no segundo inverno.
em troca perseguiste o que rege o homem fortuito,
segredando em palácios de mármore que são apenas pedras,
dos fracassos a que jamais alguém ajoelhara.
ao terceiro inverno descobriste o hemisfério, e ao quarto,
sem ideia de guerra ou ordem para mudar o reino,
escolheste adornar os aquedutos sob o manto dos regatos,
sentado, na brisa no tanque, ao febril entardecer.
de quem te aproximaste, no seu trajecto interminado,
sem lugar senão o que esfria na mente recortada,
naquilo que se ramifica, tornando-se na própria teia,
contigo propagou o dever de passar em toda a parte.
e quando veio o quinto inverno, e o sexto, suturaste o sangue,
trouxeste a pele à curva dos rios, acolheste o que de resto se desmorona,
e pudeste enfim, na crença dos migradores furtivos, entender que
tudo se perde noutro lugar ainda, e após esse ainda noutro
e que ao fim de cada manhã noutra manhã
tudo é incerto, tão conforme o dente-de-leão no meio de searas,
tão emudecido como a veia exausta dos não sepultados.
na mansarda onde vagueia o dia e a noite
o vento responde, cortando o centeio e o calcário, e a vela
que brilha na luz de estrelas veladas, já desaparecidas,
pisadas, mudas, engolidas aos pés do sétimo inverno,
arpoa o coração e a ruína — os meridianos despem-se, voam
em vinte e cinco anos que há pouco se beijavam, e seja dito ou não dito

por lábios que só as mulheres conhecem

o princípio e o fim do teu poder na terra.","alexandres`s travel to india
you wandered an interminable life across the earth,
suffered exile, piteous jealousy, futile faith,
labour-arrested lovers plundering your beloved’s face.
you saw traces of having been no one’s shadow,
impudent eyes, the reflection of iron on the rampage,
hints of alexander’s puerile dominance, contemplating gaugamela.
you set off from a transient port towards the levant,
leaving emptiness behind, seeing all of time,
and in the first winter, by the cardinals of its ashes,
you started the endless crossing, the incessant history.
you knew, because the pine tree of youth can be glimpsed through tears,
of the shattered name in a cloudy mood measured without ropes,
and of the favourable sea breeze in the second winter.
in exchange you pursued that which rules the fortuitous man,
whispering in marble palaces that are but stones,
failures to which no one had ever knelt.
by the third winter you discovered the hemisphere, and by the fourth,
non intent on war or order to change the kingdom,
you chose to adorn aqueducts with the mantle of streams,
sitting by the pool breeze, in the evening´s lingering fever.
whomever you approached, in their indefinite path,
without a place except that which fades inside a patchy mind,
in that which branches out and becomes the very web,
has spread with you the duty to pass through everywhere.
and by the fifth winter, and the sixth, you stitched up the blood,
brought the skin on to the river bends, welcomed that which falls apart,
and were at last capable, with the belief of a stealthy migrant, of understanding
that all is lost yet in another place, and after this in yet another
and that by the end of each morning in another morning
all is uncertain, just like a dandelion in a field of wheat,
as muted as the exhausted vein of the unburied.
in the attic where night and day roam
the wind replies, cutting the chalk and the rye, and the candle,
shimmering in the light of the veiled stars already gone,
trodden, voiceless, swallowed up by the seventh winter,
spears the heart and the ruin — the meridians undress, fly away
in twenty five years that were just kissing yesterday, and be it told or untold

children of the pueril domain of alexandre, looking at gaugamela.

with voids behind, all the time being able to see,
And in the first winter, through the hearts of their kidneys,
you started the unfinished travesty, the unfinished story.
I learned that in tears, the glow of youth shines,
the name broken in a measuring air of turmoil without a string,

In return, you pursued what ruled the fortuite man,
secreting in marble palaces that are just stones,
of failures that no one ever complained about.

"da minha janela
mar alto! ondas quebradas e vencidas
num soluçar aflito e murmurado...
vôo de gaivotas, leve, imaculado,
como neves nos píncaros nascidas!
sol! ave a tombar, asas já feridas,
batendo ainda num arfar pausado...
ó meu doce poente torturado
rezo-te em mim, chorando, mãos erguidas!
meu verso de samain cheio de graça,
’inda não és clarão já és luar
como branco lilás que se desfaça!
amor! teu coração trago-o no peito...
pulsa dentro de mim como este mar
num beijo eterno, assim, nunca desfeito!...","from my window
high sea! vanquished waves
breaking with whispered, troubled sighs…
immaculate, weightless flight of gulls,
like snows appearing on the hilltops!
sun! a bird falling, still flapping
its wounded wings while gasping for breath…
to you, sweet tortured sunset, i lift
my hands in inward prayer, weeping!
o my charming verse of samain,
not yet daylight, already you’re moonlight,
like a white lilac whose flowers wither!
love! i carry your heart in my breast…
it pounds within me like this sea
in an endless, never withering kiss!...",pt_XX,en_XX,"from my window
high seas! broken and vengeful waves
in an affectionate, murmuring smile...

It's like snow in a born chicken!
sun! bird roaring, wings already wounded,
still banging in a paused fist...
oh my dear tortured patient
bury you in me, crying, hands raised!
my verse of free-flowing saami,
It's not dawn, it's moonlight.
as white lilac that dissolves!
my love, your heart, I hold it in my chest...
it pulses in me like this sea
in an eternal kiss, like this, never broken!..."

foi na verdade a sede que me tirou
da estrada. num café de província,
cadeiras de napa cor de laranja
bordavam um balcão quase vazio.
numa esquina, para poder falar
olhos nos olhos, sentava-se um casal
adolescente. na testa dele – que
era dos dois o mais bonito – bailava
sozinha uma pérola de suor, sinal
de que haveria coisas difíceis para
dizer. mas, vendo bem, os tornozelos
dela eram tão finos que não iam
aguentar aquela confissão. bebi
correndo a minha água gelada para
não atrapalhar o choro dela; e, antes
de sair, dei comigo a pensar que nem
me importaria muito de ser traída, se
pudesse ter outra vez aquela idade.","ankles
in the end it was thirst that got me
off the street. into a café, serendipitous,
orange nappa chairs
bordering an almost-empty bar.

in a corner so they could speak
face-to-face. the boy – the more
attractive of the two – had a drop
of sweat dancing down his brow, a sign
that a difficult discussion lay
ahead. but then again, her ankles
were so weak that surely they couldn’t
withstand any type of confession. i gulped

it was the most beautiful of the two — it was swimming
