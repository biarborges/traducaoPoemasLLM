bonjour et salut
depuis toujours je bougeais pour comprendre
voici parmi les manières de raconter
une
j'étais jeune au départ
je ne connaissais pas ma taille
car je ne connaissais ni bien ni mal ni choses ni rien
car les serpents n'ont pas la connaissance
de la hauteur de la largeur c'est faux
car je n’étais pas serpent mais j’aurais
pu car je remarqu’cent fois +
mille tout est faux mais vrai
les serpents mesurent ce qu'ils trouv avec leurs corps c'est leur manière
d'être en vie et ce fût ma manière
voulant comprendre le monde avec mon corps écoutez-moi
j’aimais mon existence
et je m’agenouillais pour ainsi dire devant ce sentiment
il faudrait le comprendre
j’avais le don de moi sur terre
suppliant donnant détruisant
rendant ordonnant accourant
rencontrant trainant revenant
servant appelant rentrant
protégeant réglant je charbonnais ma
gueule entendant descendant sonnant
ébranlant courant jaillissant décochant
planant écoutant écrivant calculant
j’en ai vu sautillant déplaçant
titubant caressant bondissant parlant
noyant
j’ai reculé frappé flotté
je jure mes têtes mes morts
balançant écrasant vissant vissant dans quoi vissant
j’ai beaucoup mythonné
j’ai mythonné les jours
j’ai mythonné le corps
j’ai mythonné moi-même
sage gai triste en colère
m'ennuyant ayant froid ayant peur ayant mal faisant mal
vitement calmement vivement
je ramassais les os de petites créatures
mortes je calculais
les kilomètres parcourus par des insectes
hérissés de cils courts clairsemés
dans le pourri indéfiniment r’
résisteraient les fibres les nervures des feuilles
réduisant par
cisaille
les résidus en pate dans leurs petits intestins – ces insectes
que j’imaginais
et distribuais mes molécul au hasard par ma langue que je passais sur
les meubles dans la maison et sur les murs
les rues les bancs le métro sur les écharp des gens le peupl
je voulus me répandre
souvent je téléphonais à mes amis pour leur dire – je n'existe pas
mes amis répondaient tu n'existes pas
car je n’avais pas d’amis
au hasard les voix des numéros disaient –qui êtes-vous
je répondais – je n'existe pas ils répondaient – oui
je répondais – et dîtes-mois pourquoi je n'existerais pas
ils répondaient des paroles que je rayais
je les rayais et je rayais les feuilles sur les arbr
que je croisais avec une aiguille
méchante méchante et je classais mes objets par ordre alphabétiqu et
je les détestais
j
me roulant
à l'intérieur de me longtemps
et il n’y eût ni quête ni marais ni grain
ni inférieurs ni supérieurs ni sommet
ni capitale ni troupes ni majesté
ni zguègues ni balance ni millions
ni kichta ni bombes ni jardin ni religion ni cause
pour me calmer
j'imaginais des asticots plus longs que vous et me
dans les zones des aires de la nature
plus étendus que mon père et mes soeurs
ma mère et tous les cousinages des périmètres
il faut me croire à propos de moi je pensais du vide
la route était dure autour de me
ma main ne possédait ni bien ni mal ni rien
chaque matin devenait pire car le matin ne possédait ni rien ni rien
les dimensions deviennent douloureuses
ceci blesse
ceci blesse
comme rien ne ressembl à rien tout ressemble à tout
exactement exactement je me le dis
la membrane entre la lumière et l'oeil
une chose sans forme déformée
je profite de moi comme une sécurité
profitant du vocabulaire
profitant de me comme une sécurité
profitant de me comme un profit
soudain les angles furent des angles et les pointes des pointes
je m’endormis

hello and hi there
i always longed to understand
so here amongst the many ways of telling is
one
i was young to begin with
i didn’t know my size
as i didn’t know right or wrong or anything or nothing
as snakes aren’t aware
that height and width is wrong
as i wasn’t a snake but i could
have because i notice a hundred times +
a thousand everything is wrong but right
snakes measure whatever they find with their bodies it’s their way of
being alive and that was my way
wanting to understand the world with my body listen to me
i loved my existence
and i bowed down so to speak before that feeling
you must understand
i had the gift of myself on earth
begging giving destroying
submitting ordering rushing
finding dragging returning
serving calling coming back
protecting resolving i blackened my
mouth hearing descending resounding
shaking running spurting shooting
gliding listening writing calculating
i saw some bouncing shifting
staggering stroking leaping speaking
drowning
i retreated struck flustered
i swear on my life my death
swinging crushing screwing screwing in what screwing
i bullshitted a lot
i bullshitted days
i bullshitted bodies
i bullshitted myself
good joyful sad angry
getting bored being cold being afraid being hurt hurting
quickly calmly deeply
i collected the bones of little
dead creatures i calculated
the kilometres covered by insects
bristling with short thin lashes
in the indefinitely rotten air
the leaf’s fibres its veins will resist
reduction by
shears
the pasty residue in their small intestines – these insects
that i imagined
and randomly disbursed my molecules with my tongue which i passed over the furniture in the house and over the walls
the streets the benches the metro on people’s scarves the people
i wanted to spread myself around
i often called my friends to tell them - i don’t exist
my friends responded you don’t exist
as i didn’t have any friends
the random voices dialled said – who are you
i replied – i don’t exist they replied – yes
i replied – and tell me why i don’t exist
they replied with the words that i scratched out
i scratched them out and i scratched the leaves onto the trees
that i crossed with a needle
naughty naughty and i arranged my objects in alphabetical order and
i hated them
i
turning myself
within iself for a long time
and there was no quest or marsh or grain
no lowers or uppers or summit
or capital or troops or majesty
or dicks or account or millions
no coin or bombs or garden or religion or cause
to calm myself
i imagined maggots longer than you or i
in the airy parts of nature
stretchier than my father and my sisters
my mother and all the distant cousins
believe me when i say i thought of emptiness
the road was hard around me
my hand held no right or wrong or anything
every morning got worse because the morning didn’t hold a thing not a thing
dimensions become painful
that hurts
that hurts
as nothing looks like anything everything looks like everything
exactly exactly i tell myself
the membrane between light and eye
a deformed formless thing
i enjoy myself as a safety
enjoying vocabulary
enjoying i as a safety
enjoying i as an enjoyment
suddenly angles were angles and points were points
i fell asleep",fr_XX,en_XX,"'the book of the sea and the long' (fragment)
With his two hands, he tooked dusty ashes,
that he poured on his gray head through very strong.

Good morning and salutation
I've always moved to understand
There are between the ways to tell
it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's
I was young away
I didn't know my size
'Cause I didn't know well or bad or things or anything
'Cause serpents don't have know
of the height of the whiteness is untrue
'cause I wasn't a snake, but I would've
could because I've remarked a hundred times plus
A thousand everything is fall but true
Snakes measure what they found with their bodies is their way
to be in life and it was my way
Looking to understand the world with my body, listen to me
I loved my existence
And I kneeled to say in front of this sentiment
it would be understand
I had the gift of me on the earth
Pleasant giving destroying

I've got a lot of mythonness
I've mythonned the days
I've mythonned the body
I've mythonned myself
wish sad gay in furry
I'm tired of being cold fearing which pain hurting
fastly quietly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly fastly
I'd take the birds of little cries
deaths I callted
the paths traversed by insects
Wrinkled with short eyes
in poorry forever and forever
would resist the fibres the nerveurs of the leaves
reduced by
Cissal
pate residues in their little intestines – these insects
that I imagined
And differing my mole by chance by my langue that I passed on
the furniture in the house and on the walls
the streets the banks the metro on the people's scarp the people
I wanted to flow myself
I often phoned to my friends to tell them – I don't exist
My friends were asking you don't exist
'Cause I didn't have friends
At random the voices of the numbers said – who are you
I were asking – I don't exist they were asking – yes
I'd answer – and tell me why I wouldn't exist
They would respond to the words I was wasning
I were raying them and I were raying the leaves on the arbs
that I crossed with a pin
bad, bad, and I classed my objects in alphabetical order and
I loved them
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine,
I'm rolling
Inside me for a long time
And there wouldn't be searching for them, there wouldn't be married, there wouldn't be searching for them, there would be searching for them, there wouldn't be searching for them, there wouldn't be searching for them, there wouldn't be searching for them, there wouldn't be searching for them, there wouldn't be searching for them, there wouldn't be searching for them, there wouldn't be searching for them, there wouldn't be searching for them, there wouldn't be searching for them, there wouldn't be
No inferiors, no superiors, no tops
No capital, no troupes, no majesty
no marks, no balance, no millions
No kichta, no bombs, no garden, no religion, no cause
to soothe me
I imagined asticotes longer than you and me
in the zones of nature's fields
more expansive than my father and my sisters
my mother and all the countings of the perimetries
You got to believe me about me I thinked empty
The road was hard around me
my hand had no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right, no right
Every morning had been worry 'cause the morning had nothing or nothing
The dimensions turn to pain
it's hurting
it's hurting
like nothing seems to nothing everything seems to everything
Precisely, I say to myself
the membrane between the light and the eyes
a thing without deformed form
I'm profiting from me like a stee
profiting from the vocabulary
taking use of me like a stee
profiting from me as a profit
Suddenly the angles were angles and the tips of the tips
I sleep
I'm fine. I'm fine."

he will become a flower, an herb or even a tree.

Her arms,
Her legs
And all her life,
A whole skeet
And his flesh,
A whole being at all of a sudden turned into dust.
So we put it in the earth of the garden,
we say to each others it's like broth
And just with a little chance
it will be a flower, a herb or even a tree.
then we'll get to water it
And it's far better than crying
And every day we think about it,
We'll gi it a little water,
We'll talk to her in her head
or sometimes with a high voice,
it's becoming a ritual
And it's far less sad
just go to the cemeteria
To talk with the stoles."

i often tell him fuck off daddy.

i never say it out loud, there’s no need,

fuck off daddy,
fuck off, why did you pass away so early?
why did you leave mommy behind?
fuck off, for not being there
when we needed you,
for still not being there.
he doesn’t even make an effort to interfere in my dreams.

of him, dreaming about a conversation, a walk, a shared moment.

I often tell her, you don't care, daddy.

I've never said it aloud, no need,
If he he can hear me, he can hear what's in my head.
You're makin' a lot of pain,
You don't care to be leavin' so early,
for leaving my mom all alone.
You're making fun of not being here

jusqu'à ce que l'engin gagne le ciel . . .

"extraits de la migration des murs
ce n’est pas tous les jours qu’on parle des murs attention sujet tabou là-dessus, c’est tout le monde qui fait le mort
la question des murs
la civilisation des murs est arrivée à sa fin pour que les murs redeviennent viables, ils doivent tomber
les murs ont sur nous une longueur d'avance pas la peine de chercher le nombre de pieds que fait un mur quête sans niveau avec une bulle en profondeur l’homme, muté là dans le flou de son ponçage, peut s’atteler à mesurer les murs à l’aune de ses fémurs, pour comprendre leur évolution et leur marche dans l’histoire
les murs que l’on regarde à distance demeurent juste des murs de façade il faudrait un peu méditer sur les murs des maisons qui parfois sont sans fenêtre, ni porte de secours nulle vue qui ne donne sur l’humain
solide absence de liens, solide absence de ciment social des espèces et des espaces fortement critique le cas clinique du monde au pied du mur de ce côté dur de la réalité des murs, c’est à la base la vie qui en sort écrasée
abordons le chapitre du monde, en gros, ce n'est qu'une histoire de murs
encore une couche de couleur et le mur se tape d’une vie plus que ferme les couleurs sont pour les murs effets spéciaux de maquillage sur les paupières
les murs ont des odeurs mais n’aiment surtout pas qu’on mette le nez dans leurs affaires
cela ne sert à rien de diaboliser les murs le problème remonte à l’équerre, parmi d’autres instruments à géométrie variable les propriétaires, petits et gros, pèsent très lourd sur le dur marché des murs dès l’enfance de l’équerre, ils ont posé la première pierre, ils sont arrivés ensuite à imposer les murs comme seul horizon indépassable
qui a dit que l'équerre était l'enfance des instruments un instrument marqué à ce point au millimètre, saurait-il avoir une enfance
il existe une nouvelle migration beaucoup plus forte que celle des flux qui poussent le sang à bouger les lignes dans tous les sens des hémisphères une migration en dur qui massacre le champ libre du cœur à coups de barre de fer
dans les rayons des services de l’immigration, il est loisible d’identifier les agents visibles des murs, ce sont de vrais numéros, avec leurs code-barres d’hommes vendus au prix fort sur le marché
les murs sont des preuves matérielles de la lourdeur de notre époque","extract from the migration of walls
it’s not every day we talk about walls taboo subject, careful down there, they all make death
a question of walls
the civilisation of walls has come to an end to again become viable, walls must fall down
walls long precede us don’t bother counting the feet that make up a wall immeasurable search for a bubble in the depths man, mutated in a mist of sanding, can measure walls using his thighbone as a yardstick, to understand his evolution and his course through history
the walls we see from a distance are still just mock walls houses that are sometimes without windows or an emergency door merit a little meditation
solid absence of ties, solid absence of social cement for species and spaces the clinical case of the world is seriously critical at the foot of the wall on this harsh side of the reality of walls, fundamentally, it’s life that ends up crushed
let’s have a look at a chapter on the world, all in all, it’s nothing but a story of walls
another colourful sunset and the wall helps itself to an ever-solid life
for walls colours are the special effects of make-up on eye-lids
walls have smells but they really don’t like us to stick our noses in their business
there’s no point demonising walls the problem starts with t-brackets, amongst other kinds of geometric tools landlords, big and small, weigh very heavy on the harsh wall market the first stone was cast when the t-bracket came about, walls were then imposed as the only impassible horizon
who was it that called the t-bracket the mother of tools does a tool marked up to the millimetre know how to be a mother
there is a new migration much stronger than the influx that moves blood in lines through all the hemispheres’ senses a fierce migration that massacres the heart’s free roaming with iron bars
within the realms of immigration services, it’s permissible to identify visible wall agents, they’re real characters, with their barcodes of men sold at a good price on the market
walls are material proof of the burden of our times",fr_XX,en_XX,"from the migration of the walls
it's not every days that we talk of the walls attention to the subject tabou about it, it's everyone who makes death
the question of the walls
the civilisation of the walls has come to an end so that the walls come back viable, they have to fall
The walls have on us a long left no pain to look for the number of feet that a wall looks without evening with a bubble in depth man, muted there in the full of its drinking, can work to measure the walls to the ane of its femors, to understand their evolution and their walk in the story
The walls we look away still remain just front walls we would have to meditate a little on the walls of the houses who sometimes are without a window, no door of reserve no see that gives on the human
solid absence of links, solid absence of social cement of species and spaces, heavily criticizes the clinical case of the world at the base of the wall on this hard side of the reality of the walls, it's on the base life that comes out of it
le's go to the world's world, enough, it's just a story of walls
Again a cover of color and the wall takes up with a life more than closes the colors are for the walls special effects of making on the eyes
The walls have smells but do not like we put out in their businesss
it's no use to diabolize the walls the problem goes back to the wall, between the other instruments with variable geometries, the homeers, big and big, weigh very heavy on the dur market of the walls as from the childhood of the wall, they put the first stone, then have come to impose the walls as the only underviable horizon
who said that the equerry was the childhood of instruments, an instrument marqued to this point in the millimeter, is it possible to have a childhood
there exists a new migration far more stronger than that of the fluxes that move the blood to move the lines in all the ways of the hemispheres a searching in dur that massacres the freefield of the heart with bars of iron
In the rays of the services of immigration, it's possible to ID the visible agents of the walls, it's real numerals, with their bar codes of men sold at the strongest cost on the market
The walls are material proofs of the heavy of our era"

Give you a name?
Give you a name when you dance in the dark in deserted streets with big dogs?
Give you a name when you go to the river in a night suit under a big sun Ignoring the men who have lost by believing to take you?
I'll give you angels
And to skin them a knive not greater than the inch
An ivory knive that I would have flyed after the fight
the gift of a dead to an other woman
And you'll have to think about her, her cold sheets, the hoop in her pocket in place of the knive

"kasala pour mon kaku
mon arrière-grand-père, kaku, comme on le désignait affectueusement
avait longtemps vécu
il avait 105 ans; 120, 134, 142, 157, 169, 186, 192
peut-être même 2 siècles
mon kaku était tellement vieillot
à telle enseigne qu’il avait cessé de compter son âge
il ne se rappelait même plus dans quel siècle il était né
mon kaku avait l’âge du soleil
mon kaku avait l’âge du déluge
mon kaku, oui, mon kaku avait l’âge du fleuve zambèse
mon kaku avait l’âge du mississippi
mon kaku avait l’âge du danube
mon kaku avait l’âge du chemin de fer lubumbashi-ilebo
mon kaku avait l’âge de la nouvelle guinée (x 5)
plusieurs fois, mon kaku souhaita crever mais la mort le boycotta
chaque matin, on le déposait sur une chaise à bascule
dans la véranda, face au soleil
on le ravitaillait en nourriture à midi
au crépuscule, mon kaku tournait encore ses mâchoires
puis, on l’installait dans sa chambre
le corps, son corps, le corps de kaku ne fonctionnait plus
à force de vieillesse, il avait perdu de sa mobilité
seules sa voix et sa mémoire demeuraient intactes
kaku parlait sans frein
kaku racontait sa petite enfance à dimbelenge
kaku pérorait sur sa jeunesse mouvementée
kaku s’étendait longuement sur sa vie dans les mines de bakwanga et du katanga; kaku de sa verve légendaire retraçait l’exode familial, égrenait la généalogie de mwanza-wa-mwanza, rappelait à la mémoire le zaïre, s’attardait sur la première guerre du shaba, évoquait lumumba, le massacre des creuseurs de katakelayi, les barbouzes de la deuxième république . . .
blotti dans son rocking chair
une barbe-océan lui dévorant son menton
mon kaku devenait même prophète
il prédisait des républiques à venir, des étoiles incandescentes, des chemins de fer reliant tout le pays, des villes enivrées de lumière, des populations ébahies
avec la même verve, le même engouement, la même bave, mon kaku parlait, mon kaku parlait, mon kaku parlait . . .
(rires)
quelle nostalgie, quelle mélancolie, quelle solitude, quelle angoisse
nous, scolopendres, on est en train de lutter contre cette vie de chien

my great-grandfather, kaku, as we affectionately called him
had lived for a long time
he was 105 years old; 120, 134, 142, 157, 169, 186, 192
maybe even 2 centuries of age
my kaku was such an antique
that he had stopped counting the years
he was no longer certain even of the century in which he was born
my kaku was as old as the sun
my kaku was as old as the flood
my kaku, yes, my kaku was as old as the zambezi river
my kaku was as old as the mississippi
my kaku was as old as the danube
my kaku was as old as the lubumbashi-ilebo railroad
my kaku was as old as new guinea (x 5)
more than once, my kaku had wanted to die but death had boycotted him
every morning, we settled him in his rocking chair
on the veranda, facing the sun
we fed him at noon
at dusk, my kaku was still working his jaws
then we put him to bed
the body, his body, the body of kaku no longer responded
due to old age, he had lost his ability to move
only his voice and memory remained intact
kaku talked without stint
kaku retold his early childhood in dimbelenge
kaku expounded upon his turbulent youth
kaku held forth on his life in the mines of bakwanga and katanga; kaku, with his legendary verve, recounted the family exodus, reeled off the genealogy of mwanza-wa-mwanza, summoned up memories of zaire, dilated on the first war in shaba, evoked lumumba, the massacre of the katakelayi diggers, the secret agents of the second republic...
nestled in his rocking chair
an oceanic beard swallowing up his chin
my kaku became a prophet
he augured republics to come, incandescent stars, railroads connecting all points of the nation, cities drunk on light, dumbfounded populations
with the same verve, the same pleasure, the same spittle, my kaku talked, my kaku talked, my kaku talked...
(laughter)
what nostalgia, what melancholy, what solitude, what anguish we, the centipedes, we writhe against this dog’s life

it didn't even remember in what century it was born

every morning, we put it on a rocking chair
in the veranda, in front of the sun
it would be refriended in sunight
At dusk, my kaku was still turning her hands
Then, we'd place it in his room
the body, its body, the body of kaku was no longer working
by force of an old, he had lost his movement
only his voice and his memory remained intact
Kaku talked without abrace
Kaku told his little childhood in dimbeleng
Kaku was fading on his moved youth
Kaku was longing on his life in the mines of bakwanga and katanga; kaku of his lineval verva retrached family exode, screamed the genealogy of mwanza-wa-mwanza, remembered the Zaïre, was starting on the first war of the Shaba, starting lumumba, the massacre of the katakelayi dippers, the barbouzes of the second republic. . .
Blotti in his rocking flesh
a beard-ocean everying his mind
my kaku was even becoming a prophesy
it prediced future republications, incandescent stars, iron paths connecting the whole country, intoxicated towns of light, ebahied populations

bouleversée par la bourrasque. – hors
de notre vue ! paroles incapables
de contenir l’émotion sans pathos du vent :
du vent car de quoi parlions-nous au juste
à coups de néologismes et de périphrases plus lourdes
pour saisir des nuances plus fines ? – de rien
voilà le clou. eh bien c’est pareil aujourd’hui
si je demande à quoi tu penses, tu t’accroches
de solide pour courir le long d’une vis sans fin
à quelle rampe, présence épaisse, pilier, n’importe
quoi empêche la vie de dériver : certitude ici
maintenant ou sujet de conversation. – rien !
d’ailleurs il suffisait de poser la question
comme on lâche une feuille devant les pales en bout
de ligne pour voir qu’elle s’envole au début
de la ligne suivante. – à l’instant où tu rebondis
sur le trottoir après la dernière marche
tu n’es qu’un photogramme et le paysage avec toi
gelé par la touche « pause » du magnétoscope
mais qui ne veut pas s’arrêter, tremble comme une feuille
ou on rongeur piégé qui gigote pour rejoindre
ses semblables. l’image aussi veut rentrer dans la danse
des images/seconde. quel est cet élan qui
frappe de vanité tous les dépôts, voitures garées
immeubles rescapés du bombardement de la nuit
et résolutions de réveil ? à tout point de vue,
qu’il soit extérieur embusqué dans le paysage
traversé aboli comme un sniper te tient en joue
pour venger l’univers à quoi tu joues ce mauvais tour
ou intérieur, ton point de vue privé de ses repères,
c’est un mouvement de mort, escalade et dégringolade
une soif inextinguible, un appel répété
au sacrifice (et j’en rajoute exprès), une surenchère
dans la dévastation. – mais c’est aussi
tout le contraire cet aller simple
que rien ne justifie. pas un plaisir
car ça ne donne rien et chaque instant te dépossède
du spectacle emballé par le rétroviseur
en rivant ton regard au tronçon de route qui fonce
vers toi. une jouissance pure de contenu :
l’idée visible de la danse dans le miroir
qui a mangé le mur derrière la rampe et vide
la piste de ses cavaliers apprentis trop inquiets
de leur pied droit sur place (temps faibles) et du gauche
en arrière de côté (temps forts) pour s’admirer
évoluant. disparus corps et biens comme toi
les parisiens d’une photo longtemps posée d’atget
par excès de vitesse ont-ils au moins connu l’orgasme
dans un éternuement ? – le stroboscope les ressuscite
en danseurs, en fugitifs, en fantômes pris sur le fait
le temps de reconnaître en eux tes frères d’armes
puis il faudra glaner d’autres images combustibles
brûler les meubles jusqu’à retrouver le dosage
explosif de l’absence, de la joie et du mouvement.","allegria
what is this impulse
it’s an annihilating movement
but it’s also
joy stripped of content.
what is this impulse that sends you hurtling down
the stairs, missing out the steps of regular breath
when breathing in ‘hee’, breathing out ‘haw’ until you reach the springboard
street? – note that i’m not asking
where that step comes from, too light
for anything to be placed on it, not even a question.
i’d like to name it in memory of a rather offbeat
dialogue in which words got carried off with
the sheets of the block where they’d been neatly aligned
knocked over by a gust of wind. – out
of our sight! words incapable
of containing the pathos-less emotion of the wind:
the wind because what exactly were we talking about
wielding neologisms and heavier periphrases
to capture finer nuances? – of nothing at all
that’s the point. oh well it’s the same today
if i ask you what you’re thinking of, you cling on
intent to run the length of an endless spiral
to whatever rail, thick presence, central pillar, anything
that prevents life going off course: certainty here
and now or subject of conversation. – nothing!
anyhow it was enough to ask the question
as you drop a sheet before the blades at the end
of a line to see if it’ll take off at the beginning
of the next. – at the moment you rebound
from the pavement following the last step
you’re no more than a photogram and the landscape with you
frozen by the pause button on the videotape player
but one that doesn’t want to stop, trembles like a leaf
or a trapped rodent struggling to rejoin
its fellows. the image too wants to enter into the dance
of images/second. what is this impulse that
outmodes all deposits, parked cars
buildings unharmed by the night’s bombardments
and waking resolutions? from any point of view,
whether exterior hidden in the landscape
crossed abolished as a sniper keeps his gun trained on you
to avenge the universe to which you’re directing this dirty trick
or inside, your vision stripped of its reference points,
it’s an annihilating movement, climb and abject fall
an inextinguishable thirst, a repeated call
for sacrifice (and i add to this on purpose), it accelerates
devastation. – but it’s also
just the opposite this one-way trip
that nothing can justify. not a pleasure
for it gets you nothing and each moment deprives you
of the spectacle wrapped into the rear-view mirror
gaze fixed on the stub of road lunging
at you. joy stripped of content:
the visible idea of dance in the mirror
that has consumed the wall behind the projectors emptying
the floor of its dancers in training too concerned
about where their right foot is (upbeat) and their left
at the back and to the side (downbeat) to admire their own
twirls. gone for good like you
parisians of a long-exposed photo by atget
speeding did they at least experience orgasm
in a sneeze? – the stroboscope resuscitates them
as dancers, fugitives, ghosts caught on the run
time enough to recognize them as brothers in arms
then we’ll have to pick up other combustible images
burn the furniture until we find the explosive
dose of absence, joy and movement.",fr_XX,en_XX,"Joy
what's this move?
it's a death movement

what's the move you're taking
the stead, steads crossed with the usual blow
when you draw ""hi"", exhale ""han"" to the storm
from the street? – note I don't ask
where does it come to you that step of light
that nothing is asked, not even a question.
I'd like to name it as a memory of a dialogue
A little crazy where the words came with
the leaves of the ream where them were sewn
Disturbed by the burn. – out
from our see! incapable words
to contain the emotion without pathos of the wind:
of the wind 'cause what were we justly talking about?
with beats of neologisms and heavier periprases
to capture finer nuances? – without anything
here's the nake. Eh, well, it's the same today.
If I ask what do you think, you hold
solid to run along an endless life
what ramp, white presence, pilass, everything
what stops life from adriving: certainty here
now or a conversational subject – nothing!
it was enough to ask the question
how we leave a leaf in front of the pales in the end
to see that it flys away in the first
from the next line. – At the moment you back
on the path after the last move
you're only a photogram and the scene with you
Freezed by the ""pause"" touch of the videotaper
But who doesn't want to stop, tremors like a leaf
where we snow a trapped snow that snows to rejoin
its similar. the image too want to return in the dance
images/self. what's this move that
beats of vanity all depots, parkinged cars

and wake-up resolutions? from all points of view,
that it is an exterior searched in the scenes
Crossed abolished like a sniper keeps you ahead
to revenge the universe what you're playing this wrong turn
or inside, your private point of view of his marks,
it's a movement of death, asclimate and degringolade
an inextinguishable desire, a repetition
to sacrifice (and I add to it only), a sure Auction
in devastation. – But it's also
all the converse this simple go
that nothing is justiciting. Nothing is justiciting.
'Cause it gives nothing and every moment takes you
of the spectacle worked by the retroviewer
While your look back to the path through
to you. pure enjoyment of content:
the visible idea of dance in the mirror
who eated the wall behind the rift and empty
the path of his chivaliers learned too worry
with their right foot on the place (weak time) and the left
back to the side (fast times) to admire each other
flowing. Disparished bodies and wells like you
the parisians of a long-seemed photo of atget
Do they even know the orgasm?
in a sneeze? – the stroboscope resurrects them
In danceers, in fugs, in girls taken on the fait
the time to recognize in them your brothers of arms
Then, we'll have to get more fumes images
burn the furniture to find the dosage
Explosive of absence, joy and movement."

en 1935. après quelques folles nuits très chaudes très sexe dans un hôtel d'arizona. m. john cage épouse mme john cage. en 1935 au coin de la rue de john cage il y a un magasin acmé vendant des aspirateurs. en 1935 mme john cage s'installe dans un nouvel appartement à new york city. le fait est que mme cage. l'épouse de m. cage. ne s'installe pas seule dans un appartement de new york city. en 1935. pour tout dire. quelques machines jouent déjà dans l'appartement de m. et mme cage mais pas d'aspirateur. le fait est que
(comme tout au long de l'expérience, le commentaire s'interrompt, laissant juste john cage ou son équivalent assis immobile et silencieux sur sa chaise, rappelons-le, simple chaise de bois)
lorsqu'il se rend seul en 1935 au magasin acmé john cage a l'intention d'acheter une machine. la femme de john cage est restée seule à l'appartement de john cage et joue avec ses machines. un four électrique pourvu de boutons. une cafetière à cadran. la femme de john cage entretient de bons rapports avec ses machines mais malheureusement ni avec les lave-linges ni avec les aspirateurs. aussi la femme de john cage envoie-t-elle john cage en 1935 acheter quelque chose. une machine. un lave-linge au magasin acmé. aussi quand john cage s'introduit dans le magasin acmé il pense dit-il fermement lave-linge. cependant dit-il une fois dans le magasin acmé il arrive à john cage une chose bizarre. alors que john cage s'apprête comme n'importe qui à faire
(dans cette expérience, le problème sera de laisser courir le silence suffisamment longtemps pour qu'il s'installe, peut-être la solution serait de déterminer sa longueur au hasard, par un tirage aux dés par exemple)

essentielle de john cage en 1935 au magasin acmé tient dans le fait que la langue de john cage passe dans son trou noir. de sorte que. se faisant. l'essentiel de l'expérience de john cage au magasin acmé a lieu dans le silence. même si l'on trouve aisément dans les coins du magasin acmé de 1935 différents modèles de lave-linges à bouton pressoir. même s'il est aisé à john cage de formuler sa demande. il se fait que john cage. le compositeur. un homme du bruit. du son. et de paroles. comme n'importe qui. n'importe qui. eh bien. il se fait que john cage. eh bien. oui. eh bien. il ne sait pas pourquoi. il n'a jamais su pourquoi. le fait est que. en 1935. au magasin acmé. il se laisse littéralement faire. de sorte que. alors que john

(en cours d'expérience, il est aisé de suivre la durée des longueurs par la méthode des crocodiles, 1 crocodile équivalant à 1 seconde, 2 crocodiles à 2 secondes, etc., de sorte que, durant le silence, le ou la comparse de john cage ou son équivalent se récite mentalement et lentement le nombre de crocodiles tiré au sort puis elle ou il reprend son commentaire une fois le compte fini)
cage. dans sa mémoire. lorsque. plus tard. john cage évoquera l'expérience produite en 1935 dans le magasin acmé du coin john cage y pensera. ensuite john cage sort sa carte crédit. ensuite on le voit dans la rue une boîte d'aspirateur sous le bras. ensuite après avoir ôté l'aspirateur de sa boîte la femme de john cage dira qu'il est fou dingue. c'est tout. c'est tout ce qui s'est produit pour john cage une étonnante expérience dans le magasin acmé du coin. en 1935. toujours. une année phare pour john cage. une année riche en expériences. une année de plus sans lave-linge.","the acme store

in 1935. after a few crazy nights very hot very sex in an arizona hotel. mr john cage marries mrs john cage. in 1935 on the corner of the street of john cage there is an acme store selling vacuum cleaners. in 1935 mrs john cage moves into a new apartment in new york city. the fact is that mrs cage. the wife of mr cage. doesn’t move into a new york city apartment by herself. in 1935. to put it frankly. there are already several machines playing in mr and mrs cage’s apartment but not a vacuum cleaner. the fact is,
(since throughout the experiment the commentary is interrupted, leaving john cage or his equivalent just sitting motionless and silent on his chair, remember, a simple wooden chair)
when he goes alone in 1935 to the acme store john cage has the intention of buying a machine. the wife of john cage has stayed alone in the apartment and plays with her machines. an electric oven with buttons. a coffeemaker with a dial. the wife of john cage has good relationships with her machines but unfortunately neither with washing machines nor with vacuum cleaners. so the wife of john cage sends john cage in 1935 to buy something. a machine. a washing machine at the acme store. so when john cage enters the acme store he is thinking firmly he says washing machine. yet he says once inside the acme store something strange happens to john cage. while john cage is preparing like anyone else to make

(it goes without saying that these durations are to be determined before the experiment, before john cage or his equivalent takes his seat on a wooden chair, with his back straight and, why, his hands on his thighs, yes)
experience of john cage in 1935 in the acme store follows the fact that john cage's tongue falls into the black hole. so that. as it happens. the experience of john cage in the acme store takes place fundamentally in silence. even if different models of push-button washing machines are easily found in the corners of the acme store of 1935 . even if it would be easy for john cage to formulate his request. it happens that john cage. the composer. a man of noise. of sound. and of words. like anyone. anyone. what do you know. it happens that john cage. what do you know. yes. what do you know. he doesn't know why. he never knew why. the fact is. in 1935. in the acme store. he literally lets himself get strung along. so that. while john

"de la route jusqu\'à västerås 13
la première partie de la route était segmentée.
il nous fallait descendre dans un supermarché
où les émotions attendaient au congélateur.
une lumière néonisée pesait sur mes paupières.
il était dimanche et peu de voitures remplissaient le parking.
il faisait chaud sur notre fatigue et la voiture beuglait sous nos bagages.
un grand chariot me conduisait par les rayons et je remplissais la corbeille.
ma fille courait de ses jambes et disparaissait dans les étals,
défiant sa babysit aux mains ballantes qui
d'aucune effusion de lèvres et d'aucune main
penchait en arrière,
alors qu'avec l'enfant il faut pencher vers l'avant.
je planais sans résignation sur mon impuissance à être auprès de
l'enfant et de mes achats.
les charges, les surcharges tournoyaient dans ma poitrine
et je n'arrivais pas à les évacuer.
mon cœur me signifiait que je ne savais plus me munir de gants
pour prendre la situation en main.
et dans le constat de mon incapacité
il fallait que je me laisse traverser
par ce qui me dépassait.

the first part of the road was segmented.
we had to go down into a supermarket
where emotions waited in the freezer.
a neon light weighed on my eyelids.
it was sunday and few cars filled the parking lot.
the heat fell over our fatigue and the car blared under our bags.
a large cart drove me through the aisles and i filled the basket.
my daughter dashed and disappeared among the stalls,
defying her babysitter with the dangling arms who
without a coo on her lips and without reaching out her hand
leaned backwards,
whereas with the child one has to lean forward.
i hovered without resignation over my inability to be with
the child and my purchases.
the charges, the surcharges turned about in my chest
and i couldn't manage to get rid of them.
my heart informed me that i no longer knew how take up the gloves
to take the situation in hand.
and in the observation of my incapacity

The first part of the road was segmented.
We had to go down to a supermarket
where the emotions waited for the Freezer.
A neonized light swept on my eyes.
it was Sunday and so many cars full the parking lot.
it was warting on our fatigue and the car was begging under our baggage.
A big car was leaving me through the rays and I'm king the drop.
my girl ran with her legs and disappeared in the stars,
defying his babysit with danced hands that
with no effusion of lips and no hand
He was slipping back,
When with the child, you should should should shouldn't shouldn't shouldn't shouldn't shouldn't.
I walked without resignation on my impotence to be with
the child and my shopping.
the charges, the supercharges were while in my bosom
And I couldn't get away from them.
my heart signaled to me I didn't know how to get on my gants anymore
to take control of the situation.
and in the recognition of my inability
I had to let myself cross
that didnessed me.
even my voice no longer had the strength to elevate or to strength.
I would've knowed to make myself heared
And I was unmeasured in relation to my disqualification."

"ballade de l\'homme mort
comme je marchais sur le promontoire
je m’aperçus que mon père s’était tenu là
au même endroit bien des années plus tôt
et son fantôme m’a traversé
alors que la mer furieuse implorait
mais il y a si longtemps que je suis mort
mort dedans mort devant et tout autour
si longtemps que je traîne mes chaînes
sur la crête de cette falaise au bord du vide
et que le poids du ciel toujours pareil
appuie sur l’armature de mon squelette
pour m’entraîner vers les précipices qui me hantent
quand je lutte au petit matin contre mon ventre
tous les matins toujours pareils
avec la mort qui me tend la main
moi tel l’enfant craintif
qui s’égare dans le labyrinthe
en une féerie triste au fond de sa tête
à travers l’épure oblique des regards
ici sur le rebond de la falaise crayeuse
car tout chemin même immobile
signifie pour moi une falaise compliquée
dont la pente mène vers la mer
vaste drap ondulant dans les fronces du vent
tissu étendu comme un catafalque
par-dessus des gouffres encore
et je marchais sur le promontoire
où mon père s’était tenu avant moi
tous les matins toujours pareils
quand son fantôme m’a traversé
au moment de la renverse de marée
qui happait les corps patients dans le jusant
alors je me suis agenouillé sur le sol
je savais que bientôt mon tour viendrait.","ballad of a dead man
as i walked along the promontory
i noticed my father was standing there
at the same place as years before
and his ghost passed through me
while the raging sea was imploring
but it was so long ago now that i died
death inside death before and around
so long since i dragged my chains
over the ridge of this cliff beside the void
and that burden of the sky ever the same
weighing on my skeleton’s frame
to drag me into the precipices which haunt me
when i struggle at daybreak against my belly
all those mornings ever the same
with death who takes me by the hand
me, such a fearful child
who wanders in the labyrinth
through a sad fairyland deep in his head
across the slanting sketch of glances
here on the bulge of chalky cliff
for all paths even when resting still
mean for me a complicated cliff
whose slope leads down to the sea
vast sheet billowing in the frowns of wind
cloth spread like a catafalque
even now above the chasms
and i was walking along the promontory
where my father had stood before me
all those mornings ever the same
when his ghost passed through me
at the moment of the tide’s turning
which snatched the patient bodies in the ebb tide
i was kneeled there on the ground
i knew that soon my turn would come.",fr_XX,en_XX,"Ballad of the dead man

In the same place so many years before
And his ghonthom crossed me

Death inside death before and all around
So long as I drag my chains
on the cryst of this cleaze by the empty
And the weight of the sky always the same
strenght on my skeet's arm
to train me to the precipices that have me
when I fight in the morning to my best
always the same mornings
with death that holds my hand
I'm like the scared child
who goes away in the labyrinth
In a sad love in the depth of her head
through the oblique pure of the looks
here on the back of the crayous craise
'Cause even away immobilizes
it's a complex cleasure for me
where the sleep goes to the sea
Extensive flowing shoop in the flows of the wind
Tissue expansed like a catfalc
above the waffles again
And I walked on the promontory
where my father had hold before me
always the same mornings
when his ghonthom crossed me
At the moment of the tidal down
that stopped patient bodies in the downside
So I knew myself on the ground
I know my turn will come soon."

dans la mesure où j’observais que ma tête était sur sa nuque productique
mais coupée du reste de mon corps,
je comprenais qu'il ne m'était plus donné de me joindre,
et que ma progression sans qualité devrait se référencer sur les arbres,
dans l'adjacence desquels il me fallait tourner pour exister.
le temps ajouté au temps m'avait rendue plus tendue,
plus négligente et soustraitante de mon corps,
qui ne se dénouait qu'à leur réchauffement
et ne se considérait qu'au vu de leur cousu.
je croyais que ma pesanteur allait se rééquilibrer sur leur poids.
j'imaginais que les bouleaux allaient me déployer mes intentions
à travers leur respiration tranquille.
mais j'observais qu'ils ne pourraient résorber ma déception.
toutefois, de jour comme de nuit, j'inhalais pour mieux m'imprégner d'eux et je continuais à monter et à descendre leurs chemins.
ce qui se testait en moi de toxique portait le nom de vidanges d'émotion.
ce qui dégénérait dans mes chairs était autant de société que de privé.

to the extent that i observed that my head was on its productic neck
but severed from the rest of my body,
i understood it was beyond me to put myself back together,
and that my unqualified progression should link itself to the trees,
in the proximity of which i had to move in order to exist.
time added to time had made me more tense,
more negligent and subcontracting of my body,
which only unwound itself at their warmth
and considered itself in light of their entanglements.
i thought my gravity was going to recover its balance with their mass.
i imagined the birches were going to unfold my intentions
through their tranquil respiration.
but i could see that they wouldn't be able to absorb my deception.
still, day and night, i inhaled to better take them in and
i continued to climb and descend their ways.
that which tested toxic in me bore the name of purges of emotion

that this was only the beginning of an infinite accumulation

and my trunk the receptacle of its excrement.",fr_XX,en_XX,"from the road to västerås 14
In so far as I saw that my head was on her productive nave
but stopped from the rest of my body,
I understand that he was no longer given me to come to my place,

Into the adjacence that I had to turn to exist.
the time added to the time had made me more tensive,
More negligent and subtractive of my body,
which only was under their warm
And believed just in the face of their sewn.
I thought my heaviest would requite on their wonder.
I could imagine birds would deploy my intentions to me
through their peaceful respiration.
But I observed that they couldn't reabsorb my disception.
But, day and night, I inhaled to better empty of them and I kept to go up and down their paths.
what was been tested in me of toxicity were the name of emotion lives.
What would degeny in my flesh was as some as a private man.
My body was wrong with her prison record.
He was dangling to a fight with their iron fingers.
I was afraid that this would know the end,
it was just the beginning of an infinite accumulation
As long as my heart wanted to be the whole

la température de mon âme était depuis longtemps déjà
au-dessous de zéro.
j'étais radicalement seule et le seul ami qui me tenait à cœur
fermait sa promesse à clé.
la promesse entre nous était disgrâcieuse promesse,
ballotée entre resserrement et dilatation.

qui ne dépassait pas la taille d’un pouce.

on the part of my aging self?
what could i do against the deviation of the caresses of my shoulder?

but its oil was not retained by my skin.

was due to a deficiency of my vital energies.

shunted between constriction and dilation.

that enveloped me.

no larger than a thumb.

that wouldn't be more than an inch.

seven naked women
all wearing for finery
a torque around the neck
advancing towards me in a forest
they are wickedly beautiful
redheads or blondes
like the leafy borders avenues
in the wind which enfolds them
they sing lost couplets
and revive ancient vanquished gods
this one with a freckled face
stands before me and says
‘i recognize you. your name is anger’
she takes my sex in her hand
her green eyes moored to mine
whilst both bodies entwine
and murmurs softly depart
i remain still unable to choose
between my civilization and one forgotten
but someone cuts my wrist
laps the blood that runs
before spreading it with the tongue
into every orifice of my body
she who spoke to me gathers my seed
and smears it over my torso
before rejoining the lustful group
leaving me foolish beneath the leafage
surveyed by the half asleep eye of an owl
resembling the eye of war
laughter grows distant in the half-light
i can still discern a mocking voice
dawn husky and crystalline
flayed on the skin of the world
this long voracious serpent
the confused voice reaches me in fragments

until the day you find your true name’

7 Nake women

and return the old gods vanquired
it's with a face covered with ephelides
it stands in front of me it says
I've recognized you. Your name is anger.
she's rounding my sex with her hand
its green eyes upholstered with mine
just as all bodies keep
And what the sweepers sweeper
I'm staying immobilly incapable of choosing
between my civilisation and the forgotten
But someone knows my hand
Lap the blood that drains
before dispending it with the langue
in every orifice of my body
she who talked to me takes my seem
And pours it on my tower
before to rejoin the lascive group
Let's leaving me up the wills
Watched by the own's eyes to the mid of the own
similar to the eyes of war
The laughter goes away in the dark
I'm still believing a smoky voice
Rauque and crystaline daw
fallted on the skin of the world
it's a very long, worry snake
The confused voice arrives to me by smalls
agained by the wind that understands:
Colorful, you will continue roving on the paths
Until the day you'll find your real name
But already all magic has been mistaken
in the deepest of the darkest of forests."

on est en 1935. on est chez le docteur williams. on a une cousine de mme cage en visite chez le docteur williams. c'est une cousine bouclée de mme cage. c'est une cousine de new york city. elle se rend à cette époque. en 1935. en moyenne 3 fois la semaine chez le docteur. le bon docteur williams. il tient un cabinet dans le quartier de l'appartement de john cage. il est aussi le docteur de john cage. lorsque john cage. un jour. décide d'aller chez le docteur en raison de. disons. en raison de quelque chose qui cloche. mettons un trou noir dans la tête. voilà. c'est ça. un jour john cage constate qu'il a un trou noir dans la tête. il
(il conviendra en fait de mettre au point une espèce de chorégraphie ou de pièce musicale où l'on verra john cage ou son équivalent tout d'abord manipuler le journal comme il arrive à tout un chacun de le faire on tourne simplement les pages quoi)
décide alors de se rendre au cabinet du docteur williams. d'abord dans sa salle d'attente. un petit machin de 10 m2. on y a disposé 5 chaises 1 table des magazines et des journaux. il y a là. dira john cage. dira plus tard john cage. tout ce qu'il faut pour se distraire. dira john cage. le compositeur. un homme comme vous et moi. il s'installe un jour dans la salle d'attente du docteur williams. il salue la cousine de mme cage d'une bise sur la joue. puis il s'installe dans la salle d'attente du docteur williams juste à côté d'elle. tandis que 3 autres clients lisent des magazines. ils attendent de passer dans le cabinet du docteur. du bon docteur williams. et. tandis que machinalement john cage. juste pour avoir quelque chose en main. juste pour avoir quelque chose en main. se prend un. pourquoi pas oui. journal. le docteur williams. eh bien. entre dans sa salle d'attente et salue la
(puis au fur et à mesure de l'expérience lors des silences arbitraires ou déterminés par le hasard john cage ou son équivalent ajoutera au chiffonnage du journal des bruits de talons claqués au sol)
compagnie. et demande c'est à qui le tour. et rentre dans son cabinet avec celui ou celle c'est à qui le tour. cette fois-ci une petite vieille. elle a du mal à marcher. elle a un ulcère à la jambe. elle vient changer son pansement. elle vient se faire panser la jambe. elle vient se faire désinfecter puis panser son ulcère à la jambe. désinfecter puis panser par le docteur williams. le bon docteur. et. alors que. dans la salle d'attente la conversation entre john cage et la cousine de mme cage retombe. alors que. subitement john cage joue avec le journal. subitement. sans qu'on s'y attende. sans qu'on s'y attende. il y a le trou noir de la tête de john cage. il fait des siennes. il fait. disons des siennes. de sorte que. john cage. compositeur. subitement. en 1935. un journal à
(en fait john cage ou son équivalent pourrait aussi se lever de la chaise et pourquoi pas faire un pas de danse en même temps qu'il manipule le quotidien)
la main. dans une salle d'attente d'un docteur de new york city. découvre les possibilités musicales. pour le moins époustouflantes. pour le moins époustouflantes. d'un simple quotidien certes épais. certes épais. mais. tout de même. pareil à. pareil à n'importe quel autre. de sorte que. de sorte que. on s'aperçoit très vite. dans la salle d'attente. que quelque chose. on ne sait pas quoi. en 1935 on ne sait pas quoi. pour le moins. perturbe john cage. non pas une nouvelle du quotidien. dira la cousine de mme cage. mais je sais c'est bizarre mais je me dois de te le dire. je ne peux pas ne pas te le dire. ma chérie. dira la
(une structure rythmique mêlant froissement de papiers déchirure du journal claquements de pieds mouvements du corps peut ainsi petit à petit apparaître s'arrêter reprendre de plus en plus frénétiquement)
cousine de mme cage. à mme cage. en personne. en personne. mais quelque chose venant du quotidien lui-même comme si. eh bien. comme si. quelque chose du quotidien lui-même. subitement. absorbait john cage. ton mari. ton mari. tout de même. dira. plus tard. la cousine de mme cage. à mme cage sa cousine. dans une cafétéria sur la 5ième avenue. de sorte que. dans la salle d'attente. eh bien. il y a comme un froid qui circule entre les clients. en fait un trou noir. tandis que le docteur williams. eh bien. fait entrer dans son cabinet le client suivant. un petit vieux aux sourcils broussailleux. il souffre d'une tumeur à la hanche gauche. il boîte en entrant chez le docteur williams. dans son cabinet. et. alors que l'entrée du docteur williams aurait pu. au moins. tirer john cage. le compositeur. l'homme littéralement fasciné. vraiment. par. disons. les hautes potentialités musicales du quotidien. au point que. rien. même l'entrée du docteur williams dans la salle d'attente. même l'entrée du docteur venant. judicieusement. disons judicieusement. rompre. disons. l'atmosphère. le climat de la salle d'attente. le sale climat. instauré. à son insu. à son insu j'insiste. par john cage en personne. l'individu souffrant. en 1935. d'un trou noir dans la tête. au point qu'il doive se
(en fait il serait amusant que john cage ou son équivalent soit 2 voire 3 tout un jeu de mimiques de regards de relations pouvant alors avoir lieu)
rendre. à l'insu de mme cage. chez le docteur williams. malencontreusement également le médecin d'une cousine de mme cage. une blonde bouclée. elle rend ce jour-là une de ses 3 visites semaine chez le docteur williams. elle est peut-être secrètement amoureuse du docteur williams. je crois qu'elle est secrètement amoureuse du docteur williams. dira john cage. l'homme qui. apparemment. apparemment. lorsqu'il reste seul dans la salle d'attente avec la cousine blonde et
(enfin c'est à john cage ou à son équivalent de voir)
bouclée de new york city. n'a même pas remarqué la venue du docteur williams puis la sortie du docteur accompagné cette fois d'une mère de famille et de sa fille qui renifle et qui tousse. elle a 5 ans. elle porte de hauts bas blancs. elle doit avoir la coqueluche. elle ne remarque pas m. cage. l'étrange manège de m. cage. maintenant seul dans la salle d'attente. maintenant seul avec moi. dit la cousine. plus tard. à mme cage. devant un chocolat chaud. quelque part dans une cafétéria de luxe 5ième avenue. à peine rentrée de sa visite chez le docteur elle sonne à sa cousine. elle sonne à l'appartement de m. et mme cage. c'est mme cage qui décroche. elle lui fixe un rendez-vous pour l'après-midi. quelque part sur 5ième avenue. dans une cafétéria de luxe. elle n'hésite pas à dire à mme cage combien elle a trouvé étrange le comportement de john cage. ce matin. dans la salle d'attente du docteur williams. un journal quotidien à la main. elle le dit devant un chocolat chaud. on le sert ici dans de grandes tasses hautes et droites. on le sert ici avec beaucoup de mousse de lait. c'est le lieu favori de rendez-vous de mme cage et de sa cousine. elles peuvent garder ici. en 1935. leur chapeau sur la tête. et. en effet. elles le gardent. de sorte que. lorsque le docteur williams sort de la salle d'attente accompagné de la cousine de mme cage. eh bien. john cage reste seul dans la salle d'attente.
(oui à chacun de voir en fonction de ce qu'on sait faire en fait en fonction de son aisance etc. oui vraiment)
poursuit seul l'expérience singulière et magnifique magnifique vraiment que. depuis environ une heure. il tente maintenant. de sorte que. john cage. épuisé. littéralement. physiquement. par l'intense concentration que nécessite eh bien ce genre d'expérience. eh bien. finit par. disons. sortir de son trou noir. sortir de son trou noir. et. et quitte la salle. c'était donc ça qui était en germe. se dit john cage. une fois dehors. une fois rendu à la rue. c'était donc simplement ça. pas de quoi. vraiment pas de quoi s'inquiéter. se dit john cage. emportant avec lui un magazine. et 2 ou 3 quotidiens. impatient de poursuivre chez lui. un appartement de new york city. ses expériences. heureusement qu'il n'a pas vu le docteur. le bon docteur williams. qu'aurait-il eu à lui dire. heureusement qu'il a eu raison de ne pas inquiéter mme cage. heureusement que j'ai eu raison de ne pas inquiéter mme cage. se dit encore john cage. rentrant à vive allure. d'un bon pas. chez lui. au 3ième étage.","a visit to the doctor
(during the experiment in the doctor’s waiting room john cage or his equivalent is to be seated will have with him a newspaper which he will rustle from time to time during the experiment itself)
it is 1935. at doctor williams’ office. there’s a cousin of mrs cage who’s come to see doctor williams. she’s a curly-haired cousin of mrs cage. she’s a cousin from new york city. these days she goes. in 1935. on average 3 times a week to the doctor. the good doctor williams. he has a practice in the neighborhood of the apartment of john cage. he is also the doctor of john cage. when john cage. one day. decides to go see the doctor because. you could say. because something doesn’t feel right. you could say a black hole in his head. there. that’s it. one day john cage notices he has a black hole in his head. he
(it would be a good idea to prepare a sort of choreography or piece of music where in the beginning john cage or his equivalent will be seen rustling the newspaper as anyone else might do you know just turning the pages)
therefore decides to go see doctor williams. first in his waiting room. a tiny space of 10m2. provided with 5 chairs 1 table magazines and newspapers. there is. john cage will say. john cage will say later. everything you need to keep busy. john cage will say. the composer. a man like you and me. one day he sits down in the waiting room of doctor williams. he greets the cousin of mrs cage with a kiss on the cheek. then he sits down next to her in the waiting room of doctor williams. while 3 other patients are reading magazines. they are waiting to go into the doctor’s office. the good doctor williams. and. while john cage mechanically. just to have something in his hands. just to have something in his hands. takes a. why not yes. newspaper. doctor williams. what do you know. comes into the waiting room and greets
(then as the experiment continues during the silences that are arbitrary or determined by chance john cage or his equivalent will add to the rustling of the newspaper the sound of tapping heels on the floor)
everyone. and asks whose turn it is. and goes back into his office with he or she whose turn it is. this time a little old lady. she has a hard time walking. she has an ulcer on her leg. she’s there to have her bandage changed. she’s there to have her leg bandaged. she’s there to have her leg disinfected then the ulcer on her leg bandaged. disinfected then bandaged by doctor williams. the good doctor. and. while. in the waiting room the conversation between john cage and the cousin of mrs cage drifts off. while. suddenly john cage starts playing with the newspaper. suddenly. without warning. without warning. there is the black hole in the head of john cage. he starts acting strangely. he starts. you could say acting strangely. so that. john cage. composer. suddenly. in 1935. a newspaper in
(in fact john cage or his equivalent could also get up from his chair and why not dance a few steps at the same time as rustling the newspaper)
his hands. in the waiting room of a new york city doctor. discovers the musical possibilities. flabbergasting to say the least. flabbergasting to say the least. of a simple newspaper, though indeed a thick one. indeed a thick one. but. still. the same as. the same as any other. so that. so that. people quickly start noticing. in the waiting room. that something. they don’t know what. in 1935 they don't know what. to say the least. is bothering john cage. not an article in the newspaper. the cousin of mrs cage will say. but i know it’s strange but i owe it to myself to tell you. i can’t not tell you. my dear. the cousin
(in this way a rhythmic structure that mixes crumpling paper tearing newspaper tapping feet moving bodies can emerge little by little stop start again more and more frenetically)
of mrs cage will say. to mrs cage. in person. in person. but something coming from the newspaper itself as if. what do you know. as if. john cage was. suddenly. absorbed by something from the newspaper itself. your husband. your husband. now really. the cousin of mrs cage. will say. later. to mrs cage her cousin. in a café on 5th avenue. so that. in the waiting room. what do you know. it’s as if a chill settles over the patients. in fact a black hole. while doctor williams. what do you know. has the next patient come in his office. a little old man with bushy eyebrows. he’s suffering from a tumor on his left hip. he limps as he goes in to see doctor williams. in his office. and. while the entrance of doctor williams could have. at least. brought john cage back to himself. the composer. the man literally fascinated. really. by. you could say. the great musical potential of the newspaper. to the point that. nothing. not even doctor williams coming into the waiting room. not even doctor williams coming into the waiting room. judiciously. you could say judiciously. could break. you could say. the ambiance. the atmosphere in the waiting room. the bad atmosphere. that is because. of him. of him i insist. of john cage in person. the individual suffering. in 1935. from a black hole in his head. to the point where he has to
(in fact it would be funny if john cage or his equivalent were 2 or even 3 a whole game of mimics of looks of relations could therefor take place)
go. on the insistence of mrs cage. to see doctor williams. to see doctor williams. unfortunately also the doctor of a cousin of mrs cage. a curly blond. that day she makes one of her 3 weekly visits to doctor williams. maybe she is secretly in love with doctor williams. i think she is secretly in love with doctor williams. john cage will say. the man who. apparently. apparently. when he is left alone in the waiting room with the blond and curly
(in the end it's up to john cage or his equivalent to decide)
cousin from new york city. didn't even notice doctor williams coming in then the doctor going out accompanied this time by a housewife and her daughter who is sniffling and coughing. she is 5 years old. she's wearing white tights. she must have the whooping-cough. she doesn't notice mr cage. the strange circus of mr cage. now alone in the waiting room. alone with me. says the cousin. later. to mrs cage. over a hot chocolate. somewhere in a fancy café on 5th avenue. right after coming home from her visit to the doctor she calls her cousin. she calls the apartment of mr and mrs cage. it’s mrs cage who answers. they set a meeting for that afternoon. somewhere on 5th avenue. in a fancy café. she has no problem telling mrs cage how strange she found the behavior of john cage. that morning. in the waiting room of doctor williams. a newspaper in his hands. she says it over a hot chocolate. here they serve it in big tall and straight glasses. here they serve it with lots of milk foam. it’s the favorite place of mrs cage and her cousin to meet. here they can keep. in 1935. their hats on. and. so. they keep them on. so that. when doctor williams goes out of the waiting room with the cousin of mrs cage. what do you know. john cage is left in the waiting room alone.
(yes each one can decide depending on what they know how to do in fact depending on what they’re comfortable with, etc. yes really)
continues alone the unique and magnificent really magnificent experience that. for the past hour or so. he has been experimenting with. so that. john cage. exhausted. literally. physically. by the intense concentration that what do you know this kind of experience necessitates. what do you know. ends up by. you could say. coming out of his black hole. coming out of his black hole. and. and leaves the waiting room. so that's what was in bud. john cage tells himself. when he’s outside. when he’s in the street. that’s all it was. nothing at all. really nothing at all to worry about. john cage tells himself. taking a magazine with him. and 2 or 3 newspapers. impatient to continue at home. a new york city apartment. his experiences. good thing he didn’t see the doctor. the good doctor williams. what could he have told him. good thing he was right not to worry mrs cage. john cage tells himself. returning home quickly. at a brisk pace. his home. on the 3rd floor.",fr_XX,en_XX,"a doctor's visit
(In the course of his experience in the waiting hall with the doctor john cage or his equivalent will size will be stocked with a day that he will maniple from far to far in the actual experience)
it's in 1935. we're a doctor williams' home. we have a county of mme cage at the doctor williams' home. it's a county of mme cage. it's a county of new york city. it's going to that era. it's in 1935. it's only 3 times a week at the doctor's home. the good doctor williams. it's hold a cabinet in the neighbor of the appart of john cage. it's also the doctor of john cage. when john cage. one day.. decides to go to the doctor's home due to. say. it's due to something that bells. let's put a black hole in the head. that's it. it's it. one day john cage. it's a black hole in the head. it's
(In actuality, it will be expedient to perfect a sort of choregraphy or musical coin where we'll see john cage or its other first to manipulse the journal like each other each other each other do it just turn the pages what)
Then decides to go to the doctor williams' office. At first, in his waiting hall. A little 10 m2 making machine, there are placed 5 chairs, 1 table of magazines and days. There's there. Will say john cage. Will say john cage. At later, all that it necess to have fun. Will say john cage. The compositor. A man like you and me. They stay one day in the doctor williams' office. He says the county of a mme cage on a beach. Then he stays in the doctor williams' office, just nexter to her. And three other clients are like magazines. They waiting to spend to the doctor's office. The good doctor williams. And. Which makinally john cage. just to have something in hand. just to have something in hand. Take one.

as troublé le vieux jeu de l’âme

quel bonheur te voir surmarcher
mon territoire, échanger quelques mots
insignifiants de passe avec les nains
du jardin. les figures humaines s’étaient tues
dans la partie construite du domaine
à la frontière à peine un vieillard retenait-
il l’attention en tranchant la queue d’une banane
affublée d’un code-barre avec un couteau suisse.
oui, dès la première sensation
la face visible annonce la couleur
le code du jour : la nature
de son lien avec la cachée. cela se passe
ici, non pas dans le « non-dit »
mais entre les vues du moment
du quartier tout à fait fidèles
et ce qu’elles couvrent qu’il faut dire.
un vérin hydraulique soutient la galerie
je m’y appuie, j’éprouve sa résistance
à chaque ligne. chaque ligne mesure
la distance entre le décor
constat que l’on dresse et son ombre
inventaire que l’on couche par écrit –
entre la sensation aiguë et le sentiment latent, entre
entre. or cette proportion capricieuse qui règle
mon débit maladif, le rythme, le débite
avait gelé dans les lieux familiers. tout un pan
gagné par le désert et ses nuits froides
et son vent-fou-que-nul-n’écoute-impunément.
le même manège : regards d’habitués qui s’évitent
préfèrent se rendre la monnaie des paroles de profil
murs et chaussée lustrés par la rêverie
pour la rêverie, sketches mille fois répétés
devant une assemblée de chaises. entrant tu
as troublé le vieux jeu de l’âme
et du paysage. l’air que tu déplaces en marchant
a regonflé les figures de cartes d’ici.

non ? de quoi parlait le téléfilm hier soir ?
même pas compris si c’était un docudrama
ou quoi. – oui, tout se mêle ce matin

dosages inégaux de soleil, passants, voitures, ciment
que rien ne lie sinon l’analogie dont la raison
fuit dans la vue suivante. – au moins j’espère
qu’en les cousant tu cernes un peu mieux
ce qu’elles couvrent dans ta pauvre petite tête.

alors j’ai bien besoin de toi pour avancer
d’une comparaison à l’autre ironiquement
naïvement dans cette lumière indirecte
cette « réalité » qui se cite elle-même
et se distance. car derrière elle, loin derrière
la réalisme et l’imagination piétinent

that happens
here
between the acute sensation and the latent feeling
entering you
troubled the old game of both soul
and landscape
so i really need you if i’m to advance.
what joy to see you walking over
my territory, exchanging a few
insignificant words in passing with the garden
gnomes. human figures had become silent
in the constructed part of the domain
on the boundary an aged man barely held
anyone’s attention as he cut the end off a banana
bearing a barcode with a swiss penknife.
yes, from the first sensation
the visible side announces the colour
the code of the day: the nature
of its link with what’s hidden. that happens
here, not in the ‘un-said’
but between the views of the moment
of the area all completely accurate
and what they cover up is what must be said.
a hydraulic jack supports the gallery
i lean on it, i test its resistance
on each line. each line measures
the distance between the décor
the record set up and its shadow
inventory you lay down in writing –
between the acute sensation and the latent feeling, enters
between. but this capricious proportion that rules
my unhealthy flow, rhythms it, gets it going
had frozen in the usual places. a whole area
invaded by the desert and its cold nights
and its mad-wind-that-no-one-listens-to-expecting-to-get-away-with-it.
the same set-up: the gaze of regulars who avoid each other
preferring to hand back the change of words in profile
walls and floor polished darkly by daydreams
for daydreams, sketches rehearsed a thousand times
before an audience of chairs. entering you
troubled the old game of both soul
and landscape. the air you displace when you walk
has re-swollen the card figures that belong here.
– that leaves us with quite a lot of images
doesn’t it? what was last night’s tv drama about?
i didn’t even get if it was a docudrama
or something else. – yes, everything’s getting muddled up this morning
or rather juxtaposed, one view bang another
unequal doses of sun, passers-by, cars, cement
that nothing links except the analogy whose logic
vanishes into the next vision. – i hope at least
that when sewing them together you understand more clearly
what they’re hiding in your poor little head.
– in two words i call that the sentimental
so i really need you if i’m to advance
from one comparison to the other ironically
naively in this indirect light
this ‘reality’ that quotes itself
and moves away. because behind it, far behind
realism and imagination stand around
in a mortal docudrama. – that’s all?
– that’s all, i’ve said too much, it’s your fault.
now let’s change terrace
let’s look for silence but outside.",fr_XX,en_XX,"a defensive of poetry

between the acuity sensation and the lazy sentiment

What happiness to see you walking away
my territory, to exchange a few words
Insignificant pass with the dwarves
from the garden. The human figures had killed

Or what. – Yes, everything mixes this morning

its output, its sweetness and fury
heard, all in knots and taken away,
flags me down, the days passing in our footsteps,
nowhere is my country today
i've been banished from the one that,
whose trees have disappeared,
far from here and now,
cedars, birches, baobabs, beeches,
oaks, lindens, cherries, weeping willows,
some evening the earth,
dry and humid, acidic, alkaline,
neutral,

from now on from my country
we go toward, and toward
we don't know what we'll find for ourselves
the days passing in our steps
as the passing forests, plains, mountains and banks
and the beaches, bare and discovered, to be discovered;
at the river's threshold, where a fossilized whale,
its baleen of stone, its granite organ
leaves us fragile on the feet of its sheer face
find, before the night, the vital refuge,
some men and women,
fire,
they insist, and take us back
a wood's edge, then the woods, in the hunting blind
from the woods the noises are immense,
terrifying, bestial, beasts and men, women and chimeras,
barbarians, possible,
possible,
the forest, the undergrowth,
the chiaroscuro, the diagonal mounting
of light and insects,
incantations to, what do i know,
fear rises
from, what do i know; that's what fear is
in the hunting blind
and, those four
protect me,
we walk, and
i, trumpets & songs, invisible, we rise, the light falls,
and from the inert bodies of my companions, their voices, united, over
a single chord, are still, cry and call to me, i
rise up, hear them, disappearing

its output, its sweetness and fury
heard, all in knots and taken away,

in the air, suspended, walk,
like i've never ever walked before
feeling the ground that is not,
any longer, beneath my feet,
i
above the forest
the forest given to my eye, dizziness, dizziness
of the mountains, of the unspooling plains, and
i walk, the stars i touch them
and the moon and

in the rocky and glistening silence
of the stars

we are given back to each other

allows me to see her, the mist and the light,
born in the east, of the sun,
slit it, uncover it,
gaseous and watery,
veil, open, fold, and drape
the elsewhere the nowhere and the unknown.
the mysterious night, where does it come from,
fly off to, powdery, the beaten earth of the path,
it moves ahead, clarifies
its demand, he asks her, asks me to
come find her, come here, where she stays
immobile in movement,
approaches, toward me,
knowing of me that it's me
her hand on my shoulder and her smile,
which comes to find her, to lead her away,

sleeping, its details craggy
in the frosty morning air,

where my old master jaguar,
waits, awaits her,

silently, we
in the city, walk on toward,
what she knows, what she doesn't know,

awaits him, where, the threshold surpassed, only she goes in,

a hummingbird-man
a spider-monkey-man
a deer-woman
a boa-man

sprained, exploses, a lake is emptyed, I am a lake and a fontain, indivisible and

neuvième heure s’empare de mon âme l’étrangère
s’acheminant dans l’hiver et la faim blême
au pas d’une porte là tu te plies dans la nuit
pour consulter ta vie celle transcrite
celle où tu grelottais d’aimer si fort
devant la porte close mesurais les heures
tu ne savais comment découvrir ton âme
ni accueillir la peine dans le cœur délaisse
passe la douzième heure consulte sa mémoire
pour en saisir encore l’agonie
revoir la mise en scène d’un désir décédé
le matin les surprenait écumant et rose
par la fenêtre bleue le corps gonfle de joie
et la belle endormie le jour l’étrangère
etrangere corps scarifie âme bleue
elle s’offre tourbillon au comble de l’été
légère la vague éclate à la face du ciel
bénis les cœurs dilates dans la lumière
cœurs égares dans la blanche maison là
bas en bordure de la mer où dansent des rayons
il y avait une garde secrète familière
cette impatience /lustres l’été
commençant été il allait finir tel
enfer des rêves exprimes
inaccomplis ne reste que la tension sourde
des cœurs ballottes de gares routières en
paradis cœurs éblouis dans le merveilleux
instant d’abandon inconnu étrange bleue
bleue la transe emporte l’âme incandescente
loin de la ville où se pavanent nos rêves lourds
d’avoir rêvé à haute voix échangé
leurs secrets au grand jour c’est la jument borâq
elle s’élève ailée ivre et tremble de s’approcher
elle me regarde dans l’âme et l’âme silencieuse
vainement le cœur ravive l’empreinte effacée
voilà qu’à nouveau ta vie s’étend dans le vide
dans l’œil qui cerne la tristesse de la bête
que tu interroges elle ne répond pas
à terre le ciel manteau qui couvre mal
le soir c’est un saignement elle reste muette
transportée dans le vide de son âme guérie
se confond avec sa veine incandescente
incandescente mon âme / …incandescente/ aurore
dans la paume de l’aurore cœur aimant
un galet se fendille comme aimant
sur la grève l’aurore distingue une intaille
remous roses et caresses portent le cœur à l’âme
aurores successives auront poli la texture
d’où vient que la nacre s’y dépose étincelle
au premier rai sur la grève parmi les galets
celui-là seul dresse au soleil dans le blanc
de l’été – vis-à-vis des chansons – terrasses
une saison nos âmes sont blanches de feu
sur la terrasse aveugle se réjouissent chaux vive
vagues et brises murmurent dans le bleu de l’intaille
ton regard /écho à la mer cœur aurore
aurore une puis l’autre les cordes lâchent celles noueuses
de maléfices… réintègrent l’œil bas le repaire
lorsque les deux amants se réveillent il fait grand jour
dans le secret de leur âme la table est servie
j’ai bien dormi /dit-il/ tu dors très bien /dit-elle/
c’est bon quand l’amour est violent comme tu le fais
je n’ai rien fait dit-il c’est un coup du destin
ce n’est pas mon corps et nous allons en mourir
pour l’instant les deux lits étaient joints la fenêtre
donnait dans le rêve à venir rose bleu et musc
l’été dans son apogée les enchantait
ce décor tombe les âmes sans cœur
se tourmentent à l’écoute la romance dénouée
et celles dans l’aurore au guet déjà mains noueuses","state ii
ninth hour the stranger takes hold of my soul
making its way in winter and hunger pale
at a doorstop there you bend over in the night
to consult your life the one transcribed
the one where you shivered from loving so
before the closed door you counted the hours
you didn’t know how to discover your soul
nor to welcome sorrow in the abandoned heart
past the twelfth hour consults its memory
to grasp again the agony
to see once more the setting of a desire deceased
the morning surprised them foamy and rose
through the blue window the heart swollen with joy
and the lovely sleeping one the day the stranger
stranger scarred body blue soul
she offers herself tornado at the height of the summer
lightly the wave splashes in the face of the sky
blessed the hearts dilated in the light
hearts lost somewhere in the white house over
there at the edge of the sea where the rays dance
there was a secret familiar guard
this impatience /candelabra summer
beginning summer it was going to end a
hell of the dreams told
unaccomplished there remains only the dulled tension
of the hearts tossed about in the bus stations in
paradise hearts dazzled in the marvelous
instant of unknown abandon strange blue
blue the trance bears away the incandescent soul
far from the town where our heavy dreams strut
from having dreamed aloud exchanged
their secrets in broad daylight it’s the borâq mare
she rises winged tipsy and trembles at coming closer
she looks in my soul and the silent soul
vainly the heart brings back to life the imprint effaced
look how once more your life stretches forth into the void
in the eye which envelops the sadness of the beast
whom you question she doesn’t reply
on the earth the sky a cloak scarcely covering
the evening something’s bleeding she stays silent
transported in the emptiness of her soul healed
mingling with her vein incandescent
incandescent my soul / …incandescent/ dawn
in the dawn’s palm loving heart
a pebble splits open as if loving
on the sand dawn singles out a gem
rose tremors and caresses bear the heart to the soul
successive dawns will have polished the texture
how is it that the mother of pearl settles there spark
at the first ray upon the sand among the pebbles
this one alone standing in the sun in the white
of summer – facing the songs – terraces
a season our souls are white with fire
on the blind terrace are rejoicing limestone
waves and breezes murmuring in the blue of the gem
your gaze /echoing the sea heart dawn
dawn one then the other the cords slip those knotted
with evil spells… reintegrate the eye low the repair
when the two lovers wake up it is broad daylight
in the secret of their soul the table is set
i slept well /he says/ you sleep very well /she says/
it’s good when love is violent as you make it
i did nothing he says it’s a trick of fate
it’s not my body and we shall die from it
for the moment the two beds were joined the window
opened on the dream to come rose blue and musk
the summer at its apogee enchanted them
this setting once struck the souls without a heart
torment each other in listening to the romance unknotted
and those in the dawn watching already knotted hands",fr_XX,en_XX,"well, well, well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well

walking in the winter and fame blooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
At the steep of a door there you turn into the night
to see your life the transcribed
The one where you were crying to love so strong
in front of the closed door, I was believing the hours
You didn't know how to discover your soul
not to accept pain in the heart abandons
pass the tweteth hour see his memory
to see the agony of it again
To see the stage of a dead desire
In the morning surprised them ecumulant and rose
by the blue window the body blows with joy
And the beautiful sleeping the strange day
Estrengere body scarishes blue soul
it gives it to the mind of the summer
Slightly the wave burns at the face of the sky
Bless the dilate hearts in the light
hearts missweet in the white house there
down by the sea where rays dance
There was a familiar secret guard
this impatience / show the summer
begining summer it would end like
Hell of dreams expressed
Inaccomplied only the deaf tension
from hearts to bus stations in
paradise dazzling hearts in the wonderful
It's a moment of abandoning unknown strange blue
blue the trance takes the incandescent soul
far from the city where our heavy dreams start
for having dreamed with aloud voice spoken
Their secrets in the great day is the boron ass
she gets up intoxicate and fears to come up
she looks at me in the soul and the silent soul
Vainly the heart relives the erased impression
here is that your life lives again in the empty
In the eyes that ends the sadness of the beast
that you question, she doesn't answer
On the earth, the sky, the dress, which weakly dresses
At evening it's a blooding it stays much
shipped in the empty of her healed soul
Is confused with its incandescent vein
Incandescent my soul / ...incandescent / aurora
in the palm of the dawn loved heart
a peaper crasses like love
On the short, the dawn diserts an ink
rose rains and caresses carrying the heart to the soul
The suffering auroras will have polished the texture
Where does the nace depose in it sparkles
at the first ray on the scream of the screams
it's the one up in the sun in the white
summer – vis-à-vis songs – terraces
one season our souls are white of fire
on the wind terrace rejoy the live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live l
waves and breams blow in the blue of the ink
your look /echo to the sea aurora heart
auror one and the one, the corners leave the crazy
of worries... reintegrate your eyes down the bedroom
when the two lovers wake up it's bad day
in the secret of their soul the table is served
I sleep well /he says / you sleep well /he says /
It's good when love is violent as you do
I didn't do anything he said it's a coup of destiny
it's not my body and we're gonna die of it
for the moment, the two beds were enjoined the window
was giving in the dream to come blue rose and much
the summer in his apogee enchanted them

The romance unknown is hurling at theirself
And them in the dawn with the watch already weaking hands"

a première vue, ce ne sont que des jeux incohérents. des remplissages grotesques. un non-sens exhibé. voire une impression de platitude. des variations formelles pour le plaisir d’une élite. un élixir ! le lecteur d’aujourd’hui s’ennuie devant la complexité des techniques mises en œuvre. il n’entend rien à toutes ces expérimentations délurées du langage. les journaux lui parlent autrement. chaque jour une catastrophe nouvelle le plonge dans l’angoisse. du sang éclabousse les récits rapportés. une trame d’éléments imprévisibles où se discernent mal les fils d’or de la broderie.
ii.
la contrainte exercée fausse la syntaxe. des décalages s’insinuent dans la distorsion du vocabulaire. la narration n’obéit à aucune causalité. les événements se succèdent à l’identique. cela amuse quelques stylistes qui voient là une liberté exemplaire. mais les jongleries ne parviennent pas à faire taire les ventres creux. on se heurte de partout à un sens douteux. on cherche les mots qui tranchent pour avoir le dessus. en réalité les choix restent restreints. les noms prédominent sur les verbes et les adjectifs. toponymes terribles. obscénités ciselées. blasphèmes irrémédiables. scatologie malsaine. noms d’animaux ou de gens répugnants. désignations de certaines parties du corps. tout ça grouille dans une trivialité qui provoque un léger dégoût.
iii.
ça frise la polyphonie macabre. on ne s’écoute plus au milieu du tableau. chacun trouve son compte dans l’affaire, dit-il. mais le compte n’est pas bon. il ne s’agit pas d’un simple trait de plume. tu vois combien le moindre mot pèse sur la langue. le débusquer n’a pas été de tout repos. tu souffres devant les contradictions du lexique avec l’espoir de plus en plus réduit de trouver une issue. la parole n’est jamais libre ni profuse malgré les signes d’ouverture. c’est un saignement qui ne tarit pas. un couleur locale sans l’emphase du temps.

ii.
the practiced constraint falsifies syntax. intervals insinuate themselves into the distortion of the vocabulary. the narrative obeys no causality. events follow each other without any change. this amuses some stylists who see in it an exemplary freedom. but such juggling is incapable of silencing the empty bellies. everywhere one bumps into a dubious meaning. one looks for words with an edge to get the upper hand. in fact, the choices remain limited. the nouns prevail over the verbs and adjectives. terrible toponyms. chiseled obscenities. irremediable blasphemies. unhealthy scatologies. repugnant names of animals or people. earmarking of certain body parts. all of which teems in a triviality that provokes a slight disgust.

"hopkins forest
j’étais sorti
prendre de l’eau au puits, auprès des arbres,
et je fus en présence d’un autre ciel.
disparues les constellations d’il y a un instant encore,
les trois quarts du firmament étaient vides,
le noir le plus intense y régnait seul,
mais à gauche, au-dessus de l’horizon,
mêlé à la cime des chênes,
il y avait un amas d’étoiles rougeoyantes
comme un brasier, d’où montait même une fumée.
je rentrai
et je rouvris le livre sur la table.
page après page,
ce n’étaient que des signes indéchiffrables,
des agrégats de formes d’aucun sens
bien que vaguement récurrentes,
et par-dessous une blancheur d’abîme
comme si ce qu’on nomme l’esprit tombait là, sans bruit,
comme une neige.
je tournai cependant les pages.
bien des années plus tôt,
dans un train au moment où le jour se lève
entre princeton junction et newark,
c’est-à-dire deux lieux de hasard pour moi,
deux retombées des flèches de nulle part,
les voyageurs lisaient, silencieux
dans la neige qui balayait les vitres grises,
et soudain,
dans un journal ouvert à deux pas de moi,
une grande photographie de baudelaire,
toute une page
comme le ciel se vide à la fin du monde
pour consentir au désordre des mots.
j’ai rapproché ce rêve et ce souvenir
quand j’ai marché, d’abord tout un automne
dans des bois où bientôt ce fut la neige
qui triompha, dans beaucoup de ces signes
que l’on reçoit, contradictoirement,
du monde dévasté par le langage.
prenait fin le conflit de deux principes,
me semblait-il, se mêlaient deux lumières,
se refermaient les lèvres de la plaie.
la masse blanche du froid tombait par rafales
sur la couleur, mais un toit au loin, une planche
peinte, restée debout contre une grille,
c’était encore la couleur, et mystérieuse
comme un qui sortirait du sépulcre et, riant:
‘non, ne me touche pas’, dirait-il au monde.
je dois vraiment beaucoup à hopkins forest,
je la garde à mon horizon, dans sa partie
qui quitte le visible pour l’invisible
par le tressaillement du bleu des lointains.
je l’écoute, à travers les bruits, et parfois même,
l’été, poussant du pied les feuilles mortes
d’autres années, claires dans la pénombre
des chênes trop serrés parmi les pierres,
je m’arrête, je crois que ce sol s’ouvre
a l’infini, que ces feuilles y tombent
sans hâte, ou bien remontent, le haut, le bas
n’étant plus, ni le bruit, sauf le léger
chuchotement des flocons qui bientôt
se multiplient, se rapprochent, se nouent
– et je revois alors tout l’autre ciel,
j’entre pour un instant dans la grande neige.","hopkins forest
i had gone out
to get some water at the well by the trees,
and i was in the presence of another sky.
disappeared was the constellations of a moment before,
three quarters of the firmament was empty,
the most intense black reigned there alone,
but to the left, above the horizon,
mixed with the top of the oaks,
there was a cluster of glowing stars
like a blazing fire, from which even a cloud of smoke rose.
i went back in
and i re-opened the book on the table.
page after page,
there were only indecipherable marks,
aggregates of forms with no meaning
although vaguely recurring,
and underneath a bottomless whiteness
as though what one calls the mind fell there, noiselessly,
like snow.
i nevertheless turned the pages.
many years before
in a train at the moment of daybreak
between princeton junction and newark,
that is, two accidental places for me.
two arrows fallen to earth from nowhere,
the travellers were reading, silent
in the snow that was sweeping across the grey windows,
and suddenly,
in an open newspaper a couple of feet away from me,
a big photograph of baudelaire,
a whole page
as the sky empties at the end of the world
to agree to the disorder of the words.
i drew together this dream and the memory
when i walked, first all one autumn
in woods where soon it was the snow
that triumphed, in many of those signs
that we receive, contradictorily,
from the world devastated by language.
the conflict of two principles came to an end,
it seemed to me, two lights mingled,
the edges of the wound healed.
the white mass of cold fell in bursts
onto colour, but a roof in the distance, a painted
plank leaning against a railing,
it was still colour, and mysterious,
like one who would emerge from the tomb and, cheerful:
‘no, don't touch me,’ he would say to the world.
i really owe a lot to hopkins forest,
i keep it on my horizon, in its part
that abandons the visible for the invisible
by the quivering of the blue of the distance.
i listen to it, through the noises, and sometimes even,
in the summer, scuffing the dead leaves
of other years, vivid in the half-light
of the oak trees that are too dense among the stones,
i stop, i think that this ground opens
to the infinite, that these leaves fall there
without haste, or else go back up, the high, the low
no longer being, nor the noise, except the light
whisper of the flakes that soon
increase, get closer, join together,
– and then i see again all the other sky,
i enter for an instant into the big snow.",fr_XX,en_XX,"Hopkins forest

les jardins suspendus de tes joies et
accrocher des oiseaux – oiseaux d’argent – et des lunes taillés d’or aux branches des sommeils pourpres.

about those few words embroidered with snow, which
wander from the point.
i wanted to be quiet,
to be here – to be far,
in a body of suspended summers –
for your summers which live in me.
i wanted to think of white dawns, their heart – red – of snow,
i wanted to think your fury – white – on the grasshoppers of the breaking skies, of the skies that depart, that empty.
and of rains, rains, red rains
of snow

the white cities, the floating cities, the deep cities, the cities that don’t exist at the foot of the high red towers of your stormy rages that smell of red currants.

i wanted to think about moons
of wounded moons, of dropped moons, of snowdrop moons,
of moons of blood

i wanted to believe in suns of ink to crown your escapes.
i wanted to drink the suns; to be cold, wakeful.
i wanted to spit the moons: to burn cold.
i wanted to bewitch
the gardens of ochre joys and without refuge,
the hanging gardens of your joys and
to attract birds – silver birds – and moons carved of branched gold
of purple sleep.
i wanted to think the rooms,
the rooms asleep on the golden grasshoppers, the rooms where your footsteps awake,
to be there; to be far away.
to look, to see nothing.
to listen; to hear nothing.
to plunge my fingers; to soak.
to touch; to hold back nothing

for the birds of your rage.

At the feet of the high and red rounds of your storm rages that feel the small.

Injured moons, perceived moons, moons-perceived snows,
Moons of blood
for your nights that leave faces, hands, and lands, for your desert and ocre nights.
I wanted to believe in the ink suns to courn your flows.
I wanted to drink the suns; be cold, awaken.
I wanted to scream the moons: burn cold.
I wanted to bring
Gardens with ocear joys and no refuge,
the gardens stopped with your joys and
to hoist birds – money birds – and moneys gilded with gold to the brains of purple sleeps.
I wanted to think the halls,
The sleeprooms on the gold wills, the halls where your steps wake up,
To be here; to keep me far away.
To look, to see nothing.
listen; don't hear anything.
dive my fingers; discember.
touch; don't hoist anything

à mobilité réduite malentendante de couleur.

et cet autre : l’histoire en crue a tout noyé

rédigent une thèse sur les poubelles. – mais que fait
ce bébé sur un toit ? comment est-il arrivé là ?
toi qui t’intéresses aux voix tu dis
qu’il s’agit de lui mettre un nom dessus. je laisse
ce soin à noé quand il passe
à l’heure des éboueurs. le devoir m’appelle : retracer
la sombre histoire sous-marine qui n’explique rien
mais fait le lien. c’est arrivé entre deux ombres
sous la ligne dure du contraste. la danseuse
du paquet de tabac bleu aurait dû se douter
qu’on ne cherche pas impunément un billet en boule
à la lueur des réverbères dans un film de ce genre.
ses pas résonnent, s’arrêtent, résonnent
et le crime a eu lieu hors champ. on n’y a vu
que du feu. trop tard pour mettre un mot

son nom de scène dans le sommeil. le mien
fut donc produit par val lewton. est-elle

"le sport favori de l’homme
aucune preuve
que nous avancions

s’est insinué
c’est là
que j’ai admis qu’une bonne chose pouvait n’être pas bonne
tu dis
que le bonheur est une chose et la tristesse
une autre compatibles
passons.
alors ? heureuse ? je plaisantais.
nous roulions maintenant sur le plat
entre deux caissons lumineux de jungle
nous sentions l’écurie. avant même
que nous nous soyons retournés, sondés l’un l’autre
une foule d’étudiants en délire réclamerait
nos premières impressions. – ce périple
n’a pas de valeur scientifique. aucune preuve
que nous avancions. il est bien sorti quelque chose
de la mousse grâce à l’hygrométrie extravagante
de ces régions et de leurs eaux
si profuses qu’elles crachent des poissons en manque de leurres
hélas nous sommes de piètres mycologues
et notre art de la pêche est tout livresque.
nous repérons d’intéressants échantillons
de lave dans les vitrines poussiéreuses
nous les obtenons à bas prix seulement
il ne nous vient pas à l’idée de les faire fondre
pour en extraire le pendule, le message abrégé.
ah nous formons un beau couple quand l’un
rattrape l’autre. le doute
s’est insinué – tu t’en souviens ? –
lorsque nous avons débouché dans cette forêt de coulemelles.
tu étais un peu décoiffée, j’avais toujours
ma casquette à rabats, mon veston
et mes knickerbockers en tweed avec des sangles de cuir.
– fameux, dis-je et toi sur la pointe des pieds
pour atteindre la bague l’arrière-goût acre t’avertit
de la présence du venin. la prise, d’ailleurs,
n’était pas très réglementaire. – je me rappelle
le peu de crédit accordé par le savant en herbe
que j’étais à ma mère quand elle m’appliqua l’expression
des yeux plus gros que le ventre. nous fûmes
punis de notre folie des grandeurs
par où nous avions péché mais dans l’infiniment petit
en chopant une mycose purulente. c’est là
que j’ai admis qu’une bonne chose pouvait n’être pas bonne
et je n’en suis pas revenu.
dire qu’il a fallu pour ça
libres et encordés, livrés
l’un à l’autre descendre
jusqu’au centre de la terre
où les musées sont fermés, les bus ne circulent plus
et gicler aux antipodes
sur un lit de coquille. enfin
le paysage est inchangé, l’épicier se fait un devoir
de nous parler comme s’il nous avait vu la veille.
– juste un léger flottement
entre ciel et sous-sol, je n’appellerais pas
ça le plancher des vaches. bien sûr
je savais que tu as une âme
et des états. tu dis
que le bonheur est une chose et la tristesse
une autre compatibles. il n’est pas de ma compétence.
l’ombre nous suit de ces iguanes
déguisés et grossis comme les amanites (des coulemelles!)
par un jeu de perspective : aucun danger.
le mot « réel » dans ta bouche ferme
la porte de service. tranquille, je le serai tout à fait
quand nous aurons mis quelques encablures
entre eux et lui. passons
à ta leçon de rattrapage d’anglais.
tu dis : it was a nice journey
je traduis : une bonne journée.","man\'s favorite sport
no proof
that we’re advancing
doubt
insinuated itself
that’s when
i admitted that a good thing might not be good
you say
that happiness is one thing and sadness
another the two compatible
let’s move on.
so? happy? i was joking.
we’re now driving on the flat
between two luminous crates of jungle
we’ve caught the scent of home. even before
we’d turned round, sounded each other out
a crowd of delirious students clamored for
our first impressions. – this voyage
has no scientific value. no proof
that we’re advancing. something definitely came out
of the foam thanks to the excessive hygrometry
of the region and its waters
so profuse that they spit fish lacking lures
alas we’re pathetic mycologists
and our art of fishing is purely academic.
we discover interesting samples
of lava in dusty shop windows
we obtain them at low prices but
don’t think of melting them down
to extract the pendulum, the abbreviated message.
ah we make a good couple when one
catches up with the other. doubt
insinuated itself – do you remember? –
when we ended up in that forest of parasol mushrooms.
your hair was in a bit of a mess, i still had
my cap with earflaps, my jacket
and my tweed knickerbockers with leather braces.
– first-rate, i said and you on tiptoe
to reach the ring the bitter aftertaste warned you
that it’s poisonous. the catch, what’s more,
didn’t really conform to the rules. – i remember
the minimal credit accorded by the budding scholar
i was to my mother when she said i had
eyes bigger than my stomach. we were
punished for our delusions of grandeur
that led us to sin but in an infinitely small way
catching a purulent mycosis. that’s when
i admitted that a good thing might not be good
and i never went back on it.
to say that for that it was necessary
free and bound tightly, given over
one to the other to descend
to the centre of the earth
where the museums are shut, buses no longer circulate
to be tossed out to the antipodes
on a shell bed. anyway
the landscape’s unchanged, the grocer makes it his duty
to speak to us as though he’d seen us yesterday.
– just a light fluttering
between sky and subsoil, i wouldn’t call

"vous êtes invités
la journée s’avance masquée
la sensation, la plus forte et la plus subtile
de l’aujourd’hui
la nuit
on y voit nus les rouages
l’encombrement du temps
on fait eau, on va droit
sur l’iceberg.
et la journée s’avance masquée
sur des rails trop étroits. décidément
elle ne fait pas son âge, ce qui ne veut pas dire
qu’elle est plus vieille. s’il suffisait de tendre
une petite glace en direction de la lumière trop forte
pour y lire à l’envers – quoi ? pas la vérité
tout de même. simplement le kilo de tomates
pèse un peu plus ou un peu moins. la rumeur
de la ville tend la perche de minute en minute
à la journée dans son chorus qui paraît frêle
par des riffs de cuivres huilés. l’arrangement
sent la sueur et le big band en smokings pathétiques
imite un orchestre classique. – si si, cette cotte de mailles
vous va, je vous jure, à ravir. – je ne dis pas
qu’elle jure, mais si on danse ? votre voisin de table
trouve la musique pas assez actuelle, il lit
les magazines. – alors dans trois ans tu n’aimeras
plus ce que tu aimes aujourd’hui. – non
ce n’est pas si simple. j’aime, dit le voisin, ce qui me donne
la sensation, la plus forte et la plus subtile,
comme un parfum traverse la salle sur des talons
aiguilles, de l’aujourd’hui. plus tard
quand je ferai sauter le bouchon je sais
(et ce savoir ajoute une tuile à mon plaisir
un peu vert pour l’instant) qu’elle sera là
millésimée. – je vois. ce genre de chose ne m’arrive
jamais, j’en ai peur, ou par la grâce de créatures
désespérément vaporeuses. l’eau qui bout juste
avant son ascension dans la cafetière, le soleil
quand il s’épand sur la moquette d’une propreté douteuse
la fourchette qui tintant contre l’étain
d’une boîte d’abats pour le chat le rend dingue.
par exemple. et cela, vous voyez, n’a pas grand-chose à voir
avec la culture. je ne lis plus. en tout cas
plus dans l’espoir de me sentir – comment ? sentir
tout court. il y a des gens qui mettent leurs polaroïds
au freezer ; ils vieillissent mal, c’est notoire, mais
ne prenez pas pour un désir de retarder l’effacement
celui de couleurs irréelles. iceberg, aurores boréales.
le temps ne coule incolore qu’à température
ambiante. dès que l’atmosphère coagule
ça pue l’huile de cuisson. le lave-vaisselle a fait
de fines croûtes étranges comme des fragments de météore
avec des restes plus humains. il y a des jours
comme ça. pour celui-ci ce sera tout
d’accord ? d’ailleurs la lumière soudain baisse
dans le bar, signal du changement de tarif
et l’heure d’été, une belle arnaque, blanchit
le larcin du soir en taxant le sommeil du matin.
– bonne nuit, dors bien mon amour. – si c’est un ordre
sache que je vais me mutiner. le capitaine est à fond de cale.
dans cette mélasse une chatte ne retrouverait pas ses petits
et le port de départ ni celui vers quoi nous voguons
n’est en vue. hier m’a posé un lapin. demain
demain (autant en emporte le vent)
est un autre jour. la nuit, quelle violence
inouïe, tu ne trouves pas ? tu dors.
non qu’elle évoque la mort, la solitude hantée
des enfants – ces pensées peupleraient l’insomnie –
mais on y voit nus les rouages de la veille.
sur le pont l’océan tout entier se change
en salle des machines et dans chaque tour de garde
la discontinuité amorphe des heures soumet
le mousse à la torture. s’il avait su ! pas une angoisse
intéressante, une à la heidegger, comme dit
cet ami qui ne dort plus : un bazar, un medley sadique
des plus mauvaises chansons sur radio nostalgie,
l’encombrement du temps. comprends-tu que l’on ait
bien envie de te réveiller, mon amour, de secouer
tes épaules pour te montrer ce qui se passe d’affreux ?
– qu’est-ce qu’il y a ? – on fait eau, on va droit
sur l’iceberg, et non, il n’y a rien à l’horizon, c’est bien
ce qui affole. le titanic, selon certaines sources,
n’aurait jamais coulé mais un autre navire
presque identique auquel des armateurs véreux
auraient donné son nom, comptant sur un naufrage sans morts
pour encaisser la prime. le titanic – le vrai –
mouillerait encore dans une rade paisible
on ne sait où. il existe une carte postale
montrant un paquebot à demi englouti – le cabiria
ou bien le caribbean – et cette légende en gras :
« vous êtes invités. » il s’agissait de l’inauguration
d’un restaurant. longtemps j’ai cherché à qui l’envoyer,
une femme certainement. j’avoue que je m’identifie
assez à ce bateau débaptisé privé de son big band
qui a coulé, coule encore dans nos têtes et
n’a pas coulé. surtout le soir : le soir
est si sentimental. j’ai toujours cette carte.
tu l’as gagnée à la sueur de ton sommeil.","you are invited
the day advances masked
the strongest subtlest feeling
of the day
the night
lays its mechanisms bare
the burden of time
water’s coming in, we’re heading straight
for the iceberg.
so the day advances masked
on very narrow rails. oh no,
it doesn’t look its age, which doesn’t mean
it’s older. were it enough to hold
a mirror to the overbearing light
to read back to front across it – what? not the truth
all the same. just that the kilo of tomatoes
weighs a bit more or a bit less. the hum
of the town directs the boom from one minute to the next
following the day’s chorus, frail-sounding
through riffs of oiled brass. the rendition
smells of sweat and the big band in ragged tails
mocks a classical orchestra. – no, no, that coat of mail
couldn’t suit you better, i swear. – i’m not saying
it clashes, but what if we dance? the man next to you
doesn’t find the music modern enough, he’s a magazine
reader. – so in three years you’ll no longer love
the things you love today. – no
it’s not that simple. i like, says your neighbor, things that give me
the strongest subtlest feeling
like a perfume crossing the room on stiletto
heels, of the day. later
when i pop the cork i know
(and this adds spice to my pleasure
a bit bland as yet) that it’ll be there
vintage. – i see. that sort of thing never happens
to me i’m afraid, or only thanks to desperately
vaporous creatures. water that boils just
before rising in the coffee pot, the sun
when it spills over the stained carpet
the fork clinking against the pewter
of a plate of scraps for the cat drives him nuts.
for example. and that, you see, doesn’t have much to do
with culture. i no longer read. well
no longer hoping to feel – what? to feel
quite simply. some people put their polaroids
in the freezer; they age badly, that’s obvious, but
don’t mistake the desire to postpone effacement
for that of unreal colours. iceberg, aurora borealis.
time only flows colorless at room
temperature. as soon as the atmosphere coagulates
it stinks of cooking oil. the dishwasher has made
thin scales as strange as fragments of meteorite
with more human remains. there are days
like that. that’ll be enough for this one
ok? anyway the light is falling suddenly
in the bar, signalling a change of tariff
and daylight saving time, what a con, launders
evenings loot by taxing morning sleep.
– good night, sleep well my love. – if that’s an order
rest assured i’ll mutiny. the captain’s at the back of the hold.
a cat couldn’t find her kittens in this murk
and neither the port we left nor the one we’re heading for
is visible. yesterday stood me up. tomorrow
tomorrow (gone with the wind)
is another day. night-time, what unexpected
violence, don’t you think? you’re sleeping.
not that it evokes death, the haunted solitude
of children – these thoughts will populate insomnia –
but it lays yesterdays mechanisms bare
on the deck the whole ocean transforms itself
into a machine room and at each lookout post
the amorphous discontinuity of hours tortures
the ships boy. if only he’d known! not an interesting
angst, heidegger-style, as
that sleep-deprived friend says: a shambles, a sadistic medley
of the worst songs on golden oldies am,
the burden of time. do you see that someone
longs to wake you, my love, to grasp
your shoulders to show you the dreadful things going on?
– what is it? – there’s water coming in, we’re heading straight
for the iceberg, and no, there’s nothing on the horizon, that’s just
the horror of it. some say the titanic
never sank, but another
almost identical ship, that its corrupt owner
sold its name, counting on a shipwreck with no dead
to cash in on the insurance. the titanic – the real one –
would still be anchored in some peaceful harbour
no-one knows where. a postcard exists
showing a half-sunk steamship – the cabiria
or perhaps the carribbean – with this caption in bold:
‘you are invited.’ it had something to do with the inauguration
of a restaurant. i wondered who to send it to for ages,
definitely a woman. i admit that i feel quite an affinity
with this renamed boat stripped of its big band
that sank, sinks still in our minds and
never sank. most often in the evening: evenings
are so sentimental. i still have that card.
you’ve earned it through the toil of your sleep.",fr_XX,en_XX,"you're invitees
The day's begging inside
the sensation, the strongest and the most subtly
of today
At night
we'll see the roads undressed
The encumbering of time
we're making water, we're going right
On the eceberg.
And the day's going in hide
on too sleek rails. Decisionally
she's not ageing, what don't mean
that she's older. If it sufficed to tend
a little ice in the direction of the light too strong
to read it backwards – what? no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
always. simply the kilo of tomatoes
Weighs a little more or a little less.
of the city tends the perch from minute to minute
at the day in his chorus that seems frail
by riffs of oiled coppers. the
feel the sweat and the big gang in pathetic tuxes
Imitates a classic orchesstre. – if, it is, this cotta of shirts
you're going, I swear, to enjoy. – I don't say
that swears, but if we dance? your table neighbor
finds music not actual, it beds
magazines. – so in three years you will never love
no more what you love today – no
it's not so simple. I love, the neighbor says, what gives me
the sensation, the strongest and the most subtly,
like a perfume traverses the hall on heels
rings, from today. later
I know when I'm making the cap up
(and this know adds a till to my pleasure
a little green for the moment) that she'll be here
I see. that sort of thing doesn't come to me
I'm never afraid of it, or by the grace of cries
Desperately vaporous. The water that just ends
before is ascension in the cafe, the sun
when it expanses on the carpet of doubtful cleanliness
The fork that inks on the tin
It's a box of cat cutters makes it crazy.
for e.g.. and that, you see, doesn't have a lot to see
with culture. I don't read. in any case
no more in the hope of feeling me – how? feeling
everything. There are people who put their polaroids
in the freezer; they age unwell, it's noticeable, but
do not take for a desire to retard erasure
The one of unreal colors. iceberg, boreal auroras.
Time flows colorless only at weather
ambient. As soon as the air coags
it smeezes the broiling oil. The dishwasher has made
of fine straws, like fragments of a meteo
with more human remains. There are days
it'll be everything for this one
All right? else the light suddenly falls
in the bar, signal of the change of fare
And the summer time, a beautiful snake, white
the evening lark by taxing the morning sleep.
– Good night, sleep well my love. – if it's an order
You know I'm going to mutiny. The captain's in high.
In this melass a cat wouldn't find his smalls
and the port of departure or the port to what we walk to
isn't in the view. yesterday put me a bunny. tomorrow
tomorrow (so much takes the wind)
is other day. night, what violence
Unforgettable, don't you think? You sleep.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
children – those thoughts would populate insomnia –
But we can see the winds of the next day.
on the bridge the whole ocean changes
In the machine hall and in every ring
the amorphic dispustinity of the hours submits
the moss to torture. if he had knowd! no anxiety
it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it

badest songs on nostalgia radio,
the encumbering of time. Do you understand that we have
I want to wake you up, my love, to fight
It's your shoulder to show you what's being afraid?
– What's there? – We're making water, we're going right
on the eceberg, and no, there's nothing on the horizon, it's fine
What matters. The titanic, by certain sources,
You wouldn't have drown anything but anything other ship
It's almost the same where see-shippers
would have given his name, counting on a deathless white
To take the bonus. Titanic – the real –
would still drown in a peaceful rade
We don't know where. There exists a postcard
showcasing a samely englouded paquebot – the cabiria
Or the caribean – and this legend in great :
""You are invited."" it was the owning
from a restaurant. Long time I looked for who toss it to,
a woman certainly. I admit I sign myself
enough to this debaptized boat deprived of his big band
who has flowed, still flows in our heads and
it didn't go down. it didn't go down. it didn't go down. it didn't go down. it didn't go down. it didn't go down in the night: it didn't go down. it didn't go down. it didn't go down. it didn't go down. it didn't go down in the night: it didn't go down. it didn't go down. it didn't go down. it didn't go down in the night: it didn't go down in the night: it didn't go down in the night: it didn't go down in the night
it's so romantic. I've always got this card.
You win it with the sweat of your sleep."
"ne coupez pas
c’est beau
de ne pas savoir d’où viennent les choses
les enchaînements secrets
sont plus fins
il est des intrigues
au milieu desquelles on oublie
le début, n’attend plus la fin
quelques instants encore
tout peut tout pénétrer.
ça commence comme ça, au milieu
d’une conversation : le marché a déjà fleuri
sur la place brûlant
l’étape des bourgeons
et pour appeler cette ville
venise il a fallu bien camoufler
l’infrastructure, placer
savamment des branchages
mikado sur la fosse d’orchestre.
les marchandises acheminées
par des convois sans phares
silencieusement la nuit
rivalisent avec la nature.
remboursez ! cependant c’est beau
de ne pas savoir d’où viennent les choses
ni les enfants et quand les ethnologues
se prennent pour des missionnaires
du planning familial
de pouffer avec les sauvages.
les enchaînements secrets
sont plus fins. si tu les saisis, les soulèves
par le cou comme les serpents
venimeux, les baguettes
enchevêtrées, beaucoup de phrases
sont compatibles. leur gueule
sous la pression des doigts s’ouvre incroyablement
si nécessaire, un autre tube
s’encastre et toute la plomberie
s’installe avec des joints liquides.
qu’est-ce qui donne ce matin
aux accidents bien ponctués
du marché, du café, du retour à la chambre noire
la cohésion d’un film? pas la musique
plaquée si redondante qui est la honte
du cinéma. une prosodie plutôt
improvisée qui fait aussi retour
sur soi nonchalamment. impossible de l’arracher
à son prétexte, elle va polluer
l’air, seul reste le film
sur les murs et la peau. brasse coulée :
un maillon entre deux mouvements
entre deux eaux caché. c’est comme ça
que cela commence, en cours de route. c’est plutôt ça
que je dis. – mais on n’y comprend rien
mon pauvre ami. – bon. il est des intrigues
au milieu desquelles on oublie
le début, n’attend plus la fin : les gangsters en cavale
se mettent en position de sumotori de papier
sur une estrade en carton mais c’est un simple cercle
tracé dans le sable de la plage. alors
des acolytes frappent le sol de leurs paumes :
eux ils s’ébranlent toujours figés, la bobine accélère
les spectateurs sur leur siège tremblent
jusqu’à ce que l’un d’eux transgresse
la ligne. du grand art. que peux-tu faire
de mieux aujourd’hui que d’élever
à la grandeur naturelle d’un jeu sa copie miniature ?
de minuscules fragments s’étirent
le véhicule qui nous dépanne tient par des élastiques.
cela eut lieu sans queue ni tête
au milieu du chemin
de notre mort. l’explorateur tardif
en pleine descente de l’orénoque ou l’amazone
est pris de fièvre, il voit paralysé glisser
un interminable serpent, l’embouchure lui paraît
aussi lointaine que la source. ou
assis au milieu d’un tronc d’arbre, tiens
il note que c’est un crocodile.
de telles choses arrivent dans la vie : à mi-course
dans la zone indécise où pour quelques instants encore
tout peut tout pénétrer – du moins veut-on le croire.
d’anonymes bienfaiteurs assurent la soudure
remplissent les cases vides des étals mais il faut
espérer que la nuit venue les godemichés s’adapteront
sur le harnais universel. c’est comme ça
que cela commence, comme ça
que je l’entends pourvu qu’un chef
ne s’avise pas de tapoter le pupitre de sa baguette
et que l’on n’arrête aucune date.","don’t cut the line
it’s wonderful
not to know where things come from
hidden sequences
are finer
there are intrigues
in the midst of which you forget
the beginning, no longer anticipate the end
for another moment or so
everything is penetrable.
it begins like that, in the middle
of a conversation: the market has already blossomed
in the burning hot square
the budding phase
and to call this town
venice it was necessary to camouflage
the infrastructure, to place
forks knowingly
spillikins over the orchestra pit.
the merchandise brought in
by convoys without headlights
silently at night
rivals nature.
give us our money back! yet it’s wonderful
not to know where things come from
not even children and when ethnologists
pose as missionaries
of family planning
to laugh with the savages.
hidden sequences
are finer. if you grasp them, lift them
by the neck like poisonous
snakes, sticks
entwined, many sentences
are compatible. their jaws
open so wide beneath the pressure of your fingers
if necessary, another tube
slots in and all the plumbing
gets going with liquid joints.
what is it that gives this morning
with its well-punctuated accidents
of the market, the café, the return to the dark-room
the cohesion of a film? not the music
stuck on top, redundant, the shame
of cinema. no, a prosody, improvised
perhaps which doubles back
on itself nonchalantly. impossible to tear it away
from its pretext, it will pollute
the air, the film alone remaining
on walls and skin. molded brass:
a link between two movements
hidden between two currents. that’s how
it begins, when the journey’s underway. that’s pretty much
what i mean. – but it makes no sense
my poor friend. – fine. there are intrigues
in the midst of which you forget
the beginning, no longer anticipate the end: gangsters on the run
place themselves like paper sumo wrestlers
on a cardboard platform but it’s just a circle
traced in the sand on the beach. so
their associates beat the ground with the flats of their hands:
they fall still rigid, the reel turns faster
the spectators tremble in their seats
until one of them crosses
the line. fine art. what could you do
today that would be better than to raise
the miniature to the real size of the game?
miniscule fragments stretch themselves out
the breakdown vehicle here to save us is held together with rubber bands.
that happened for no reason at all
on our journey
towards death. the tardy explorer
in mid descent of the orinoco or the amazon
develops a fever, paralysed he watches the sliding
of an interminable snake, the mouth seems
as distant as the source. or
sitting in the middle of a tree trunk, look
he remarks that it’s a crocodile.
such things happen in life: halfway through
in the ambiguous zone where for another moment or so

mais quand l’activité économique se déplaça à odessa, la ville déclina rapidement
et « pisz na berdyczów ! » est devenu : « écris a personne »
ou « laisse-moi tranquille ! »
il écrit « pisz na berdyczów » sur une feuille de papier et la fixe à sa porte
mais nul ne lit le polonais ici, les gens ne comprennent pas ce qu’il a voulu dire
alors on frappe, on sonne, on glisse des mots entre le battant et le parquet
on chuchote ou on crie, on parle rudement ou avec distinction
selon les circonstances
il n’a que faire des circonstances
« pisz na berdyczów ! »","‘pisz na berdyczów!’
“pisz na berdyczów!” that means “write to me at berdichev”
since all the merchants of poland, lithuania and russia
passed through berdichev, a main commercial and banking center of the region
but when commerce moved to odessa, the city went downhill quickly
and “pisz na berdyczów!” became “write to nobody!” or “leave me alone!”
he writes “pisz na berdyczów!” on a piece of paper and tacks it to his door
but no one reads polish here, people don’t understand what he means
so they knock, they ring the bell, they slide messages between the door and the
parquet
they whisper or they shout, they speak rudely or with distinction
according to the circumstance
what can you do under the circumstances?
“pisz na berdyczów!”",fr_XX,en_XX,"""Piz na berdyczow!"" is to say ""Write to me berdichev""
'cause all the polony, lithuania and russian merchants
passed by berdichev, o of the main commercial and banking centres of the region
But when the business moved to odessa, the city didnessed fastly
And ""piz na berdyczow!"" has become: ""Write to no one""
or, ""Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave me leave
it writes ""piz na berdyczow"" on a leave of weather and it start to his door
But no one reads the poland here, people don't understand what he wanted to say
So we know, we ring, we slip words between the beater and the parquet
we shout or shout, we talk rudely or with distinction
by the circumstances
it's all to do with the situation

"les allergies de monsieur néant
à un âge avancé monsieur néant devient allergique au thon ;
il le découvre par hasard
dans un restaurant italien du centre historique de la ville.
son visage s’enflamme, ses yeux sont injectés de sang
ses voisins de table reculent leur siège, effrayés,
réclament l’intervention d’un médecin,
mais monsieur néant refuse catégoriquement tout secours
et se dirige en titubant vers les toilettes
avant de s’effondrer la tête à l’intérieur de la cuvette.
il est à peine rétabli de sa première crise
qu’en survient une seconde,
plus forte encore,
qui le terrasse pendant plusieurs jours.
malgré une reconstitution minutieuse de ses aliment liquides
comme solides,
ne parvenant à aucune conclusion probante,
monsieur néant se demande si ce n’est pas l’environnement
qui a provoqué cette fois son malaise.
il soupçonne les pigeons du square où, quand le temps le
permet,
il descend lire le journal du soir,
le chat de sa voisine qui, mystérieusement, préfère son balcon
encombré de caisses vermoulues et de chaises mangées de
rouille
à celui, fleuri, de sa maîtresse
à moins qu’il ne s’agisse du cyprès moribond derrière le mur
du couvent des augustines,
dernier vestige d’un parc disparu.
puis lors d’une croisière sur le nil à bord du yacht de luxe
ferdinand-de-lesseps,
en l’absence de tout animal, du moindre arbrisseau,
se nourrissant exclusivement de pain et de riz en raison d’une
dysenterie contractée l’après-midi de son arrivée,
l’attaque, deux fois aussi forte que celle dont il a été victime au
restaurant,
lui fait soudain comprendre la nature multifactorielle de sa
réaction :
les agents sont nombreux ;
et le plus surprenant d’entre eux,
découvert de manière empirique sur le pont supérieur
à l’occasion de la soirée « valses de vienne »,
est certainement les femmes. pas un certain type de femmes,
non, les femmes en général.
il faut préciser que les hommes l’irritent presque autant
et là encore, quels qu’ils soient.
seuls les enfants, les bébés surtout, et les grands vieillards
— il y en a deux ou trois qui se réchauffent au soleil du désert
recroquevillés dans leur fauteuil roulant —
semblent dépourvus de ces éléments que rejette si violemment
son organisme.","mr. nobody’s allergies
mr. nobody, no longer young, develops an allergy to tuna;
he discovers this by accident
in an italian restaurant in the historic city center.
his face turns red, his eyes go bloodshot
his table-mates push their chairs back, terrified,
say a doctor should be called immediately
but mr. nobody categorically refuses all aid
and staggers toward the men’s room
where he plunges his head into the toilet bowl.
he has barely recovered from his first attack
when a second occurs,
even worse,
which keeps him flat on his back for several days.
despite a meticulous reconstitution of his liquid and solid intake,
he arrives at no convincing explanation,
and mr. nobody wonders if it wasn’t the environment which had provoked his illness this time.
he suspects the pigeons in the square where, when the weather permits,
he goes to sit and read the evening newspaper,
the neighbor’s cat who mysteriously prefers his terrace crowded with worm-eaten boxes and rusty metal chairs
to her mistress’s, planted with flowers
or it could be the dying cypress tree behind the augustine monastery,
last vestige of a departed park.
then, during a cruise on the nile on the luxury yacht ferdinand de lesseps
where there were no animals, and not the smallest shrub,
and he ate only bread and rice due to a case of dysentery he’d contracted the very afternoon of his arrival
an attack twice as virulent as the one he’d suffered in the restaurant
made him suddenly understand the multifaceted nature of his ailment:
the sources of his pathology were numerous;
and the most surprising among them,
discovered empirically on the upper deck
on the occasion of an evening of viennese waltzes
was women. not a certain type of woman,
no, women in general.
one must add that men irritated him almost equally,
and there, too, of whatever sort.
only children, babies especially, and the very old
– there are two or three hunched in their wheelchairs warming themselves in the desert sun –
seem to lack these elements that so violently reject

In banal photos

just like the accordion
The obsessive voice
only its lonelity

he glimpses a sheet of letterhead paper and jots a question on it:
by whom would i like to be greeted?

he slips the paper, folded in quarters, into an envelope he leaves prominently visible on the bolster

tu es belle. et je suis fou.
corps de pierre. corps solaire. corps solitaire. lactescence estivale. echancrure sauvage. tu es ma chair d’ivoire. astre noir. mon obscène territoire. tu m’emmures sous le dôme des lamentations. ma succulence permise. ma maîtresse. ma connivence sensuelle. ma lunaire tyrannique. princesse endiablée. lacis de sueur. idole enrobée de soie. et d’épines.
œuvre de feu et de sang. les aréoles de tes lèvres épousent et entaillent ma peau. assèche-moi. je suis désert. flagelle-moi. je suis esclave. inféode-moi. je suis ta propriété. ton bibelot. je plisse ta nuque. j’éploie ton ventre. dunes célestes. ta chevelure est une liasse de flammes. tes yeux un ouragan de sable. j’éventre ta langue engorgée et me désaltère. elle est hostie pour ma bouche infidèle. elle est calice pour ma bouche hérétique.
je renonce au devoir. a la raison. je suis dévot aux lieux de la débauche. je suis mendiant au seuil de ta taverne. je m’abreuve aux sources hallucinées. opium et vin. je renifle tes arômes opiacés. je mords tes ébréchures alcoolisées.
je suis celui revêtu de guenilles qui lave et baise tes pieds. je veux boire. encore boire. encore boire. et me dissoudre sous les osmoses de l’ivresse.
je suis amant de l’amour. celui revêtu de laine. celui revêtu de crasse et de boue.
celui qui se prosterne sur ton corps. lieu de vénération. lieu de prière.
celui qui à l’aurore de ton voile récite les silences de tes yeux. celui qui glane des nattes de sang sur ton mausolée.
et tu es mon livre sanctifié. mon poème.
et je suis poète fou qui quémande le sens de ton verbe. et je suis poète fou qui vole la parole.
poète fou qui dérobe ses obéissances. poète fou qui professe une parole transmuée.
parole incantatoire pour te célébrer et te créer. parole au-delà de la parole pour t’aimer.
et tu es ma féconde indélicate. celle qui me purge de mes lassitudes. celle qui reflue mes fautes et mes rancœurs. celle qui coalise extase et douleur
et ton nectar infeste mes rêves les plus nonchalants. ton nectar infeste mes repentirs nocturnes.
tu es festin que je romps et qui me corrompt.
et je déguste ta gorge blanche. je hume tes senteurs épicées. je soutire tes sèves tuméfiées.
et tu es ma vanité. ma lascive. ma vierge indécente.
tu sillonnes les mers vengeresses et les rues fétides. tu sillonnes ma carcasse avide et mes plaisirs terrifiés. tandis que ma salive adultère encore tes lèvres. tandis que les liqueurs dédiées à la jouissance suturent encore ta peau fissurée.
tu es femme et la nuit carnassière froisse les tombeaux. tu es femme et le ciel exsude des flocons de pierre.
tu es femme et l’océan se désertifie et la terre se décalcifie. tu es femme et les bêtes frémissent les signes de l’apocalypse.
et tu es belle. ma gazelle opaline. eau qui pleut entre mes cils. soupirs qui veloutent mes songes. safran qui pave mes cicatrices.
et tu es belle. ma douce. ma moelleuse. ton visage une aube lumineuse. nébuleuse bleue. collier de poussière d’étoiles. collier de promesses infinies.
et tu es belle. mon trésor caché. coulis de diamants. tresses de perles. canevas de rubis. je suis l’orfèvre de tes enchantements. de tes paresses.
et tu es belle. femme-île. ile-femme. je résilie les ailleurs et m’assermente insulaire. je suis phare dressé sur ton nombril. j’éclaire les cantiques de tes luxuriances.
et je veux encore longtemps ramper tel un animal sur ton linceul. et le rapiécer avec mon sang. et m’endormir mêlé – à mon refuge – à ton corps livide.
et je noircis mes yeux avec les cendres de ma lune noire. et je renie les théâtres convulsés et frivoles de l’éphémère. et ma chair soumise et aveuglée se livre aux obsessions et aux intolérances de ton culte.
et je suis corps-instrument. corps-tabla. corps-ravane.
et tu me cadences dans les tranchées de tes lèvres. et tu m’excises sur ton crucifix.
et tu es miroir.
et tu infléchis la migration des astres. et tu enneiges les soleils.
tu es miroir. et tu décolores les incarnats vénéneux du mal.
tu es miroir. et dans tes abîmes je déracine mon moi afin d’être toi.
tu es miroir. et je te fracasse.
et tes scissures tranchent mes veines. et mon sang longtemps après ma mort moissonnera ton souffle sur les esplanades de la folie.
et je suis poussière qui cerne niche incandescente.
coeur du monde.
et je décapite les têtes de ceux – mécréants et fidèles – qui à tes pieds se vautrent mais qui ne savent déterrer les alchimies de l’amour.
et je vagabonde dans ma barque fragile avec les âmes proscrites et maladives.
et je donne à manger à l’estropié. je chante les infamies avec le lépreux. et mon corps est abri pour le chien galeux. et mon corps est armure pour le clochard. et mon corps est puits pour les larmes de la femme déchue.
et en leur demeure qui est ma demeure je converse avec les fous.
et nos lèvres ensanglantées dansent paroles inspirées qui récitent les versets de l’amour.
et tu es belle. ma fée noire. ma blessure noire. et je veux exténuer prunelles noires qui creusent des verbes dans ma peau. et cisailler rêve d’ébène. ecorcer ce rêve d’ébène.
extraire son essence et démêler tes extravagances.
et je psalmodie ton nom quand le néant m’engloutit. et j’invoque ton nom quand la guerre vomit des cadavres d’enfants.
et j’implore ton nom quand mes larmes s’effacent et que je ne veux et ne peux plus pleurer.
et je suis en attente.

et je suis en attente.
du suc noir qui peuple ta peau. du suc noir qui enfle ta rage.
qu’il m’entaille et qu’il m’empale. qu’il m’abandonne en pâture à la foule bouffonne et cruelle.

et je veux mourir.
et je guette luminescences qui annoncent mon sacrifice.
affûtez vos sabres mes amis.
car je ne reconnais ni la mort ni la vie.
car mourir c’est renaître en toi. c’est être toi.
et tu es belle. la plus belle.
et je voyage hors des enclaves du temps.
je suis amant de tous tes lieux. là où tu as été et là ou tu seras.
je suis père et je t’ai imaginée. je suis mère et je t’ai façonnée. je suis ton premier sourire et ta première gorgée de lait.
je suis les terres que tu as foulées. et les ciels que tu as désertés. je suis tes mains dépliées à l’heure de la prière. et tes mains nouées à l’heure de la douleur.
je suis les houles que tu as caressées. et les tourmentes que tu as apaisées.
je suis les lettres qui cisèlent ton prénom. et le livre sacré qui recèle nos conjugaisons.
je suis les mains qui berceront ton dernier souffle. et les mains qui t’endormiront dans ton tombeau.
et je t’aime.
et un seul atome de ton amour me rassasie. et me resplendit.
un seul atome de ton amour ampute mes laideurs. et expurge mes pourritures.
un seul atome de ton amour suffit à ce que je m’oublie.
et je ne pense qu’à toi.
un seul atome de ton amour me béatifie. et je suis l’élu.
et je t’aime.
et tu es en toutes choses.
tu es soleil qui débride les gangues de l’obscur. soleil qui écarlate les indolences des océans.
tu es les larmes qui inaugurent les coutures de l’aube.
larmes qui fêtent la sécession des crépuscules. larmes qui fauchent les cavalcades des lunes.
et tu es en toutes choses.
tu es les âmes violentées. et les monstres qui nous assaillent.
et les haches qui embaument nos prunelles.
tu es les fugaces de l’amour au coucher de nos haines irrémédiables.
tu es reliquat de neige et rafales de feu qui tamisent mes nuits.
et je t’aime
et je suis solitaire prostré dans le désert.
et je jeûne.
et je lapide les spectres des ailleurs.
et je jeûne.
mon corps encerclé une plaie. une crevasse.
une dépouille et un habitacle pour tes éblouissements.
toi.
et tu es belle.
et je vois entrelacés dans tes yeux ambrés et dans ton corps diaphane le paradis et l’enfer.
et je ne désire ni la grâce ni les damnations mais ton amour.
ton amour seul.
et je t’aime.
je bannis mon coeur afin d’être ton coeur.
je m’arrache à moi-même afin de vivre en toi.

you are beautiful. and i am mad.
body of stone. body of sun. body alone. summer milkiness. neckline’s wild plunge. you are my ivory flesh. black star. my province of obscene desire. you seal me up in walls beneath the dome of lamentations. my permitted succulence. my mistress. my connivance of the senses. my tyrannical moon-being. my possessed princess. my filigree of sweat, my idol wrapped in silk. and thorns.
work of fire and blood. your circling lips marry and notch my skin. dry me. i am a desert. whip me. i am a slave. make me your vassal. i am your thing. your trinket. i pleat up your nape. i open out your belly’s secrets. your celestial dunes. your hair is a sheaf of flames. your eyes a hurricane of sand. i slit your swollen tongue and quench my thirst. it is a sacred wafer for that infidel, my mouth. it is a chalice for my mouth, heretical.
i renounce all duty. reason. i am a worshipper in places of excess. i am a beggar at the threshold of your tavern. i quench my thirst hallucinating at your springs. with opium and wine. i sniff your opiate fragrances. i bite your intoxicating nicks and cracks.
i am the one in rags who bathes your feet with kisses. i want to drink. and drink again. and drink. and then dissolve, sucked up by the small cells of drunkenness.
i am love’s lover. the one in wool. the one in clothes of mud and grime.
the one who prostrates himself across your body. i am the place of veneration. the place of prayer.
the one who at your veil’s first light recites your eyes’ silences. the one who gleans braids of blood on your mausoleum.
and you are my sacred book. my poem.
and i am a mad poet begging for the meaning of your verb. and i am a mad poet stealing words.
mad poet pocketing his gestures of obedience. mad poet who declares a transmuted language.
words of incantation to celebrate and create you. words beyond words to love you.
and you are my fertile one, my indecorous one. the one who purges me of all my weariness. who ebbs away my faults and my resentments. who brings together ecstasy and pain.
and your nectar permeates my most unruffled dreams. your nectar saturates my night repentances.
you are a feast i break, a celebration which corrupts.
and i savour your white throat. i breathe your spicy scents, decant your swelling beads of sap.
and you are my vanity. my lustful one. my shameless virgin.
you criss-cross the vengeful seas, the fetid streets. you criss-cross my greedy carcass and my terrified delights. while my saliva still besmears your lips. and while the liquors of enjoyment dry to threads stitching your fissured skin.
you are a woman and the hungry dark crumples the graves. you are a woman and the sky exudes flakes of stone.
you are a woman and the ocean dries to desert and the earth decalcifies. you are a woman and the animals are shivering apocalyptic signs.
and you are beautiful. my opaline gazelle. the water that rains down between my lashes. sighs which stroke my dreams to velvet. saffron to dress the surface of my scars.
and you are beautiful. my gentle one. my yielding one. your face a shining dawn. blue nebula. a necklace of the dust of stars. necklace of endless promises.
and you are beautiful. my hidden treasure. ripple of diamonds. tresses of pearls. canvas of rubies. i am the silversmith of your enchantments. of your idleness.
and you are beautiful. a woman-island. island-woman. i revoke my elsewheres, take my island-dweller’s oath. i am a lighthouse built on your belly-button. i light up the canticles of your luxuriance.
and i still want for years to come to crawl like an animal across your shroud. and patch it with my blood. and go to sleep co-mingled with my refuge – with your bloodless body.
and i black my eyes with the ashes of my black moon. and i disclaim the frivolous distorted dramas of the fleeting. and my blinded subject flesh gives itself up to the obsessions and the prejudices of your cult.
and i am a body-instrument. a body-tabla. a body-ravane.
and you give me rhythm in the furrows of your lips. and you excise me on your crucifix.
and you are a mirror.
and you inflect the migration of the stars. and wreath the suns in snow.
you are a mirror. you suck the crimson out of evil’s poisonous reds.
you are a mirror. deep in your glass i uproot myself in order to be you.
you are a mirror. and i shatter you.
your fractures slice my veins. long after i have died my blood will collect your breath on madness’s esplanades.
and i am dust circling a white-hot niche.
the world’s heart.
and i cut off the heads of those – faithful and unbelievers – who wallow at your feet but who cannot unearth the alchemies of love.
and i drift about in my fragile boat with the souls of the outlawed and the weak.
and i give the lame to eat. i sing of infamy with lepers. and my body is a shelter for the mangy dog. and my body is a suit of armour for the tramp. my body is a well for the fallen woman’s weeping.
and in their dwelling-place which is my dwelling-place i converse with madmen.
and our bloody lips are dancing inspired words reciting verses from the book of love.
and you are beautiful. my black fairy. my black wound. and i want to exhaust black pupils excavating verbs inside my skin. and chisel an ebony dream. to strip the bark from this ebony dream.
extract its essence and unravel all your strange excesses.
and i chant your name as nothingness engulfs me i invoke your name when war throws up the bodies of dead children.
and i implore your name when my tears are wiped away and i no longer want to, can no longer cry.
and i am in waiting.
for the black sap that runs like nerves within your rounded flesh. for the black sap which inks in your hair.
and i am in waiting.
for the black sap which populates your skin. for the black sap which swells your rage.
let it cut into me, impale me. let it abandon me as fodder for the spiteful crowd of clowns.
for i am nothing.
and i want to die.
and i watch for glimmers which foretell my sacrifice.
my friends, sharpen your sabres.
for i do not recognise either death or life.
for to die is to be reborn in you. it is to be you.
and you are beautiful. you are the most beautiful.
and i am travelling beyond the bounds of time.
i am the lover of all your places. where you have been and where you will be.
i am a father and i have conjured you in my imagination. i am a mother and i have fashioned you. i am your first smile and your first gulp of milk.
i am the tracts of land which you have trampled. and the skies you have deserted. i am your hands unfolded at the hour of prayer. and your hands knotted at the hour of pain.
i am the swelling seas you have caressed. and the raging tumults you have calmed.
i am the letters that chisel your first name. and the sacred book which holds the secret of our conjugations.
i am the hands that will rock your final breath. and the hands that will stroke you to sleep inside your tomb.
and i love you.
and a single atom of your love can satisfy my hunger. and makes me shine.
a single atom of your love amputates all my unsightliness. and purges me of my rottenness.
a single atom of your love and i forget myself.
and i think of you alone.
a single atom of your love and i am beatified. i am the chosen one.

Work of fire and blood. The treoles of your lips marry and carry my skin. Dry me. I'm desert. flagelle me. I'm a slave. Infeude me. I'm your property. your bird. I plize your nack.

I am the one dressed with guilds which waves and kisses your feet. I want to drink again. drink again. and dissolve me under the osmoses of intoxication.
I'm a lover of love. The one white woman. The one woman woman. The one woman woman. The one woman woman. The one woman woman woman. The one woman woman. The one woman woman.
The one who prostrates on your body. place of veneration. place of prayer.
The one who, in the dawn of your veil, recitals the silences of your eyes. The one who grows bloods on your mausoleum.
And you're my sanctified book. My poem.
And I'm a crazy poet who watches the sense of your verb. And I'm a crazy poet who flys the word.
A crazy poet who his obeyances. A crazy poet who propheses a transmuted word.
Incantatory word to say you and to create you. Word beyond the word to love you.
And you are my indelicate feducity, the one who purges me from my tires, the one who refuses my mistakes and my rancors, the one who coalizes ecstasy and pain
And your nectar incests my most nonchant dreams. Your nectar incests my nocting regrets.
You're a festiny that I burn and that purposes me.
And I taste your white throat. I hume your spiced scents. I support your tumefied saps.
And you're my vanity. My leasive. My indecent wife.
You roam the vengeful seas and the fetid streets. You roam my avid carcass and my terrified pleasures. Which my salive still adults your lips. Which the liqueurs dedicated to the pleasure still suture your broken skin.
you're a woman and the night carnassière flows the graves. you're a woman and the sky exudes rock flowers.
you're a woman and the ocean is deserted and the earth is decalcied. you're a woman and the birds shut the signs of the apocalypse.
And you're beautiful. My opaline gail. water that rains between my eyes. Sweepers that velve my dreams. saffron that paves my scars.
And you're beautiful. my sweet. my meelleuse. your face a light dawn. blue nebulous. collier of star dust. collier of infinite promises.
And you're beautiful. My secret treasure. Slowed with diamonds. Bead braids. Ruby sleepers. I'm the gold of your enchantments. of your parsesses.
And you're beautiful. Island-Woman. Ile-Woman. I resil the elsewhere and surely insular. I'm a star on your navel. I light the cantices of your luxuriances.
And I still want for a long time to return like an animal on your line. And to raptie it with my blood. And to sleep in mix – in my refuge – with your lived body.
And I blacked my eyes with the ashes of my black moon. And I rened the convulsed and frivolent theathers of the ephemer. And my subdued and blinded flesh is able to obsessions and tolerations of your cult.
And I'm body-instrument. body-tabla. body-ravan.
And you cad me in the slices of your lips. And you excision me on your crucifix.
And you're a mirrous.
And you inflect the migration of the stars. And you snow the suns.
you're a mirror, and you're blooting the vengeful incarnates of evil.
You're a mirror. And in your mirrors, I'm deraking my me so I can be you.
You're a mirror, and I'm bringing you.
And your slices slice my veins. And my blood long after my death will move your breath on the splades of crazy.
And I'm the dust that ends incandescent night.
heart of the world.
And I decapitate the heads of those – unbelieving and believing – who at your feet were worthing but who do not know to deterre the alchimies of love.
And I roam in my fragile boat with the proscribed and crazy souls.
And I give eat to the stropy. I sing the infamies with the leper. And my body is hold for the gale dog. And my body is armurous for the bellet. And my body is hold for the tears of the deaded woman.
And in their home, that is my home, I converse with the crazy.
And our blood lips dance, inspired words that cry the verses of love.
And you're beautiful. My black fee. My black wound. And I want to extenuate black prunes that burn verbs in my skin. And chisall ebony dream. To burn this ebony dream.
take it's gas and untire your extravagants.
And I psalmody your name when nothing enjoys me. And I call your name when warms put of children's bodies.
And I beg your name when my tears fade and I don't want and can't cry anymore.
And I'm waiting.
Black suc that ennerces your curves. Black suc that ink your hair.
And I'm waiting.
Black suck that pops your skin. Black suck that inflames your rabies.
May he small me and embalm me. May he abandon me in the pasture to the clumsy and cruel crowd.
'Cause I'm nothing.
And I want to die.
And I watch for lights that tell my sacrifice.
Look your sabers, my friends.
'Cause I don't know death or life.
For to die is to be regained in you. is to be you.
And you're beautiful. The most beautiful.
And I'm waiting out the enclaves of time.
I'm a lover of all your place, where you've been and where you'll be.
I'm a father and I imagined you. I'm a mother and I made you. I'm your first smile and your first smoke of milk.
I am the lands that you have followed. And the skys that you have deserted. I am your hands wronged at the time of prayer. And your hands wronged at the time of pain.
I am the houles that you caresed. And the torments that you soothed.
I am the letters that chisele your name And the holdbook that remains our conjugations
I am the hands that will bring your last blow. And the hands that will sleep you in your grave.
And I love you.
And the one atom of your love smalls me, and smalls me.
Only one atom of your love amputes my wonders and extrudes my filths.
Alone atome of your love is enough for me to forget.
And I only think of you.
Only one atom of your love beats me. And I am the one.
And I love you.
And you're in all things.
You are the sun that debrides the gangs of the dark. sun that scars the indolences of the oceans.
you are the tears that inaugurate the sutures of dawn.
tears that say the sesection of twilight. tears that smoke the moon's cavalcades.
And you're in all things.
you're the violent souls and the monsters who rake us.
And the axes that embalm our prunes.
you are the fleaks of love in the beding of our irremediable haves.
You're relided with snow and smalls of fire that small my nights.
And I love you
And I'm lonely prostrated in the desert.
And I'm waiting.
And I burn the spectra of the other place.
And I'm waiting.
my body enclosed a worl. A crevass.
A depth and a bedroom for your dazzlings.
You.
And you're pretty.
And I see intertwined in your amber eyes and in your body diaphanes the paradise and the hell.
And I don't desire for grace or for damning, but for your love.
your love alone.
And I love you.
I banished my heart to be your heart.
I get up to myself so I can live in you.
Give me the extinction."

"je ne me souviens pas
il n’y a pas grand-chose dont je me souvienne
j’ai dû vivre à côté tout le long
sans être ailleurs non plus
je m’en souviendrais
je ne me souviens pas qu’un jour tout ou quelque chose ait basculé.
– souviens-toi de rester vivante.
je mélange les lieux où tombent les hommes qui tombent.
je ne me souviens pas où sont les lignes de front
si nous pouvons mettre autour
et les enfouir
appuyer ses doigts le long
les masser puis les marcher avec les pieds
dessus courir sans se prendre les pieds dedans.
je ne me souviens pas de l’histoire ni de la géographie de ce qui
s’accomplit je ne me souviens pas de la situation des pays les uns
par rapport aux autres sauf alphabétiquement
l’iran touche l’irak touche le koweït
le k de kurdistan dans turquie dans irak
les k de congo
dans kasaï kiwu katanga
les voyelles entremêlées de rwanda burundi ouganda
je me rappelle les proximités sonnantes
daghestan kazakhstan kirghizistan près d’afghanistan
les voies ghijk de l’acheminement du pétrole
les s de squelettes dans somalie soudan
et les os du e de erythrée ethiopie.
je ne me souviens pas de ce dont les journaux que je lis ne
parlent pas ni de ce qu’ils citent comme événements de
référence je ne me souviens même pas en avoir un jour entendu
parler ni qu’on m’ait raconté ce dont je ne me souviens pas.
suis-je le souvenir indifférent de ce dont je ne me souviens pas ?
etait-ce avant que je puisse me souvenir qu’on avait déjà résolument
voulu perdre la mémoire envers ceux qui ne se souviendraient pas ?
pourtant il y a des choses je le sais dont je n’ai pas le droit de dire
que je ne m’en souviens pas
des choses prodigieuses ou terribles délibérément brouillées dans un
passé dont je ne ferais plus partie comme si cela était possible.
les lettres de ce dont je ne me souviens pas
sautent sans que je puisse déchiffrer
ce qu’elles bruissent
insinuant juste que
reléguées hors
je ne dois plus respirer
pas bouger.
je dois retrouver les mots de ce dont sinon
je vais perdre tout à fait la trace
la trace que laissent les corps
au lieu des mondes inventés
possibles disparus on ne sait pas où.
on me dit que ces mots exagèrent
c’est plus compliqué tu ne peux pas
dire les choses si
simplement d’un côté
les tueurs et de l’autre
les morts.
ce ne serait donc pas brutalement simple
et seuls les mots seraient inhumains.
je récite ce dont je ne me souviens pas me souviens
à la recherche d’une place dans le récit
qui n’est pas dans ta langue indifférente
mais dans les bribes qui viennent d’ailleurs
ailleurs auquel nous devrions appartenir
au lieu de nous dissiper avec ce que nous faisons disparaître.
il faudrait souffler beaucoup plus d’air autour des nouvelles qu’elles
volent en cercle autour de nous le soir
avec les hirondelles qui crient
je ne me souviens pas où s’enfoncent
les affamés auxquels je vole
puis largue la nourriture émiettée
chutent les lettres minuscules des nouvelles
effacées les unes dans les autres
sur les squelettes dans toutes les positions
de très jolies photographies avec de grands yeux
il faudrait souffler beaucoup plus d’air
autour des hommes qui tombent
pour qu’ils remontent en cercle
le soir autour de nous
avec les hirondelles
qui crient
ellipses
mais rapportent leurs visages.

cerait dans l’ac
tion jour
seoir

privées traversantes de dans hors.

des mots moqués se relever sans disparaître.

on a lively, noisy avenue
nothing around you will have really changed
you will still be father, son and lover

asking yourself what love is
if you found it, lost it, or if it always escaped you
examining memories attentively

now sees only reticular surfaces
forgetting the creature caught in a fog-drowned park

"les yeux des autres
c’est une jeune femme qui vit dans un village dans un pays lointain,
elle vient de se marier et elle est enceinte, elle aime bien son mari
car il travaille dur, il est plutôt gentil et il ne la bat pas et elle
attend avec impatience la naissance de son enfant, elle le sent, dans
son ventre, grandir tous les jours un peu, comme une graine qui pousse
et pousse, ce sera une fille, elle le sait et elle l’aime déjà, très
fort, tout comme elle aime sa petite vie, parfois, il est vrai, elle a
des rêves fous, surtout quand elle regarde la télé, elle aimerait,
elle aussi, faire le tour du monde, visiter de grandes villes,
rencontrer un beau prince et chanter sous la neige une belle chanson
romantique et elle se dit qu’elle est folle de penser à tout ça, t’es
folle toi, t’es folle toi, mais elle aime bien sa petite vie, il y a
bien sûr sa belle-mère qui est une peste mais il y a, comme le dit si
bien sa sœur, en pouffant de rire, pire peste ailleurs et elle aime
bien sa petite vie et ce qu’elle aime peut-être le plus c’est de se
rendre à la mer le matin, elle y va seule, très tôt et alors elle se
met à courir vite, très vite, tellement vite qu’elle a l’impression de
perdre la tête, elle se met à hurler, c’est un bonheur tellement fort
qu’il déboussole ses sens et elle aime aussi les arbres, ils sont si
forts, si puissants, ainsi enracinés dans la terre depuis toujours et
elle aime aussi les étoiles, elles sont si belles et elle se demande
ce qu’elles sont vraiment, ceux qui sont allés à l’école disent que ce
sont des boules de feu, elle n’arrive pas tellement à comprendre mais
elle sait qu’elles sont très belles et elle aimerait les toucher,
aller sur une étoile, y vivre mais t’es folle toi, t’es folle toi,
c’est ce qu’elle se dit, t’es folle de penser à tout ça, elle sait, au
fond, beaucoup de choses mais elle n’aime pas en parler, elle se méfie
des hommes car ils ont peur des femmes, elle se méfie des commères du
village qui ne comprennent jamais rien à rien, elle sait, mais c’est
difficile à expliquer, dénouer le sens des yeux et elle y voit
tellement de choses, de l’amour, souvent, beaucoup et l’amour c’est
comme quand les enfants se mettent à danser, ça va un peu dans toutes
les directions, c’est gai et ça donne le tournis mais il y aussi la
haine et la haine fait peur et lui donne envie de fuir car c’est comme
un feu de brousse qui consume tout et elle se dit qu’elle est
décidément folle, t’es folle toi, t’es folle toi, c’est pas très
normal d’être comme ça, de rire à tout bout de champ et depuis qu’elle
est enceinte il y a en elle comme une musique, quelque chose de
mélodieux, de magique, qui inonde son corps, c’est beau et c’est fort
et elle sait que ce sera une fille, qu’elle lui ressemblera et qu’elle
sera, mais ça c’est son mari qui l’affirme, qu’il est bête parfois,
aussi belle qu’elle et elle se dit qu’un jour elles s’en iront admirer
les arbres et les étoiles, qu’elles s’en iront courir dans les champs,
courir vite, très vite, de plus en plus vite et elles se mettront à
crier tellement c’est bon, elle sera coquette et elle lui fera de
beaux vêtements et elle l’enlacera très fort pour s’imprégner de son
innocence, elle aime bien sa petite vie et puis un jour il se passe
quelque chose au village, on a peine d’abord à mettre le doigt dessus,
il parait que ce sont les gens de la ville qui inventent des choses,
qui disent qu’elle et sa famille sont différents, qu’ils sont des
cancrelats ou des microbes, elle a envie de rire quand elle entend ça
car tout le monde au village est pareil, ils disent aussi que leurs
ancêtres ont tout pillé mais qu’est-ce qu’elle sait de ses ancêtres,
qu’il faut se méfier d’eux car ils ont un double visage, qu’ils
veulent voler nos femmes, qu’ils font beaucoup d’enfants délibérément,
qu’ils sentent mauvais et elle entend sourdre une parole sournoise,
des mots qui éclatent, qui giclent, comme le ‘nous’, ainsi sa meilleure
amie lui dit que ‘nous’ sommes différents de vous, elle se demande qui
est ce nous, ce fameux nous, elle n’arrive pas à comprendre et puis un
jour alors qu’elle est sur le point de s’endormir elle entend un cri,
cri d’un être qu’on égorge, cri qui fend le ciel et alors quelque
chose se casse en elle, cette peur trop longtemps contenue, ce savoir
trop longtemps retenu et alors elle se met à courir, à s’enfuir, pour
aller où, elle ne le sait trop mais c’est trop tard et elle les voit
arriver mais ce ne sont plus des hommes mais des bêtes et ils ont à la
main des haches, des serpes, tout l’attirail de la cruauté, le regard
creux, deux trous à la place des yeux, ils s’approchent d’elle,
l’insultent mais elle n’entend plus, ne veut plus entendre et elle ne
veut pas mourir, pas maintenant, pas comme ça et elle murmure le nom
de dieu, protège mon enfant, protège mon enfant et l’un d’eux, c’est
un jeune, elle le reconnaît, c’est son voisin, s’approche d’elle, lui
crache dessus, lui dit de se mettre à genoux, à genoux salope, tu vas
payer maintenant, regardez là, cette chienne, elle a envie qu’on
l’encule, elle a envie de nos grosses bittes, à genoux je te dis, on
va t’apprendre à nous respecter, à respecter tes maîtres, à genoux,
sale pute et tandis qu’il l’éventre et dépèce son fœtus, qu’il déverse
sur elle de l’essence et l’incendie, flânent et ne cesseront de flâner
dans les yeux de cette jeune femme, – d’un pays lointain mais qui
ressemble au nôtre –, la féerie lumineuse de la mer, des arbres et des
étoiles.","the eyes of others
she’s a young woman living in a village in a distant country,
she’s just got married and she’s pregnant, and she likes her husband
he works hard, he’s pretty nice to her and doesn’t beat her and she
waits impatiently for her baby to be born, she feels it, in her
belly, growing a bit each day, it’s like a seed that’s growing,
growing, it’ll be a girl, she knows it will, and she already loves her
very fiercely, as she loves her little life, sometimes, it’s true, she has
mad dreams, especially when she watches the tv, she too
would like to travel round the world, to visit cities,
meet a handsome prince and stand there in the snow and sing
a sweet romantic song and she tells herself she’s mad to think
of all that stuff, you’re crazy, you are, but she likes her little life, of course
there is her husband’s mother who’s a pain but there are, as her sister
neatly puts it, giggling, worse pains somewhere else and she quite likes
her little life and maybe what she loves the most is going down
to the sea each morning, she goes very early on her own and then
she starts to run, run fast, run very fast, so fast she feels as if she’s
lost her head, she starts to yell, her happiness so strong
it muddles all her senses and she also loves the trees, they are so
strong, so powerful, deep-rooted in the earth like that since the
beginning and she loves the stars as well, they are so lovely and she wonders
what they really are, the ones who’ve been to school they say they’re
balls of fire, she doesn’t really grasp it all that well but knows
they’re very beautiful and that she’d like to touch,
to travel to a star and live there but you’re crazy, you are, crazy,
that’s what she tells herself, you’re mad to think of all that stuff, she knows
deep down, a lot of things she doesn’t like to talk about, she doesn’t trust
the men because they’re scared of women, doesn’t trust the gossips
in the village, they haven’t got a clue about it all, she knows, but it is
hard to work it out, untangle all the meanings in their eyes and she can see
so many things in them, like love, quite often, lots, and love is
like children when they start to dance, it goes a bit in all
directions and it’s full of laughter makes you giddy but there’s also
hate and hate is scary, makes her want to run away, it’s like
a bushfire eating things all up and she tells herself she’s
mad, no question, you are crazy, you are, crazy, it’s not really
normal to be like this, to laugh at every little thing and ever since
she’s been expecting there’s a sort of music in her, something
tuneful, magical, that floods her body, something beautiful and strong
and she knows it’s going to be a girl, she’ll be like her and be –
but it’s her husband who maintains, how silly he is sometimes –
just as beautiful as she is and she tells herself one day they’ll go
and marvel at the trees, the stars, they’ll run out in the fields,
run fast, run very fast, and faster, faster and they’ll start
to shout it feels so good, she’ll delight in pretty things, she’ll make her
lovely clothes and she will hug her hard so she’ll absorb
her innocence, she likes her little life, then one day in the village
something happens, difficult at first to put your finger on,
it seems that people from the town are making something up,
saying that she and hers are different, that they’re
like cockroaches or microbes, when she hears it she wants to laugh
because here in the village everyone’s the same, they also say
their ancestors were looters but what does she know of her ancestors,
that they can’t be trusted, that they’re all two-faced, they want
to steal our women, that they have a lot of children out of stubbornness
and that they smell, she hears a sneaky sort of word well up,
those burst-and-splatter words, like ‘we’, the way her closest
friend will tell her ‘we’ are different from you, she wonders who
they are this we, this famous we, she doesn’t get it, then one day
when she is on the point of dozing off she hears a scream,
the scream of someone having his throat cut, a scream which splits the sky
and something in her breaks, this fear too long held in, this knowledge
stifled for too long and then she starts to run, to run away, to
go – where can she go, she’s no idea but it’s too late and she can see
them coming but they’ve changed from men to animals and in their
hands they carry hatchets, hooks, a torture toolkit, and their eyes
are hollow, holes where eyes should be, they’re coming closer,
they insult her but she can no longer hear them, she won’t hear them, she
won’t die, not now, and not like this, she’s murmuring the name
of god, protect my child, protect my child and one of them
is young, she recognises him, he is her neighbour, he comes up
and spits on her, he tells her to kneel down, down on your knees, you slut,
you’ve got it coming now, just look at her, the bitch, she’d like us all
to fuck her, fancies our big cocks, down on your knees i said, we’ll
teach you to respect us, to respect your masters, on your knees
you filthy whore and while he slits her belly cuts her foetus up and empties
petrol over her and lights it, in the eyes of this young woman – from a country
distant yet not different from ours – still lingers, and will always linger

its bird, grow every day a little, like a grain that grows

crazy dreams, especially when she looks on TV, she would like,

hard to explain, unknow the sense of the eyes and she sees it
So many things, of love, often, much and love is
like when children start to dance, it goes a little in everything

mais surtout sur le banc à greenwich,
le ciel immense, le soir qui tombait
sur la ligne des peupliers bordant la pelouse
où des enfants jouaient au foot, des gens promenaient
leur chien,

pitoyable,

je viens de lire ta première lettre (elle date du 23 novembre 1960). tu m’as donc écrit, en moyenne, depuis cette date, une lettre toutes les six semaines deux tiers (il n’y a jamais eu d’intervalle de moins de six semaines et de plus de sept entre deux de tes lettres) et quelque chose m’a frappé. tu m’écrivais (je te le rappelle, au cas où tu l’aurais oublié): « as-tu reçu ma dernière lettre? si oui (et je serais fort étonné que tu ne l’aie pas reçue encore (si c’était le cas, fais-le moi savoir)), as-tu l’intention d’y répondre? ». or, je n’ai aucune trace, dans mes archives, où je conserve de manière systématique et absolue, toutes les lettres que je reçois, et des doubles de toutes celles que j’envoie, je n’ai aucune trace, dis-je, d’une lettre de toi antérieure à celle du 23 novembre 1960, dont je viens de te rappeler la première phrase. ni, d’ailleurs, ce qui est au moins aussi troublant, de cette lettre de moi à laquelle tu fais allusion au milieu de ta lettre du 23 novembre 1960 qui, dans mes archives, porte, de ma main, inscrit en haut à gauche du quart de feuille 21x27, format dont tu ne t’es jamais départi pendant toutes ces années, au crayon, le n°1. pourtant, je me souviens on ne peut plus clairement de l’arrivée de ta lettre du 23 novembre 1960 (je venais de rentrer chez moi après une réunion de travail avec des amis). l’écriture m’était inconnue, ainsi que la signature, q.b., (je ne connais toujours pas, après quarante ans, autre chose de ton nom que tes initiales). je t’ai répondu immédiatement, et notre correspondance, quarante ans plus tard, dure encore. comme tu me dis, dans cette même lettre, celle du 23 novembre 1960, que tu conserves dans tes archives des doubles de toutes les lettres que tu envoies comme de toutes celles que tu reçois (information que tu ne manques pas de répéter (je le remarque en relisant notre correspondance) dans toutes, je dis bien toutes tes lettres) tu as certainement conservé le double de celle dont tu parles au commencement de la lettre du 23 novembre 1960. tu pourras donc éclaircir aisément ce petit mystère.
lettre 4
je n’ai rien reçu de toi depuis sept semaines. que se passe-t-il?
lettre 5 (fragments)
je viens de recevoir (enfin!) ta dernière lettre et j’y réponds immédiatement. tu me demandes si j’ai bien reçu ta dernière lettre et si j’ai l’intention d’y répondre.

fin","correspondence
letter 1
i’ve just received your last letter and am immediately replying. you’ve asked if i’ve received your last letter and if i intend to reply. if i may, please let me point out that your having sent your last letter makes the letter you previously sent no longer the most recent, and if i reply, as i am now doing, it is not in response to your second-to-last letter. i cannot, therefore, satisfy the requests you’ve made in your last letter. i would also observe, by the way, that your last letter does not respond, despite what you affirm (and i quote: “i’ve just received your last letter and am immediately replying”), to the letter in which i queried, lest i am mistaken (but i am not mistaken, i’ve got copies), if you had received my last letter and if you intended to reply. failing any clarification and response from you on these two points, to which i attach (for good reason, i think) particular importance, i shall, much to my regret, be obliged to interrupt our correspondence.
letter 2
i have yet to receive your next letter but shall immediately reply. you ask if i’ve received your last letter and if i intend to reply. you might well wonder how, not yet having received your next letter, i can know that you’ve asked me if i’ve received your last letter and if i intend to reply. the answer is simple: all of your letters, and this one will be your three hundred and seventeenth (i have them all, as well as copies of all of mine) begin thus: “have you received my last letter? if so (and i would be quite surprised if you had not yet (though, should that be the case, do let me know)), do you intend to reply?” that’s how you began your very first letter to me. that’s how you began your second letter, your third letter, and so on, until your last letter, the three hundred and sixteenth. reasoning by induction, i’ve deduced that your next letter will begin like the preceding ones. consequently, i consider myself authorized to reply to it as if i had already received it. and i reply with the following: i’ve just received your last letter and am immediately replying. you’ve asked if i’ve received your last letter and if i intend to reply. if i may, please let me point out that your having sent your last letter makes the letter you previously sent no longer the most recent and if i reply, as i am now doing, it is not in response to your second to last letter. i cannot, therefore, satisfy the requests you’ve made in your last letter. i would also observe, by the way, that your last letter does not respond, despite what you affirm (and i quote: “i’ve just received your last letter and am immediately replying”), to the letter in which i queried, lest i am mistaken (but i am not mistaken, i’ve got copies), if you had received my last letter and if you intended to reply. failing any clarification and response from you on these two points, to which i attach (for good reason, i think) particular importance, i shall, much to my regret, be obliged to interrupt our correspondence.
letter 3
i’ve just read your first letter (dated 23 november, 1960. you have therefore written, on average, since that date, one letter every six and two thirds weeks (there never was an interval shorter than six weeks or longer than seven weeks between two of your letters)) and something has struck me. you had written (i remind you, in case you have forgotten): “have you received my last letter? if so (and i would be quite surprised if you had not yet (though, should that be the case, do let me know)), do you intend to reply?” besides, i have no trace, in my archives, where i conserve, in a systematic and absolute fashion, all the letters i receive, and the doubles of those i send—i have no trace, i was saying, of any letter from you prior to the one dated 23 november, 1960, the one whose first sentence i’ve just called to your attention. nor, for that matter, which is at least as troubling, of that letter from me to you to which you allude in the middle of your letter to me of 23 november, 1960, which bears, in the upper left quarter of the 21x27cm sheet, the format from which you have not deviated in all of these years, in your handwriting, scrawled in pencil, the number 1. nonetheless, i remember—as one could not more clearly remember—the arrival of your letter of 23 november, 1960. (i had just come home from a working meeting with friends.) the handwriting was strange to me, as was the signature: q. b. (after forty years, i still know nothing more of your name but its initials.) i immediately replied and our correspondence carries on, forty years later. since you inform me in that very same letter, the one dated 23 november, 1960, that you conserve in your archives the doubles of all the letters you send and the ones you receive (information you don’t neglect to repeat (i realize now as i look over our correspondence) in all, i did say all of your letters) you have certainly kept a double of the one you mention at the beginning of the letter dated 23 november, 1960. you could therefore easily clarify this little mystery.
letter 4
i haven’t received a thing from you in weeks. what is happening?
letter 5 (fragments)
i have just received your last letter (finally) and am immediately
replying. you ask if i’ve received your last letter and if i intend to reply.

I just received your last letter and I respond to it immediately. you ask me if I really received your last letter and if I plan to respond to it. I left you to note that your last letter makes that the letter you have been each other no longer your last letter and if I respond as I am doing to your last letter, I don't respond to the letter who is now your last letter. I can't, so I can't respond to the request you make me in your last letter. I will observe elsether that your last letter doesn't respond, as you say (I quote: ""I really respond to your last letter and I respond to it immediately"") to the letter where I asked to you, if I'm abusing (but I'm not abusing, I have the doubles) if you really received my last letter and if you wanted to respond to it. in the absence of clearings and reswers on these two points that I think (to the right) I think a certain importance, I will see my regret, I need to interpe.
word 2
I didn't received your next letter anymore, but I'll respond to it anymore. You ask myself if I really received your last letter anymore, and if I plan to respond to it. You may ask yourself how, if I didn't received your next letter anymore, I can know that you ask myself if I really received your last letter anymore, and if I plan to respond to it. The responding is simple: all your letters, and this will be the three-thirty-stee (I have all them, as do doubles of all my letters) begin with: ""Have you received my last letter anymore? if yes (and I'd be very surprised that you didn't received it anymore (if it was the case, tell me know)), do you plan to respond to it?"" It's like the first letter I've received from you. It's like the second, the three-th, and so on to your last letter, the three-stee-stee-stee. So right, I deducated your next letter anymore, as doesn't received your next letter anymore, and if I've received your letter anymore, and if I received your last letter anymore, and if I next respond to it anymore, if I received your last letter anymore, if I received your last letter anymore, and if I've responded your last letter anymore, if I responded your last letter anymore, and if I

I just read your first letter (it was from 23 November 1960). So you write me, on average, from that date, a letter every six weeks two-thirds (we never had an intermission of less six weeks and more than seven from two of your letters) and something knocked me. You writed me (I remember it, in case you forgottend it): ""Had you received my last letter? if yes (and I would be very surprised that you hadn't received it again (if it was the case, make it to me)), do you plan to respond to it?"" Or, I have no trace, in my archives, where I keep in a systemaly and above, all the letters I receive, and doubles of all the letters I ensign, I have no trace, I say, from a letter from you before to that of 23 Nove 1960, of where I just remember the first phrase to you. Now, what is almost as much as much as much of me, from this letter that you alluded to the middle of your archives, in your letter of 23 Nove, in my hand, in my hand, in my hand, in my high, in my high, in my high, in my high, in my high, in my high, in my high, in my high, in my high, in my high, in my high, in my high, in my high, in my high, in my high, in my high, in my high, in my high, in my high, in my high, in my high, in my high, in my high, in my high, in my high, in my high, in my high, in my high, in my high, in my high, in

"le sommeil du père
mon père se plaignait souvent de courbatures
il poussait des jurons en se frottant le dos
ou soudain écrasé par excès de fatigue
il tombait en sommeil comme un sac n’importe où
les jambes écartées menton sur la poitrine
il dormait effondré sous le poids du travail
et parfois même à table poussant son assiette
et le front sur ses mains il tombait endormi
alors très doucement nous ôtions sa serviette
sous son front et ses mains nous ôtions le couvert
nous débarrassions la table furtivement
sur la pointe des pieds nous désertions la salle
afin qu’il prenne comme il faut tout son repos
nous le laissions le front appuyé sur la table
où il dormait vaincu comme une bête morte
mais plus tard nous entendions crier dans la salle
il hurlait parce que le sommeil le quittait
son corps courbaturé partout lui faisait mal
ses doigts restaient en marques rouges sur sa peau
il sortait fâché du sommeil: c’était si bon
d’être parti ainsi loin de tous ses soucis!

my father often complained of aches and pains
he rubbed his back and yelled and swore
or suddenly crushed by an overwhelming fatigue
he fell asleep like a sack of potatoes anywhere
his legs apart chin on his chest
he slept flattened under the weight of work
and sometimes even at table pushing his plate
with his forehead on his hands he fell asleep
then very gently we removed his napkin
under his forehead and his hands we removed the cutlery
we stealthily cleared the table
on tip-toe we abandoned the room
to let him take all his rest as he should
we left him with his forehead resting on the table
where he slept defeated like a dead animal
but later we heard him shout in the room
he yelled because sleep had deserted him
his body hurt and ached all over
his fingers had left red marks on his skin
he woke up angry: it had been so good
to be so far away from all his cares!
and swearing and grumbling he went to marie
to the kitchen to drink a cup of black coffee
then he went out he started the car we heard

we resumed our games our fratricidal wars",fr_XX,en_XX,"The father's sleep

And sometimes even at the table through its plate

We were leaving the table furtively
on the tip of the toes we deserted the hall

forment des bandes étonnantes

et leur donne du voûtement
les femmes n’ont que deux mamelles
qu’elles font sucer aux enfants
pour les nourrir et qu’elles belles
aiment montrer sur leur devant

il pourrait les faire tarir

vêtu d’un simple cache-sexe
en train de descendre la gomme
de sa peau brune dans la peste
d’une eau trouble à bhubaneswar
ville de l’inde orientale
où la vue de cet avatar
humain me fut à grand scandale
cet animal qui descend là
tristement dans cette eau me trouble
parce qu’il montre qu’il est las
de ce qui rend sa tête lourde
et qu’il voudrait comme alléger
en la plongeant dans cette eau où
on voit les temples refléter
leurs rainures noires et rouges
alors j’ai rêvé sur nous-mêmes
et l’étrangeté que nous sommes
tant que j’ai dû faire un poème
avec tous ces mots qui résonnent
de leurs syllabes en nommant
la chose ainsi qui me tracasse
puisque moi-même en ce moment
je fais partie de cette race
dont la tête développée
est lourde à porter certains jours
et qu’il nous faut toujours bomber
malgré toujours les durs retours
de notre pensée en nous-mêmes
nous devons apprendre à bénir

vers les désirs de l’avenir","the human species
human beings are mammals (for that’s the way
they style themselves among the taxonomic classes)
who on the surface of the earth today
form astonishing masses
with their hind paws at one end
they look bizarre when they stand erect
and that makes their backbones bend
and gives their posture a stooped effect
the women have only two breasts side by side
that they give their young to feed from
to nourish them and that they don’t hide
but like to display on their chest prom-
inently and as for the male he is very proud
of his virile member and his testicles
with which he is endowed
and wants admiration for his genitals
the body of man is without a covering of fur
and that causes him to get dressed
to avoid the cold weather
making him sorry he’s not as hairy as the rest
and even in hot regions
man covers his private parts
because if he showed them to others
it might make them dry up.
if i began to write
this poem in stanzas with a classic look
it’s because of a photograph
that i saw once in a reference book
in which you see a man
wearing a simple loin-cloth
lowering the inflammation and ulceration
of his brown skin into the filthy froth
of murky water at bhubaneswar
a city of the asian east
where the sight of that human avatar
was for me shocking to say the least
this animal that goes down sadly
into this water troubles me
because it shows that it is weary
of what makes its head so heavy
and that he hoped to alleviate the effect
by plunging it in that water where
the nearby temples all reflect
their black and red grooves
then i had a dream about our kind
and the strangeness that we encapsulate
so that i had to write some lines
with all these words that resonate
with their syllables in thus putting a name
to the thing that hits me in the face
considering that i myself am in this frame
i am a member of this race
that has a highly developed head
that’s heavy to carry on certain days
and that we always have to swell
in spite of the fact that it never pays
in our thinking about our kind

'Cause it shows it's the
of what makes his head heavy
And he would like to relieve
By diving it in this water where
we see the temples resonate
their dark and red rinds
So I dreamed about us
And the strangety that we are
As long as I had to make a poem
with all the words that resonate
of their syllabes by nameing
the thing that troubles me
because I'm in this moment
I'm part of this race
which head is develoued

one day it graced gran’s shoulder when she was young
the next it’s part of the time before the dreadful time

and further on i see the horse’s ears sticking up

and where have i left my head
not in the kitchen with the scratchy very green-backed sponge

rags and napkins slipping like a knot

the ducks were true or false
and never an unwanted head

hardly ever a severed head

this drying-up nappy-it’s-not

and let them roll away the oranges and let the heavy ducks
rise up for ever to a paradise that’s lost

and everything mislaid with my loose screws
we are the skyless we soak up
let them rise to their oranges ducks the thing that counts

both of her husbands in the selfsame vault the same infinity

"identité
quelle identité serait tienne, de ta mort ?
tu es, diraient certains, la tombe et son dedans,
et la pierre tombale avec ton nom
mais cela n’est pas autre chose que dire :
vivante, tu étais ce corps vêtu et non vêtu,
ce corps qui contenait ta pensée (ou ton âme)
et ce corps aussi portait ce nom, le tien
l’identité ne persiste dans le monde que de cette analogie
tu es, diraient d’autres, telle que te restituent
dans leur souvenir, s’ils se souviennent, ceux
qui t’ont, ne serait-ce qu’un instant, connue
ainsi tu serais, mais divisée, changeante, contradictoire,
dépendante, par éclipses,
et quand chacun de ceux-là sera mort, tu ne serais plus.
et sans doute, ici encore, l’idée de survivance emprunte aux
caractéristiques mêmes du monde de ta vie
mais, pour moi, il en va tout différemment :
chaque fois que je te pense, tu cesses.","identity
what identity could be yours, that of your death?
you are, some would say, your grave and its inside,
the gravestone with your name
but that only means saying:
alive, you were this body dressed and undressed,
this body that contained your thought (or soul)
this body that also bore this, your name
identity does not last in the world except by this analogy
you are, others would say, as you are in the memory,
if they remember, of those who had,
even just for a moment, known you
thus you would be, but parcelled out, changeable,
contradictory, dependent, in intermittent light,
and once all those others are dead you would no longer be.
and, surely, here again the idea of afterlife borrows its very char-
acteristics from the world that was your life

you are, would say sometimes, the grave and its inside,
And the graved rock with your name
But this is nothing else to say:
alive, you was this body, dressed and undressed,
that body that kept your thought (or your soul)
And this body, too, were this name, yours.
Identity remains in the world only of this analog
you are, would say others, as you return
in their memory, if they remember, them
who have you, is just a moment, known
so you would be, but different, changeable, adversarial,
dependent, by eclipses,
And when each other will be dead, you would no longer be.

evenings of the world of your life

an iliad ago i was a little girl
a finger in every pie
and so my father christened me
‘the trafficker’ – or he recalled me rather.
and with that moniker
i stood up tall tall tall as a candle flame
and everything lit up even the pissing toad
trrapped deep inside my heart.
i trafficked microscopic elephants
and giant genuinely medieval ants
with a griffin’s grip
a lion’s mane
a fish’s tail
elastic brushes household zoo of wiles.
a trafficker i shipped out crockery
and knives-that-cut
and granny’s teeth
smeared my face red with birdsong geranium
grasshopper green and sky sky-blue.
summoned the frog and tortoise lettuce
snail and stolen
bright-red court-shoe quite attractive heel
from my mother also thanks to me mixed up
with needles pine-cones
cough-drops spittle rain.
and dealt in doilies hankies
i’d embroidered got myself lathered up
with a wild boar badger brush
hooked by the daddy-mystery i’d climb the curtains
terrrified up there purrched on the very edge
pink oilcloth with kitten’s head.
and what’s more trafficked in soup not ladlelike
that floating noodle shock of angels’ hair
with its cubes of gold let its die be cast:
run fast as i can from the boiling pan
with fire in my pants!
likewise i trrafficked in the round round eyes
of bears the rrag of dolls the colander the slotted spoon
the digitalis poison they call foxglove
in england deep as wellington boots
where i’d jump two feet at once good mornings drrenched
with water catch the miracle of passing clouds
and changing me the same.
a lonely dealer at the bottom of the garden or my head inside the wardrobe
while my parents rolled their tongues, ‘trr . . . trr . . . trr . . .’
they were the strangest creatures my papache my mamanche
i think i liked them
in that time of simple silly primaries
as if we really ever had a yellow sun.
and i came into their hands i grew
and what’s more soon went farther and farther than the bottom of the garden
than the back of the wardrobe bottom of the well
there was the moon too there in my life
not the one we trod on the other one
the luminous terrifying secret phoebe moon.
trr . . . trr . . . trr . . .
i chirped like a cricket to bring myself luck
or whatever was trruly happy trruly trruly
sometimes the satellite selene of the earth would smile at me
and i’d light up swing out high
like the smallest spider i used to believe
suspended in emptiness.
trr . . . trr . . . trr . . .
i scribble i scrunch it up
trr . . . trr . . . trr . . .
trr . . . trr . . . trr . . .
i note it down i chirrup my magic sounds
as long as the world astounds.

It's a long time I was a little child
And I was touching to everything
then ""trafficant"" my father baptized me
Or rather, he remembered me.
with this sobriquet
I become proud proud proud like a velage
everything would light even the peaper toad
Hide very in the depth of my heart.
I trafficed microscopic elephants
of the great ants of the true medium-age
With his feet crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying crying
to the lion's manor
At the finger's dog
from the sleek wisses, a tactical housework.
Trafficant as I walked the porcelain
The knives-the-knives-the-knives
Granny's teeth
And I were blooting in the geranium with a bird sing
I were verdishing myself as a satter, I were dazzling my sky.
I'd convoke the frog, the tortoise, the lait.

Stealing red heel not bad
to my mother, she's also trafficed by my care
Hands and pin apples
Puchous cratching cratching.
I was still trafiqued, we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll we'll
I were browling, I were making myself smoke
with a singular blood blaireau
Mystery pather to the curtains I was up
Up there, terror played as a catastrophe
And rose-waxed with a small face.
I trafficed the same the same it was too much
All this angel tignass which was drinking in it
with the cubes in golden is tossed the lot :
running with all bouillon legs
Or burn my pants!
I traficed itou's eyes of the round round tear
The doll's chiffon, the storm, the squire.
the digital poison named gunt-de-renard
in the deep angleterre like the rain boots
where the good mornings was jumped on my feet
To capture the wonder of the passing clouds
And change me the same.
Solitary traficant all in the depth of the garden or the nose in the arm
The parents would do ""tr . . . tr . . tr . . .""
Them were crazy crazy, faddy, my sleeper
I think I loved them
In this time with simple elemental colors
Idiot as if the sun really was yellow.
I came to their hands grow well
I was going even more and more far than the depth of the garden
just the depth of the ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring ring

on the French train at this time it's a blue left
it was once, it was once, it was once, it was it was it was it was it was it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's
(in the breeze of praha and then of cordoba I waiting for her to come back
I sow a concrete eden a garden to better make it court)
then the cap goes to the little train with the hands of the loved and I am very touched
If
(Previly to a good of friends I tow my rain suit by diving from a wall of the tuileries in a gray depth of cipress one night and I make on my shoes an almost melodius noise, then I scalade) I continue under the stars
(xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
An indian row of Ivoirians crosses with each other on the head a pay
(a fine broccoli package)
the court where the bad rose from a deep parpaing
(for her eyes, it's just for her eyes)
I want to say something of me to him and change
that phrase of black ants with its green or blue keeps that sway is immense aphro-paradisiac
he won't need to small his goggles to read my love
(xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
At four o'clock in the morning under the moon it comes out
In adam suit, my lover will blow the rose
the rose springs in the gray court
At four o' cloud under the moon the city could have seen it with the rose
So I slipped at his neck
just like a small as a small
The rose."

en m’endormant je voyais tout cela :
la chaleur et l’ellipse du puits,
la terre, où les feuilles n’ont plus de poids,
l’eau juste et médiane, qui balance.
je voyais, m’endormant, je voyais cela
que j’avais accueilli en des années
que je ne savais pas dans mon souvenir :
années entières, avec vérité,
c’est-à-dire, si on veut, avec mort.
je voulais, et je ne voulais pas, m’endormant,
voir ce que trop de fois j’avais vu.","that the world was there
falling asleep i saw the world was there,
the world and all that follows from it;
“now” smaller than a point
behind immense and serious colours.
buzzing years come back from afar,
angle of street and street,
traces washed off by rain,
yellow stuff gathered in my hand.
in falling asleep i saw all this:
the warm ellipse of the well,
the earth where leaves have no more weight,
the water, level, median, in balance.
i saw, falling asleep, i saw
what i had welcomed now for years
but what my memory did not know:
entire years with truth,
that is, if you insist, with death.
i did and did not want to see, falling asleep,
what i had seen too many times.",fr_XX,en_XX,"that the world was here

Burning years come back from afar,
angle of the street with the street,
erased traces under the rain,
Yellow material together in your hand.
As I sleep, I saw all this:
the heat and the ellipse of the well,
the earth, where the leaves no longer have a whole,
The water is just and medial, swinging.
I saw, sleeping, I saw that
that I had hold in years
that I didn't know in my memory:
Entire years, with truth,
It is, if we want, with death.
I wanted, and I didn't wanted, sleeping,
To see what too many times I had see."

les vieux, les grands enfants de la ville, rampent à plat ventre,
ils entrent dans leur maison de carton, sur les trottoirs,
et grouillent dans les recoins,
comme s’ils voulaient déjà se faire une place sous la terre.
ils se traînent sur une bouche de canalisation embuée
(c’est ainsi qu’ils renforcent leurs liens avec les profondeurs),
comme des poules géantes
qui couvent leurs fleurs, la moisissure.

the aged, the grown-up city children, crawl on their stomachs,
they enter their houses of cardboard, on the pavements,
and grub about in the corners,
as if already preparing their place underground.
they hang out on a blocked drainage exit
(which is how they strengthen their links with the depths),
like giant chickens
brooding over their flowers, putridity.
the grown-up, aged children of the city, crawl on their stomachs
and spit into the whitman of the street
as if into a soup.

just like a big hen
who cover their flowers, the most.

And scream in the whitman of the street
It's like in a supper.

Prettyly in a cloud, like angels."

beautiful, holding the cup that had been offered her,
drinking greedily to calm her thirst.

"mon portrait en zèbre
le zèbre est un animal peu commun.
ne pas me confondre avec le zabre, qui est un parasite des céréales s’attaquant
de nuit aux cultures, à la différence du zèbre, qui ne s’attaque aux cultures
que de jour.
la confiance est un aspect.
les jardins potagers sont faits pour les légumes.
le corps se compose d’une tête et de quatre membres rattachés au tronc par articulation.
l’articulation permet de changer de place. il y a aussi des déplacements à l’intérieur
du corps.
les animaux appartiennent à différentes espèces.
l’aspect prive d’un pouvoir de sécrétion.
le zébu est lui aussi un animal peu commun. il porte une bosse graisseuse sur le garrot.
il n’a pourtant pas connu la même fortune que moi, le zèbre.
la sécrétion forme une figure.
je dis toujours moi et je me sens être moi. la préférence que je nourris pour moi-même
n’est pas totalement exclusive, mais ellee reste très largement dominante.
il y a certainement des raisons à ce choix.
le corps est doué de mobilité.
la figure sert à la couture.
un zèbre est fait pour la course.
quand on court, le souffle devient court et précipité, le cœur bat plus fort, on peut
éprouver une suffocation.
la couture constitue une communauté.
l’initiale du mot zèbre suggère l’idée que le mouvement s’opère le plus souvent
en lignes brisées. car un mouvement continu en ligne droite s’en irait à l’infini,
ce qui est beaucoup trop loin. sagement, le zèbre ne circule qu’à l’intérieur
de ses propres limites.
la communauté montre du goût pour la communication.
cependant, comme l’animal n’est pas complètement borné, il garde un œil tourné
vers l’horizon.","portrait of myself as a zebra
the zebra is an uncommon animal.
do not confuse me with the zabrus, a cereal pest which raids crops at night, unlike the zebra,
which only raids crops in the daytime.
confidence is an aspect.
vegetable gardens are made for vegetables.
the body comprises a trunk and four limbs attached to the body by means of joints.
joints
make it possible to move around. movement also takes place inside the body.
animals belong to various species.
aspect deprives of a secretory power.
the zebu is also an uncommon animal. it has a fatty hump on its withers. nevertheless, it has not
been so successful as i, the zebra.
secretion forms a dummy.
i always say me and i feel myself being me. my preference for myself is not totally exclusive,
but remains largely dominant. there are certainly reasons for that choice.
the body is endowed with mobility.
the dummy is used for sewing.
zebras are made for running.
when you run, breathing becomes short and precipitate, the heart beats harder and there
may be a feeling of suffocation.
sewing forms a community.
the initial of the word zebra suggests that movement takes place most often in a broken line.
this is because a continuous movement in a straight line would go on for ever, which is
much too far. wisely, the zebra moves only within its own limits.
the community displays a taste for communication.
however, as the animal does not have an utterly limited mind, it keeps an eye turned toward
the horizon.",fr_XX,en_XX,"my portrait in zebra
The zebra is a rare animal.
do not confuse me with the zabre, who is a cereater's parsy following
by night to cultures, to the difference of the zebra, that doesn't follow to cultures
it's nothing but day.
Trust is an aspect.
Gardens are potable and are made for weeds.
The body is coming with a head and four bigs to the tronc by joint.
Articulation can change place. There are also travels inside

the animal belongs to different species.
the deprived aspect of a secretive power.
The zebu is also a little animal. He wears a gray hump on the garrot.
But he didn't know the same bounty as I have, the zebra.
The secretion forms a figure.
I always say me and I feel I am. the preference that I follow for myself
it's not totally exclusive, but it's almost domains.
There are certain reasons for this choice.
the body is well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well well
The figure serves to sew.
A zebra is made for the race.
when we run, the blow becomes short and hurt, the heart beats stronger, we can
trying suffocation.
Sewing is a community.
The initial of the zebra word suggests the idea that the movement is most of the time
In broken lines. 'Cause a constant movement in a right line would go to infinite,
what's too far away. Saidly, the zebra rolls only inside
from its own limits.
The community shows a taste for communication.
howver, as the animal is not totally started, it keeps an eyes turned
towards the horizon."

5. d’où il résulte que tous les là-bas à la fois qui ne sont pas ici n’existent pas ici.
6. et donc le monde n’existe pas. sauf ici.
7. ‘allez voir là-bas si j’y suis’ est un ordre difficile à exécuter.
8. tout ce qui est là-bas ne vient jamais ici, sauf si on va l’y chercher et qu’on y reste.
9. la valeur d’ici varie en fonction d’ici. ‘docteur j’ai mal ici’ ne désigne pas le même ici que ‘ici en europe’, ‘ici en europe’ inclut ‘docteur j’ai mal ici’ si le mal et si le docteur sont ‘ici en europe’. il découle que ‘docteur j’ai mal ici’ ne désigne pas le même ici que ‘ici en europe’ même si ‘docteur j’ai mal ici’ se trouve ‘ici en europe’. il existe donc une relation d’inclusion entre plusieurs ici puisque ici est toujours inclus dans un plus grand ici que lui.
10. d’où l’on déduit que chaque ici est constitué d’une infinité d’ici qui s’emboîtent les uns dans les autres comme des poupées russes, même en europe.
11. cette relation n’est pas réciproque (‘ici en europe’ inclut ‘j’ai mal ici’, mais ‘j’ai mal ici’ n’inclut pas ‘ici en europe’).
12. si celui qui a ‘mal ici’ téléphone depuis la chine au docteur qui est ‘en europe’, la relation entre ces deux ici est une relation dite télédiagnosticale spacio-décalée. parce que ‘j’ai mal ici’ est inclus dans ‘ici en chine’ et que le docteur qui se trouve ‘ici en europe’ doit diagnostiquer le ‘mal ici’ qui n’est pas ‘ici en europe’.
13. deux ici = 1 là-bas qui n’est pas ici + 1 ici qui n’est pas là-bas (sauf pour là-bas).
14. si pour ici, là-bas = là-bas, pour là-bas, ici = là-bas, mais pour là-bas, là-bas n’égale pas forcément ici.
15. les milliers de là-bas qui sont là-bas pour les autres là-bas n’existent pas pour ces autres là-bas qui n’existent pas pour ici.
16. la totalité des autres là-bas correspond à la totalité des potentiels d’ici.
17. un là-bas n’égale jamais un autre là-bas même si pour ici, deux là-bas distincts sont indistinctement là-bas.
18. chaque là-bas est le là-bas de tous les autres là-bas à la fois.
19. la frontière entre ici et là-bas n’est pas très nette.
20. l’énoncé ‘je suis là-bas est une impossibilité logique, comme par exemple ‘il a ses ragnagnas. – ca sent un drôle de bruit - la première fois que je suis allé à new york c’était en californie – nous avons trois fils uniques – je pèse 1,81 m – je les compte sur les doigts de la hanche – ma mère est encore pucelle – ouvert 24 heures sur 24 jusqu’à 22h30 – j’ai assassiné le frère unique de ma sœur – 97% des personnes interrogées étaient en vie – nouveaux horaires pour le troisième semestre – les jumeaux jean-pierre ont dix mois d’écart – on vient de donner le départ de la traversée de l’amérique à la nage – il a gagné le tour de france des bouches-du-rhône – la marine autrichienne, elle vous dit merde. – à rotterdam, seuls les poètes néerlandais ne sont pas des poètes internationaux.’
21. un seul ici pour deux là-bas est une aberration logique. ou alors c’est la guerre.","here and there
1. the world is all that is there.
2. the totality of the world is the totality of theres of the world minus one there that is here.
3. here is the sum of all the theres minus all the theres minus one.
4. seen from there, there will always be one there missing from the totality of theres of the world, and that missing there is here. so that one cannot conceive a universe comprised of there only. however, all that is not here does not exist.
5. from which it follows that all the theres which are at the same time not here do not exist here.
6. and thus the world does not exist. save here.
7. ‘look over there and see if i am there’ is an order difficult to follow.
8. all that is there never comes here, save if one should go there to look for it and remain there.
9. the value of here varies according to here. ‘doctor, i have a pain here’ does not designate the same here as ‘here in europe’, ‘here in europe’ includes ‘doctor, i have a pain here’ if the pain and the doctor are both ‘here in europe.’ it follows that ‘doctor, i have a pain here’ does not designate the same here as ‘here in europe’ even if ‘doctor, i have a pain here’ should happen to be ‘here in europe.’ there exists therefore a relation of inclusion between many heres, since here is always included in a here larger than it.
10. from which it will be deduced that each here consists of an infinity of heres all nested in each other like matryoshka dolls, even in europe.
11. this relation is not reciprocal (‘here in europe’ includes ‘i have a pain here,’ but ‘i have a pain here’ does not include ‘here in europe’).
12. if he who has ‘a pain here’ telephones from china for a doctor who is ‘in europe,’ here the relation between the two is a relation known as space-shifted telediagnostical, since ‘i have a pain here’ is included in ‘here in china’ and the doctor who happens to be ‘here in europe’ must diagnose the ‘pain here’ that is not ‘here in europe.’
13. two heres = 1 there who is not here + 1 here who is not there (except there).
14. if for here there = there, for there here = there; but for there, there does not necessarily equal here.
15. the thousands of theres which are there for other people over there do not exist for these other people over there who do not exist for here.
16. the totality of other people over there corresponds to the totality of the potentials of here.
17. one there never equals another, even if for here two distinct theres are indistinctly there.
18. each there is the there of all the other theres at once.
19. the frontier between here and there is not very neat.
20. the statement ‘i am there’ is a logical impossibility, similar for example to the statements ‘he is on his period. that noise feels funny. the first time i went to new york it was in california. we have three only sons. i weigh 1.81 metres. i count them on the fingers of my hip. my mother is still a virgin. open 24 hours until 10.30. i assassinated my sister’s only brother. 97% of the persons interrogated were alive. new timetables for the third half of the year. the andrews twins are ten months older than each other. i have given the go-ahead for the big swim across america. he won the tour de france of the bouches-du-rhône. the austrian navy, it claims that you are shit. in rotterdam, only the dutch poets are not international.’
21. just one here for two there is a logical aberration. or it is the war.",fr_XX,en_XX,"here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here,
1. The world is all that is there.
2. The entire of the world is the entire of there of the world less one there that is here.
3. here is the sum of all there less all there less one.
4. Seen from there, it always misses one there to the totality of there of the world, and that there misses is here. so well that we can't envisage a universe only composed of there. or everything that is not here doesn't exist.
5. from where it seems that all there that are not here doesn't exist here.
6. And the world doesn't exist except here.
7. Go and see there if I'm in there is an order hard to execute.
8. Everything that is there never comes here, except if we go and look for it and we stay for it.
9. The worth of here is different in relation to here. ‘Doctor, I have pain here, doesn't sign the same here as ‘here in Europe,' here in Europe, ‘here in Europe, inclects ‘doctor, I have pain here if the pain and if the doctor are ‘here in Europe.' it seems that ‘doctor, I have pain here, doesn't sign the same here as ‘here in Europe, even if 'doctor, I have pain here's here here as ‘here in Europe.' there existes a relation of inclustive between many here, since here is always parted in a great here.
10. from where we sure that each other here is becomed of an infinited once here that fit into each others like ruse dolls, even in Europe.
11. this relation is not reciprocate ('here in Europe' includes ‘I'm in pain here, but ‘here' doesn't include ‘here in Europe').
12. if the one who has ‘wrong here's phoned from China to the doctor who is ‘in Europe,' the relation becoming these two here's it's a so-called spacio-scaled teledignostic relation. 'Cause ‘I'm in pain here's it's it's it's it's it's in China and that the doctor who is it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's
13. two here = 1 here that's not here + 1 here that's not here (except for there).
14. if for here, there = there, there = there, there = there, but for here, there doesn't necess equal here.
15. the thousands of there that are there for the others there do not exist for these others there that do not exist for there.
16. the totality of the others there corresponds to the totality of the potentials of there.
17. one there never equals one there even if for here, two distinct there are indistinctly there.
18. each other there is there of all the others there again.
19 The behest between here and there is not very clear.
20. The declame ‘I'm there is a illogic impossible, like for example ‘he has his ragnagnagnas.' – it feels a funny noise – the first time I got to new york it was in california – we have three unique sons – I weight 1.81 m – I tell them on the fingers of the hip – my mother is still pucelle – open 24 hours after 10:30 a.m. – I assassinated my sister's unique brother – 97% of the people questioned were in life – new hours for the three sixths – the jean-pire jumes have ten months of distance – we have just given the left of the travel of the americ to the swim – he won the france turn of the mouths of the rhône – the Austrian marine, she says to you. – in rotterdam, only the Dutch poets are not international poets.
21. Alone here for two here is a logical aberration. Or so it's war."
"je m’éveillai, c’était la maison natale.
il pleuvait doucement dans toutes les salles,
j’allais d’une à une autre, regardant
l’eau qui étincelait sur les miroirs
amoncelés partout, certains brisés ou même
poussés entre des meubles et les murs.
c’était de ces reflets que, parfois, un visage
se dégageait, riant, d’une douceur
de plus et autrement que ce qu’est le monde.
et je touchais, hésitant, dans l’image
les mèches désordonnées de la déesse,
je découvrais sous le voile de l’eau
son front triste et distrait de petite fille.
étonnement entre être et ne pas être,
main qui hésite à toucher la buée,

the water that shone on the mirrors
piled up everywhere, some broken or even
pushed between the furniture and the walls.
it was from these reflections that sometimes a face
would emerge, laughing, of a gentleness
that was different from what the world is.
and, with a hesitant hand, i touched in the image
the tossled hair of the goddess,
beneath the veil of the water
i could see the sad, distracted face of a little girl.
bewilderment between being and not being,
hand that is reluctant to touch the mist,
then i listened as the laughter faded away
in the halls of the empty house.

The dispercy wicks of the godness,

his sad and dispended front of a little girl.
Astonishment between being and not being,
hand that heckless to touch the drink,
And then I was hearing the laughter going away
In the halls of the deserted house.

il faisait nuit encore. de l’eau glissait
silencieusement sur le sol noir,

que de me souvenir, et je riais,

a pile of branches and leaves,
i lifted up the whole dripping mass
in arms i held close to my heart.

the sound of color rose from so much absence,

souffrances.

temps perclus. devant vos yeux majestueux j\'éteignais ma
fureur réticente. le vide de londres m\'engouffrait.

collines du doute ?

mais comment se soulager ?

oublie les souffrances néfastes,
les émotions mélancoliques et taciturnes
devant la condition humaine estompée.
j\'ai souffert tant des jours palissants.
depuis longtemps
j\'étais tout seul à semer la confusion
entre le mutisme français
l\'éloquence anglaise
et la rhétorique arabe
aussi bien que les tournures émanées par mes écrits
et les structures incontrolables très expurgées.
en chassant l\'intrépide de la guèrre du brouillard londonien

washed by waves under a dormant sun.
i am like an unleashed soul,
crossing the savage dunes of time, where the grape harvests of
the cursed spirit
propels against the race of the ogres .
i am like a knowing soul
troubled by a stagnant anxiety
resuscitating the victorious revolt of my sufferance.
i am like a perfidious soul ,
betrayed by the old age of the impotent time
in front of your mystic gaze,
i extinguished my reticent furore,
drowned myself in the emptiness of london .
when will the torch of grace shed light
on my mountains of doubt?
someone said to me : calm yourself !
but how do i calm down ?
forget the pains inflicted by the delusion?
forget the ill-fated sufferance?
the taciturn and melancholic emotion
in front of entombed human condition.
i suffered so much in those faded days,
since long time,
i was alone to sow the seeds of confusion
between french mutism ( silence )
english eloquence
and arabic rhetoric
although the verses emanated from my writing
and the erratic structures were to be ruthlessly censored
in chasing the intrepid battle of the london fog ,
which has defaced the eternal sky,
i remember the atrocity of the hazardous seas
where foam of my life was washed away by the angry waves.
incarcerated between two virgin stars
the forbidden fruit to foreigners
sank deep into this muddy world.
rain or snow covering my immense sky.
i came to offer you my odyssey ,
i came to sing you my rhapsody.
as an innocent prey,
i was blinded by a condemned love.
who are you, day of enslaved solitude?
who sent you to me?
you, the deaf mute, have you reached the age of reasoning
for understanding the rhythm of the silence?
whereas to me , i am accustomed to the shackled thirst ,
where lugubrious autumn of quivering and withered leaves
rendered me vague satisfaction.
here i am , an immigrant against my will,
dissipated in this impregnable citadel,
my anguished itinerary
like a stray cat under a twinkling star
dancing to the rhythm of the dawn of a no-man’s land.
immortal glory to the living thinkers of a locked utopia,
who are dying under the gag of the bestial justice
and under the deceiving eyes of a glinding vulture.
glory to the sanguine spirits,
glory to the mordant lips without rancour,
glory to the feelings buried in this eternal infinity.
immigrants of all nations, unleash your reins,

c’est tout de même curieux, un objet sans ombre.
faute d’avoir une ombre, je pensais vaguement que chaque mot avait son opposé,
son antonyme. je pensais trop vaguement : tous les mots n’ont pas d’antonyme.
un mot qui n’a pas d’antonyme me paraît, comme un corps sans ombre, une curieuse anomalie.
la température appartient à un ordre.
pourtant, il en est bien ainsi.
j’ai tenté de comprendre ce que peut recouvrir cette notion d’antonyme. jusqu’à présent,
elle me paraît assez floue.
homme est antonyme de femme, et réciproquement, mais fille et garçon ne sont pas antonymes.
d’ailleurs fils non plus n’a pas d’antonyme. il semble
qu’on ne naisse pas antonyme de l’autre sexe, mais qu’on le devienne
par les opérations de conjugaison.
contrairement à ce que j’aurais pensé a priori (mais apparemment, j’avais à ce sujet
toutes sortes d’idées fausses) l’antonymie ne fonctionne pas seulement
par couple, loin de là. chez les antonymes, la polygamie semble
correspondre à la norme, et la monogamie fait figure d’exception. dans tous les cas,
cependant, existent des systèmes non clos, du type hier,
aujourd’hui, demain. hier et demain sont antonymes d’aujourd’hui, aujourd’hui
et demain sont antonymes d’hier, mais seul aujourd’hui est antonyme
de demain. en effet, hier n’est pas l’antonyme de demain, le passé
n’étant pas l’exact opposé du futur.
forme a de nombreux antonymes, dont fond, et sujet, qui de leur côté n’ont pas d’antonyme.

words fill the whole universe, like light, but unlike light they have no shadow.
the chorus causes the temperature to drop.
how very strange, an object without a shadow.
since i had no shadow, i vaguely thought that each word had its opposite, its antonym. i thought too
vaguely: not all words have antonyms.
a word without an antonym seems to me, like a body without a shadow, a curious anomaly.
temperature is part of an order.
nevertheless, that is so.
i have tried to understand what is meant by this concept of antonym. up to now, it has seemed
rather vague to me.
man is the antonym of woman, and vice versa, but girl and boy are not antonyms. indeed,
son has no antonym either. it would seem that one is not born the antonym of the other sex,
but that one becomes so though the processes of conjugation.
contrary to what i would
have thought beforehand (although it seems i had all sorts of wrong ideas
on the subject), antonymy does not only operate in couples, far from it. with antonyms,
polygamy appears to be the norm, and monogamy stands as an exception.
in all cases, however, non-closed systems exist, such as yesterday, today,
tomorrow. yesterday and tomorrow are antonyms of today, today and tomorrow
are antonyms of yesterday, but only today is the antonym of tomorrow. yesterday
is not the antonym of tomorrow, as the past is not the exact opposite of the future.

A word that has no antonym seems to me, like a body without shadow, a curious anomaly.

But it's the way it's the way it is.
I've tried to understand what this notion of antonym can recoup. So far,
She looks fully to me.
Man is antonym of a woman, and vicerely, but girl and boy are not antonyms.
now son doesn't have an anthenyma. it seems
that we are not born antonyme from the other sex, but that we become it
by conjugation operations.
Contrary to what I would have thought aprie (but seemely, I had about this
All ways of misconceptions) Anthonia doesn't work only
By couple, far from there. In the antonymes, polygamy seems
to conform to the standard, and monogamy is an exception. in all cases,
But, there exist unclosed systems, of the type yesterday,

voûté comme il était déjà mais redressant
son regard vers l’inaccompli ou l’impossible.

la demande du rêve, mais il sort
et aussitôt l’enfant maladroit prend les cartes,
il substitue à celles de l’autre jeu
toutes les cartes gagnantes, puis il attend
avec fièvre, que la partie reprenne, et que celui
qui perdait gagne, et si glorieusement
qu’il y voie comme un signe, et de quoi nourrir
il ne sait, lui l’enfant, quelle espérance.

se perd, et presque tout de suite, et ce sera

he was motionless, looking for something,
i could not tell what, or where, beyond the world,
his body was already bent over, but his gaze
was lifted toward the unaccomplished or the impossible.

was wandering about with some of my classmates
at the beginning of an afternoon still free from time.
to this figure, seen from afar, moving on its way,
i dedicate the words that cannot say what they would.

cards, since these are the only pictures
in the childhood house to satisfy
the needs of dream, but he leaves,
and when he does, the child clumsily takes the cards,
he puts the winning ones in the other’s hand,
then waits feverishly for the game to begin again,
and for the one who was losing to win, and so triumphantly
that he might see in this victory a sign, something
to nourish some hope the child cannot know.

vanishes, and almost immediately, forgetfulness
sets in, avid, relentless.

i am lying in the hollow of a boat,
my forehead and eyes against the curved planks
where i can hear the undercurrents
striking the bottom of the boat.
all at once, the prow rises up,
and i think that we’ve come to the estuary,
but i keep my eyes against the wood
that smells of tar and glue.
too vast, too luminous the images
that i have gathered in my sleep.
why rediscover, outside,
the things that words tell me of,
but without convincing me,
i desire a higher or less somber shore.
and yet i give up this ground that stirs
beneath the body waking to itself, i get up,
i go from room to room in the house,
they are endless now,
i can hear the cries of voices behind doors,
i am seized by these sorrows that knock
against the ruined casings, i hurry on,
the lingering night is too heavy for me,
frightened, i go into a room cluttered with desks,
look, i’m told, this was your classroom,
see on the walls the first images you looked at,
look, the tree, look, there, the yelping dog,
and the geography map on the yellow wall,
this fading of names and forms,
this effacing of mountains and rivers
by the whiteness that freezes language.
look, this was your only book. the isis of the plaster
on the wall of this room, which is pealing away,
never had, nor ever will have anything other
to open for you, to close on you.",fr_XX,en_XX,"Gold, in the same dream

But I keep my eyes against the wood
who scents of tar and cold.
The images are too large, too lighty,
that I accumuld in my sleep.
why to see, outside,
things that the words speak to me, but without persuading,
I desire high or less dark bank.
And yet I'm giving up on this moving soil
under the body that looks, I stand,
I go to the house from room to room,
There are now innumerable,
I hear the voice behind the door,
I'm seemed by the pains that know
To the chambranles that devay, I hurried,
too heavy is the night that is long, I come in scared
It's in a clumsy room with tabletops,
You can see, I'm told, it was the classroom,
see on the walls your first images,
See, it's the tree, see, it's the dog through,
And this geographer's map, on the wall
yellow, this desloration of name and form,
that disappointment of the mountains, of the rivers,
by the whiteness that translates the word,
You see, it was your only book. The behest of pleasure.
from the wall of this room, that shushes,

dans un milieu orphelin.
tout le monde qui m\'entourais était aussi orphelin.
dieu a crée le père et la mère,
et la société a concu l\'orphelinat.
chez nous la misère était très rigoureuse.
j\'ai bu des larmes chaudes et salées.
j\'ai vêcu l\'éternité rauque.
a oujda, lyon, paris et londres,
j\'ai vu naitre la lumière dérrière l\'horizon marocain
foudroyé par la solitude nocturne.
j\'ai vu le néant.
j\'ai vêcu l\'endurance et l\'exile odieux.
corps à corps, sous i\'ombre de i\'araignée géante
des murs concaves.
dans mes rêves matinaux ;
j\'attendais avec ferveur la tombée des jours creux.
le temps passait très vite et avec lassitude.
j\'ai vu naitre des jours évasifs.
c\'etait mon refuge monotone.
c\'etait l\'absolu de mon espace opaque.
chaque jour,
j\'avance parmi les naufragés de l\'abime vide.
sous la douleur amère, mes larmes furtives s\'engouffraient.
j\'ai vu naitre l\'univers et son éclipse.
son silence sombre et abstrait tourmentait mon âme.
et mes rêves,
j\'ai succombé mille fois sans prendre conscience.
mais l\'asile de mon existence est devenu téméraire.
moi qui cherche i\'euphorie dans les étoiles de cet univers
lointain.
et comme le calme des nuits nonchalantes,
j\'ai poussé un soupir mordant
sous l\'arc du désarroi.

i was born an orphan
amidst other orphans
god created our parents
society conceived a home for the abandoned
at this home of stifling misery
drunken with my own tears hot and salty
i suffer in this raucous eternity.
in oujda, lyon , paris and london
i witnessed the light arising behind the moroccan horizon
but it was soon darkened
by the nocturnal solitude
within which i saw only the oblivion
i have been living in endurance and sufferance
hand to mouth , under the shadow of a gigantic spider
sprawling over a sunken wall.
in my dreams of dawns
i await with fervour, the hollow days fall
time passed swiftly in languor
i saw birth of evasive days
such was my monotonous refuge
such was the end of my opaque space.
each day
i sank deeper into the wreckage of the vacuous abyss
under an insufferable pain , engulfed in my furtive tears.
i saw birth of universe and its eclipse,
its sombre and abstract silence tormented my spirit.
in my dreams,
i’ve succumbed thousand times without regaining
consciousness,
but the sanctuary of my existence had become apathetic.
i, who search euphoria in the stars of this universe far away,
like the calm of the nonchalant nights,
i let go of a mordant sigh
under the arc of disarray.
i feel this desire to live, and to relive,
once again, my unhappy and sparing childhood days.
i always believed that the unfinished human duel
must save archaic stimulation
and the ancient evil that universe exerted upon us
and the total negation of the individual ,
to convince this society of recluses.
here i was again ,
in quest of incense in the centre of my enigma,
there i found self interest in my divine destiny,
i was thereafter insipid.
blinded by hatred,
so intense that my heart pounded at a casual love but
i, did not wish to die without acquiring the transcendental
wisdom,
because i abhor lies
subdued by the doctrine of contempt and of sorcery.
and giant’s steps, the time reversed across the migrating
twilight
o, wise king of the torrential rain,
of the streaming rivers , of gigantic mountains, of rebellious
wind

a bunch of green holly and blooming heather.",fr_XX,en_XX,"Tomorrow, from dawn
Tomorrow, from dawn, to the time which the land lands,
I'll go. Do you see, I know you're waiting for me.
I'll go by the forest, I'll go by the mountain.
I can't stay far from you no longer.
I'll walk my eyes on my thoughts,
without seeing anything on the outside, without hearing anynoise,
alone, unknown, his back curved, his hands crossed,
Sad, and the day for me will be like the night.
I willn't look at the evening gold that falls,
Or the veils in the distance going down to the storm,
And when I arrive, I'll put on your grave
a buquet of green houx and small in flower."

i dreamt of tom thumb and picked my rhymes from the road:

when those balmy september evenings applied,

lure upon deck an unlucky albatross, one of those vast
birds of the sea that follow unwearied the voyage through,

than this aerial colossus, shorn of his pride,
goes hobbling pitiably across the planks and lets
his great wings hang like heavy, useless oars at his side.
how droll is the poor floundering creature, how limp and weak —
he, but a moment past so lordly, flying in state!
they tease him: one of them tries to stick a pipe in his beak;
another mimics with laughter his odd lurching gait.

a rider of storms, above the range of arrows and slings;
exiled on earth, at bay amid the jeering crowd,
he cannot walk for his unmanageable wings.",fr_XX,en_XX,"often, to have fun, the men of the team

Exiled on the ground in the middles,
His wings of a girl stop it from waiting."

"j’ai voulu ce matin te rapporter des roses ;

he opened beak wide and let go of his plunder.

"ainsi, toujours poussés vers de nouveaux rivages,
dans la nuit éternelle emportés sans retour,
ne pourrons-nous jamais sur l’océan des âges
jeter l’ancre un seul jour ?
ô lac ! l’année à peine a fini sa carrière,
et près des flots chéris qu’elle devait revoir,
regarde ! je viens seul m’asseoir sur cette pierre
où tu la vis s’asseoir !
tu mugissais ainsi sous ces roches profondes,
ainsi tu te brisais sur leurs flancs déchirés,
ainsi le vent jetait l’écume de tes ondes
sur ses pieds adorés.
un soir, t’en souvient-il ? nous voguions en silence ;
on n’entendait au loin, sur l’onde et sous les cieux,
que le bruit des rameurs qui frappaient en cadence
tes flots harmonieux.
tout à coup des accents inconnus à la terre
du rivage charmé frappèrent les échos ;
le flot fut attentif, et la voix qui m’est chère
laissa tomber ces mots :
” ô temps ! suspends ton vol, et vous, heures propices !
suspendez votre cours :
laissez-nous savourer les rapides délices
des plus beaux de nos jours !
” assez de malheureux ici-bas vous implorent,
coulez, coulez pour eux ;
prenez avec leurs jours les soins qui les dévorent ;
oubliez les heureux.
” mais je demande en vain quelques moments encore,
le temps m’échappe et fuit ;
je dis à cette nuit : sois plus lente ; et l’aurore
va dissiper la nuit.
” aimons donc, aimons donc ! de l’heure fugitive,
hâtons-nous, jouissons !
l’homme n’a point de port, le temps n’a point de rive ;
il coule, et nous passons ! “
temps jaloux, se peut-il que ces moments d’ivresse,
où l’amour à longs flots nous verse le bonheur,
s’envolent loin de nous de la même vitesse
que les jours de malheur ?
eh quoi ! n’en pourrons-nous fixer au moins la trace ?
quoi ! passés pour jamais ! quoi ! tout entiers perdus !
ce temps qui les donna, ce temps qui les efface,
ne nous les rendra plus !
éternité, néant, passé, sombres abîmes,
que faites-vous des jours que vous engloutissez ?
parlez : nous rendrez-vous ces extases sublimes
que vous nous ravissez ?
ô lac ! rochers muets ! grottes ! forêt obscure !
vous, que le temps épargne ou qu’il peut rajeunir,
gardez de cette nuit, gardez, belle nature,
au moins le souvenir !
qu’il soit dans ton repos, qu’il soit dans tes orages,
beau lac, et dans l’aspect de tes riants coteaux,
et dans ces noirs sapins, et dans ces rocs sauvages
qui pendent sur tes eaux.
qu’il soit dans le zéphyr qui frémit et qui passe,
dans les bruits de tes bords par tes bords répétés,
dans l’astre au front d’argent qui blanchit ta surface
de ses molles clartés.
que le vent qui gémit, le roseau qui soupire,
que les parfums légers de ton air embaumé,
que tout ce qu’on entend, l’on voit ou l’on respire,
tout dise : ils ont aimé !","so driven onward to new shores forever,
into the night eternal swept away,
upon the sea of time can we not ever
drop anchor for one day?
o lake! scarce has a single year coursed past.
to waves that she was meant to see again,
i come alone to sit upon this stone
you saw her sit on then.
you lowed just so below those plunging cliffs.
just so you broke about their riven flanks.
just so the wind flung your spray forth to wash
her feet which graced your banks.
recall the evening we sailed out in silence?
on waves beneath the skies, afar and wide,
naught but the rowers’ rhythmic oars we heard
stroking your tuneful tide.
then of a sudden tones untold on earth,
resounded round the sounding spellbound sea.
the tide attended; and i heard these words
from the voice dear to me:
pause in your trek o time! pause in your flight,
favorable hours, and stay!
let us enjoy the transient delight
that fills our fairest day.
unhappy crowds cry out to you in prayers.
flow, time, and set them free.
run through their days and through their ravening cares!
but leave the happy be.
in vain i pray the hours to linger on
and time slips into flight.
i tell this night: “be slower!” and the dawn
undoes the raveled night.
let’s love, then! love, and feel while feel we can
the moment on its run.
there is no shore of time, no port of man.
it flows, and we go on.
covetous time! our mighty drunken moments
when love pours forth huge floods of happiness;
can it be true that they depart no faster
than days of wretchedness?
why can we not keep some trace at the least?
gone wholly? lost forever in the black?
will time that gave them, time that now elides them
never once bring them back?
eternity, naught, past, dark gulfs: what do
you do with days of ours which you devour?
speak! shall you not bring back those things sublime?
return the raptured hour?
o lake, caves, silent cliffs and darkling wood,
whom time has spared or can restore to light,
beautiful nature, let there live at least
the memory of that night:
let it be in your stills and in your storms,
fair lake, in your cavorting sloping sides,
in the black pine trees, in the savage rocks
that hang above your tides;
let it be in the breeze that stirs and passes,
in sounds resounding shore to shore each night,
in the star’s silver countenance that glances
your surface with soft light.
let the deep keening winds, the sighing reeds,
let the light balm you blow through cliff and grove,
let all that is beheld or heard or breathed
say only “they did love.”",fr_XX,en_XX,"so, always hurted to new banks,
in the everything night, without returning,
Will we never be able on the ocean of the age
To hut the tear only one day?

And near the loved flowers that she had to see again,
look! I come alone to sit on this rock
where do you live her to sit!
you was mugissing so under these depthing rocks,
And so you broke on their towsides,
so the wind throught the scum of your waves
on his loved feet.
one evening, do you remember it? we walked in silence;
We didn't hear in the distance, on the wand and under the skys,
just the noise of the girls that beat in cadence
It's your well-well-well-well-well-well-well-well-well-well-well-well-well-well-well-well-well-well-well-well-well-well-
Suddenly unknown accents to the earth
On the charmed bank, the echos came;
the flow was heavenful, and the voice that before me
He left these words:
Oh, time! Stop your flying, and you, hours affordable!
stop your course:
Let us savor the rapid delights
The most beautifuls of our days!
Suffering many women here ask you,
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
take with their days the cares that enjoy them;
Forget the happy.
But I enquire in vain a few more moments,
time eludes me and fless me;
I say to tonight: be slower; and the dawn
it's going to dissip the night.
let's love, let's love, let's love, let's love, let's love, let's love, let's love, let's love, let's love, let's love, let's love, let's love, let's love, let's love, let's love, let's love, let's love, let's love, let's love
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on,
Man doesn't have a port, time doesn't have a rive;
it's pouring, and we're going by !
Jealous time, it is possible those moments of intoxication,
where love with long flows pours happiness to us,
Fly away from us from the same fast
just the days of unhappy?
Hey, what, can't we take a take of it?
what! past forever! what! what! what! what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what w
that time that gave them, that time that erases them,
Will no longer give them back to us!
Eternity, nothing, past, dark grounds,
What do you do with the days you're swrinkling?
Tell: Will you give us these sublime ecstases
that you're raving us?
Oh, lake, much rocks, groves, dark forest.
you, what time sparing or it can rejuvene,
keep of this night, keep, beautiful nature,
At least the memory!
May he be in your repose, May he be in your storms,
beautiful lake, and in the face of your laughant,
And in these black firts, and in these wild rocks
that live on your waters.
May it be in the zephyr that screezes and that pass,
In the noises of your beds by your repetited beds,
in the astre with a silver front which launds your surface
with its slow lights.
the wind that groans, the reed that sweeps,
just the light perfumes of your embalmed air,
that everything we hear, we see or we breath,
everything says: they loved!"

sourirait un enfant malade, il fait un somme:

And the nave whishing in the fresh blue crease,

"bientôt nous plongerons dans les froides ténèbres;
adieu, vive clarté de nos étés trop courts !
j’entends déjà tomber avec des chocs funèbres
le bois retentissant sur le pavé des cours.
tout l’hiver va rentrer dans mon être: colère,
haine, frissons, horreur, labeur dur et forcé,
et, comme le soleil dans son enfer polaire,
mon cœur ne sera plus qu’un bloc rouge et glacé.
j’écoute en frémissant chaque bûche qui tombe;
l’échafaud qu’on bâtit n’a pas d’écho plus sourd.
mon esprit est pareil à la tour qui succombe
sous les coups du bélier infatigable et lourd.
ii me semble, bercé par ce choc monotone,
qu’on cloue en grande hâte un cercueil quelque part.
pour qui ? — c’était hier l’été; voici l’automne !
ce bruit mystérieux sonne comme un départ.
j’aime de vos longs yeux la lumière verdâtre,
douce beauté, mais tout aujourd’hui m’est amer,
et rien, ni votre amour, ni le boudoir, ni l’âtre,
ne me vaut le soleil rayonnant sur la mer.
et pourtant aimez-moi, tendre cœur ! soyez mère,
même pour un ingrat, même pour un méchant;
amante ou sœur, soyez la douceur éphémère
d’un glorieux automne ou d’un soleil couchant.

goûter, en regrettant l’été blanc et torride,
de l’arrière-saison le rayon jaune et doux !","soon we shall plunge into the cold darkness;
farewell, vivid brightness of our short-lived summers!
already i hear the dismal sound of firewood
falling with a clatter on the courtyard pavements.
all winter will possess my being: wrath,
hate, horror, shivering, hard, forced labor,
and, like the sun in his polar hades,
my heart will be no more than a frozen red block.
all atremble i listen to each falling log;
the building of a scaffold has no duller sound.
my spirit resembles the tower which crumbles
under the tireless blows of the battering ram.
it seems to me, lulled by these monotonous shocks,
that somewhere they’re nailing a coffin, in great haste.
for whom? — yesterday was summer; here is autumn
that mysterious noise sounds like a departure.

sweet beauty, but today all to me is bitter;
nothing, neither your love, your boudoir, nor your hearth
is worth as much as the sunlight on the sea.

even to an ingrate, even to a scapegrace;
mistress or sister, be the fleeting sweetness
of a gorgeous autumn or of a setting sun.

even for an ingrate, even for an evil;
love or sister, be the ephemeral sweet
of a glorious autumn or of a sleeping sun.
Short work! The grave's waiting; it's avid!
ah, leave me, my front on your knees,
taste, regretting the white and torrid summer,
from the backstory the yellow and sweet ray!"
