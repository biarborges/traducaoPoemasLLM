"uma canção póstuma para paul celan
onde vieres também tu a sussurrar nas valas, nem que faminta esteja a tua voz
e se teus olhos os vir de madrugada, perdidos pelos campos, em sítios que estremecem — eu regresso — «eu
até nas ondas do meio-dia, na linha calma das cerejas, se te vejo, margarete — eu « escureço — «e escureço
como o cabelo com o tom escuro dos violinos me escurece, como
escurece o vento nos bosques frios em que morremos, escurecem as alamedas
escurece o leite negro que bebemos e bebemos.
onde vieres também tu pelo adordo sublime do infortúnio, nem que franzido seja o teu sangue
e se teus lábios os vir ao entardecer, à hora mágica, lendo os poemas da galícia — eu regresso — «eu
até nos combóios que cavam um túmulo pelos ares, se te vejo, sulamith — eu «escureço — «e escureço
como o entardecer nas horas mais pequenas me escurece, como
escurecem as rugas pelos rostos, escurecem os poemas
escurece o leite negro que bebemos e bebemos.","a posthumous song for paul celan
where you too will come sighing in the ditches, even if yours is a famished voice
and if i see your eyes at dawn, lost over the fields, in shuddering places — i will return — «i
even on the waves of midday, along the contour of a cherry, if i see you, margarete — i « darken — «and darken
as the hair of dark-coloured violins darkens me, as
the wind darkens in the cold woods where we die, the alleys darken
the black milk we drink and drink darkens.
whence you too will appear with the sublime finery of misfortune, even if your blood will curdle
and if in the evening, at the magic hour, i can glimpse your eyes reading galicia’s poems — i will return — «i
even on the trains digging a tunnel through the air, if i see you, sulamith — i «darken — «and i darken
as the evening darkens me in the smaller hours, as
lines darken on faces, poems darken
as darkens the black milk we drink and drink.",pt_XX,en_XX,"A posthume song for paul celan
Wherever you come to wake in the walls, not that your voice is fameful
And if your eyes see them in the morning, lost by the fields, in places that frighten — I come back — 'I
Even in the midday waves, in the calmline of the cherries, if I see you, margarette — I 'dark' — and I 'dark'
just like my hair with the dark tone of the flowers, just like myself, just like myself, just like myself, just like myself, just like myself, just like myself, just like myself, just like myself, just like myself, just like myself, just like myself, just like myself, just like myself, just like myself, just like myself, just like myself, just like myself, just like myself, just like myself, just like myself, just like myself, just like myself, just like myself, just like myself, just like myself, just like myself,
The wind has darkness in the cold groves in where we die, the laundries has darkness
The black bed that we drink and drink.
Wherever you come, together, for the sublime sleepness of unfortunity, not that your blood is
And if your lips see them by dusk, by magic time, reading the poems of the gallice — I'll come back — «me
Even in the trains that burrow a grave in the air, if I see you, sulamith — I ""shitch"" — and I ""shitch""
how the nightness in the sweetest hours darknessses me, how
The wrinkles have been dark by the faces, the poems have been dark
The black bed that we drink and drink."
"cabeça, tronco e membros
a camisa branca estendida na corda
do quintal é uma nuvem. há pouco,
quando a fui pendurar, ainda chovia.
agora, que o vento sopra forte dentro
dela, vejo de repente o teu tronco a
vesti-la. porém, se estendo os braços
para ele, só encontro o vazio. triste,
tento dizer-me que é apenas uma
camisa; mas, sem querer, volto
para casa com a nuvem na cabeça.","head, torso, and limbs
the white shirt hanging on the clothesline
in the backyard is a cloud. earlier,
when i went to hang it, it was still raining.
now, with the wind billowing inside
of it, i suddenly see your torso
underneath. but if i stretch my arms
toward it, all i find is emptiness. distressed,
i try to tell myself it’s only a
shirt; but, without meaning to, i go
back inside with the cloud in my head.",pt_XX,en_XX,"head, torn and torns
The white shirt on the leave
It's a cloud from the garden. It's a little time,
When I went up, it still rained.
Now, that the wind blows strongly inside

Know it. But if I walk my arms
For him, I just find the empty. Sad,
I'm trying to tell myself it's just one
T-shirt; but, unwantedly, I'll come back
Go home with the cloud in your head."
"carta ao pai
agora que o senhor
mais assemelha pedaço
de carne com dois olhos
dirigidos ao teto escuro
no leito em que provável
só não há-de morrer só
porque nem a própria
saliva poderá engolir
por si na companhia
somente desta sonda
que o alimenta
me pergunto se ainda
em validade a proibição
da mãe em confessar
ao senhor os hábitos
amorosos das mucosas
que são minhas
e se deveras me amaria
tanto menos soubesse
quanta fricção já tiveram
que não lhes cabia
biológica ou religiosa
-mente e se também
pediria para sua filhoa
a morte que desejou
a tantos de minha laia
quando surgiam na tela
da glboo da record
da manchete do sbt
que sempre constituíram
seu cordão umbilical
com a tradição
e se deveras faria
sobrevir a eles
grande destruição
pela violência
com que urrava
seus xingamentos
típicos de macho
nascido no interior
desse pais de machos
interiores e quebrados
em seus orgulhos falhos
de crer que o pai
é o que abarrota
geladeiras e não deixa
que falte à mesa
o alimento que nutre
as mesmas mucosas
em que corre
o seu sangre
mas não seu deus
e ora neste leito partido
o cérebro em veias
como riachos insistentes
em correr
fora das margens
se o senhor
soubesse o dolo
com que manchei
a mesa
de todos os patriarcas
ainda pergunto-me
se me receberia
com a mansidão
que aceita na testa
o beijo desta sua filhoa
que nada mais é
que a sua imagem
e semelhança invertidas
tal espelho
que refletisse opostos
de gênero e religião
ou o desenho
animado na infância
de uma sala de justiça
onde numa tela
podia-se observar
um mundo ao avesso
e se o pai e o pai
odeiam deveras
o gerado nas normas
da biologia e religião
mais tarde porém geridos
na transgressão das leis
que o pai e o pai
impõem-nos na ciência
de sermos todos falhos
nessa terra onde procriar
é tão frequente
que gere prazer
nenhum e olho
o senhor
com essas pupilas
que talvez jamais
reflitam o pai
mas ora veem o pai
eu
mesmo pedaço
de carne
com dois olhos
peço perdão
em silêncio
pois sequer posso
dizer que não
mais há tempo
e mesmo assim
e porém
e no entanto
e contudo
pelo medo adversativo
de talvez abalar
uma sistema rudimentar
de alicerces
sob a casa
sob o quarto
sob esta cama
de hospital
emprestada
escolho
uma vez mais
o silêncio","letter to the father
now that my lord
more closely resembles a hunk
of meat with two eyes
turned toward the dark ceiling
from the gurney where likely
you will not die alone
only because not even able
to swallow your saliva
yourself in the company
of this tube alone
that feeds you
i ask myself
if mother's ban
against confessing
to my lord the amorous habits
of my mucous membranes
is still in place
and if indeed you would love me
the less you knew about
how much rubbing they'd already had
that did not befit them
biological or religious
-ly and also if
you would want for your boyess
the death you wished
on so many of my kind
when they appeared on screen
on globo record
manchete or sbt
which always constituted
your umbilical connection
to tradition
and if indeed you would
make come upon them
great destruction
by the violence
of your raging slurs
typical of a macho man
born in a remote town
in this country of machos
remote and broken
in their false pride
believing that a father
is he who crams
refrigerators full and does
not let the table want for
food to nourish
the same mucous membranes
in which your blood
but not your god
runs thick
and now in this broken gurney
your brain all veins
like rivulets bent on
running
outside the lines
if my lord
knew how
i'd stained the patriarchs'
table with deceit
i still ask myself
if you would welcome
me as meekly
as you accept a kiss
on the forehead from
your boyess
who is nothing more
than your own image
and likeness inverted
a mirror such
as reflects opposites
of gender and religion
or the cartoon
from my childhood
of a hall of justice
where on a screen
you could watch a world gone wrong
and if the father and father
indeed scorn
one created by the norms
of biology and religion
yet later corrected
after flaunting the laws
the father and the father
impose on us in the science
of being all of us flawed
on this earth where procreating
is so common
it brings pleasure
not at all and i look at
my lord
with these pupils
that maybe never
reflect the father
but now see the father
i
also a hunk
of meat
with two eyes
ask forgiveness
in silence
for at least i can
say there is no more time
and nevertheless
and even still
and although
and yet
for conflicted fear
of possibly shaking
a rudimentary system
of foundation
holding up this house
holding up this room
holding up this borrowed
hospital
bed
i once again
choose
silence",pt_XX,en_XX,"it's a letter to my father
it's now when you
it's more similar to a piece
With a bit eyes
Tighten to the dark sky
in the bed in what probable
just can't die only
because not even the own
Saliva can get drowsy
it's for yourself in the company
it's only from this song

I'm asking if still
The ban is in force
from the mother to confess
to you the habits
Loved by mucosas
that are mine
And if you really would love me
it's so much I knowed
how many fritters have already had
it wouldn't fit them
Biologic or religious
-mind and if it too
You'd be asking for your children
The death that you desired
To so many of my laught
When they were sured on the scream
from record girlboo
It's from the sbt's head
that've always been the one
it's your umbilical cord
with tradition
And if I really would
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

Inner and broken
Into his fail pride

it's with the meek
it accepts on the head

"a viagem de alexandre à índia
andaste de um ao outro lado da terra na vida interminável,
tiveste degredos, piedosos cíumes, a fé desvanescida,
amantes paradas na lavoura, roubando-te o rosto amado.
viste vestígios de que foste a sombra de ninguém,
olhos sem pudor, do reflexo dos ferros no tropel,
franjas do domínio pueril de alexandre, olhando gaugamela.
partiste num porto de transição para o levante,
com vazios para trás, todo o tempo a poder ver,
e ao primeiro inverno, pelos cardeais das suas cinzas,
começaste a travessia que não termina, a história que não acaba.
soubeste porque se vislumbra, em lágrimas, o pinheiro da juventude,
o nome quebrado num turvo ar medido sem corda,
e a maresia do vento de feição no segundo inverno.
em troca perseguiste o que rege o homem fortuito,
segredando em palácios de mármore que são apenas pedras,
dos fracassos a que jamais alguém ajoelhara.
ao terceiro inverno descobriste o hemisfério, e ao quarto,
sem ideia de guerra ou ordem para mudar o reino,
escolheste adornar os aquedutos sob o manto dos regatos,
sentado, na brisa no tanque, ao febril entardecer.
de quem te aproximaste, no seu trajecto interminado,
sem lugar senão o que esfria na mente recortada,
naquilo que se ramifica, tornando-se na própria teia,
contigo propagou o dever de passar em toda a parte.
e quando veio o quinto inverno, e o sexto, suturaste o sangue,
trouxeste a pele à curva dos rios, acolheste o que de resto se desmorona,
e pudeste enfim, na crença dos migradores furtivos, entender que
tudo se perde noutro lugar ainda, e após esse ainda noutro
e que ao fim de cada manhã noutra manhã
tudo é incerto, tão conforme o dente-de-leão no meio de searas,
tão emudecido como a veia exausta dos não sepultados.
na mansarda onde vagueia o dia e a noite
o vento responde, cortando o centeio e o calcário, e a vela
que brilha na luz de estrelas veladas, já desaparecidas,
pisadas, mudas, engolidas aos pés do sétimo inverno,
arpoa o coração e a ruína — os meridianos despem-se, voam
em vinte e cinco anos que há pouco se beijavam, e seja dito ou não dito
o prazer que inflige um pico de tormentos
por lábios que só as mulheres conhecem
no moinho das águas da morte em varanasi,
sacode a chama de quanto vale, dura e canta
o princípio e o fim do teu poder na terra.","alexandres`s travel to india
you wandered an interminable life across the earth,
suffered exile, piteous jealousy, futile faith,
labour-arrested lovers plundering your beloved’s face.
you saw traces of having been no one’s shadow,
impudent eyes, the reflection of iron on the rampage,
hints of alexander’s puerile dominance, contemplating gaugamela.
you set off from a transient port towards the levant,
leaving emptiness behind, seeing all of time,
and in the first winter, by the cardinals of its ashes,
you started the endless crossing, the incessant history.
you knew, because the pine tree of youth can be glimpsed through tears,
of the shattered name in a cloudy mood measured without ropes,
and of the favourable sea breeze in the second winter.
in exchange you pursued that which rules the fortuitous man,
whispering in marble palaces that are but stones,
failures to which no one had ever knelt.
by the third winter you discovered the hemisphere, and by the fourth,
non intent on war or order to change the kingdom,
you chose to adorn aqueducts with the mantle of streams,
sitting by the pool breeze, in the evening´s lingering fever.
whomever you approached, in their indefinite path,
without a place except that which fades inside a patchy mind,
in that which branches out and becomes the very web,
has spread with you the duty to pass through everywhere.
and by the fifth winter, and the sixth, you stitched up the blood,
brought the skin on to the river bends, welcomed that which falls apart,
and were at last capable, with the belief of a stealthy migrant, of understanding
that all is lost yet in another place, and after this in yet another
and that by the end of each morning in another morning
all is uncertain, just like a dandelion in a field of wheat,
as muted as the exhausted vein of the unburied.
in the attic where night and day roam
the wind replies, cutting the chalk and the rye, and the candle,
shimmering in the light of the veiled stars already gone,
trodden, voiceless, swallowed up by the seventh winter,
spears the heart and the ruin — the meridians undress, fly away
in twenty five years that were just kissing yesterday, and be it told or untold
the pleasure that brings a peak of torment, inflicted
by lips that only women know
in the turmoil of varanasi´s death waters,
tests the flame of the merit, endurance and song of
the beginning and the end of your power on earth.",pt_XX,en_XX,"The trip of alonexande to India
You walk from one to one side of the earth in the interminable life,
You had degreases, pityful cities, famelessed faith,
lovers stop by the labours, smoking your loved face.
You've seen traces that you've been the shadow of no one,
Without eyes, from the reflex of the irons in the tropel,
Freaks of the chieril domain of alexandre, looking gaugamela.
You left in a port of transition to the return,
With empties back, all the time to be able to see,
And in the first winter, by the cardinals of their Ashes,
You start the traversy that doesn't end, the story that doesn't end.
You knowd because, in tears, the first of the youngry,
The name broken in a murky air measured without a three,
And the seasy of the wind of affection in the second winter.
You looked for what a fortuite man reigns,
Segreding in marbled palacios that are only rocks,
Of the fails that someone had never kneeled.
In the 3rd winter you discovered the hemisphere, and in the room,
Without idea of war or order to change the kingdom,
You chose to take the aqueducts which the dress of the waters,
Sit, in the bright in the box, in febrile dusk.
To those those those those those those those those those those those those those those those those those those those those those those those those were,
Without place but what colds in the corred mind,
Into thing that grows, turning into the own web,
With you prophesed the obligation to go by everything.
And when the five winter came, and the six, you sutured the blood,
You brought the skin to the currow of the rivers, you hold what else falls,
And you could finally, in the believe of the furtive migrants, understand that
Everything is lost in some place still, and after that still in some place
And that at the end of each morning in another morning
Everything is uncertain, as like the lion's teeth in the middle of nights,
It's as emudden as the exhausted vein of the unseemed.
At the mezzain, where the day walks and the night walks
the wind answers, slitting the rye and the calcarery, and the sail
That shines in the light of the same stars, already dissing,
foots, changes, swrapped by the feet of the 7th Winter,
Arporates the heart and the ruine — the meridians hurt, fly
In tweet and five years after they kissed, and be said or not said
The pleasure that imposes a picture of torture
By lips that only women know
In the mower of the waters of death, in veranasis,
Shake the flame of what worths, it takes and sings
The beginner and the end of your power on the earth."

i’m thinking of you, dear girl,
your mother’s memory haunts me.
my eyes fill up with tears,
they are bathing you gently.
you were born amid sorrow—
may it yet prove a blessing.
since fortune, struck with envy,
singled you out at birth.
gone forever was contentment,
you heard no joyful voices.
your mother’s life had ended,
while ours went on in sadness.
in anguish born and raised!
i don’t know where all this is going.
i’ve watched you grow, my girl,
with green eyes so lovely.
beauty like yours wasn’t meant
to be born in exile. curses on
fate! this was clearly a work
of malevolence, not a mistake.
here lies your mother,
and we languish in grief.
you did nothing, my girl,
to incur a loss so great.
the fates spurn reason,
and will admit no protest.
i pity your poor father,
for the pain he must lament.
i heard you crying, alone,
before anyone else. you’d not
be here, had i not been there.
still, i ask if i did right.
but surely it can’t be wrong
for you to have been born
with that elegant smile of yours,
those dazzling green eyes.
it’s an unlikely comfort
that i take for myself.
may god grant you the grace
that has eluded you till now.
beauty and good fortune,
or so the old story goes,
were once the best of friends,
but became bitterly opposed.
many hold that it’s fantasy,
but in my life i’ve seen
enough not to doubt it:
fate inflicts great damage.
no harm is ever believed;
we always expect the good.

lies an element of change,
an element of concern.",pt_XX,en_XX,"The girl and the girl

My eyes are fulled with water
I'm watering you in it:
You've been a daught, a daught, aren't you?
It's for a good, my girl, be to you
that in your name
Hears you the envy hardness:
It was dead, it was contentment.
No joy you've heard,
Your mother was fined,
In the others we are sad:
Nothing in pain in grow pain
I don't know where this will have
I see you beautiful girl
it's with the green eyes growing:
it wasn't this grace of yours
To be born in destroy
It's evil to disadventure
What had you put in this more than the mistake:
You had your grave here
your mother and hurl us
You're not your children, not
To die for you:
There was no reason in fadoes
Doesn't even let you ask?
it's your father's going too much
That of you is to be able to claim:
I heard you only
it's the first than anyone else
Don't you be his not out

the sharp and sudden pain
that stings me all of sudden,
appeared as a sudden flash,
of dazzling, dizzying white,
deranging what i saw,
costing me my vision,
causing all in view to flee,
in a gentle fading away.
it surrounded me
like a vast desert,
a vast, white desert,
vast and resplendent.

i do not feel, i do not think,
i hover, suspended in the light....
what endless pleasure!
in the flood of light
bathing every corner of sky,
in the ecstasy of light,
i watch an endless caravan.
poor naked bodies,
reduced in the distance,
reduced and diminished
in the depths of my pupils!
on the vast plain of sand
on the distant horizon
looms the unending caravan
of immense human suffering,
eminent human suffering,
useless human suffering —
advancing with bowed heads!
bowed to the ground,
bowed and exhausted,
bowed in a single file,
march their thin figures.
condemned slaves
outlined in the sunset,
outlines of black silhouettes:
thin, wretched and vile.
those who tremble out of fear
tremble at every blow,
and i feel my eyelids tremble
whenever the whip snaps.
crack! they only moan,
drawn and pale they moan,
moan with every crack
that knocks them down.
under the whip they fall,
with every stroke they fall,
rise back up, then fall,
still struggle up, in fear,
until at last they pass out,
finally they’ve passed out!
look at them, now fainted,
their pain now defeated…
may they lie there, peaceful,
on their backs and peaceful,
and may the light caress
their broad and peaceful brows,
o clear and calm skies,
sweet calm gardens,
where the suffering is less,
where souls can rest!

a vast, white desert,
vast and resplendent,
appeared as a sudden flash.

erupts in a tumult…

in savage conflict,
feral gleams in their eyes,

"nada existe que não tivesse começado.
mesmo na lonjura, decisiva porção iluminada,
em territórios despojados de todo o fim, em
areais de mares a desaguar desconhecidamente,
mais não olhamos senão a extensão do que vimos.
se campos da livónia vão dar a campos da mazúria,
se mosaicos amaciam na água de banhos mornos,
e além houver só cemitérios seguindo cemitérios, e
a meio deles, parado sem vento, o bosque de bétulas,
se o sol é o lume do azeite a esmiolar o pão
ou o clarão lascado nas muralhas de helsingør,
se o enredo da morte é igual em toda a parte,
seja na flauta de santa maria ou no gaiteiro de tallinn,
é porque modulamos num lugar o que lastrou de outro.
mesmo sem querer, ou sejam sombras afastando-se,
mais não tecemos que a linha de acasos e acertos
que uma corrente conduz, a cada um, em separado,
à passagem mais sensível do acabamento.
mesmo isolando os lugares numa função laboriosa,
detalhando as suas divergências, e as pontas extremas
— a parecença entre o que são e o que pensámos serem,
mesmo nas regiões cruzadas por comboios extensos,
onde a noite cairá em escamas de lavanda,
seguiremos a mesma história — afundamos os pés no mesmo solo.
naquilo por que vamos repetidamente levados,
ansiando o que se manifeste acolá na próxima enseada,
alisando com a mão os castanheiros onde inscrevemos, depois
de outros, nossos sinuosos nomes, nossos amores,
sempre tornamos ao ponto em que tudo se repete e inicia,
de que atingimos apenas um minuto só — um instante,
a lâmina que medeia o ano que passa e o ano que vem.","nothing exists that hasn’t had a beginning.
nothing exists that hasn’t had a beginning.
even in the distance, a clear lit speck,
in territories stripped from all limits, on
sands that flow from unknown seas,
we only contemplate the extent of what we perceived.
if fields in livonia lead to fields in masuria,
if tiles are smoothed in tepid bath waters,
and further on graveyard follows graveyard, and
in their midst, inert in the lack of wind, the birch wood stands,
if the sun is the flame of the olive oil crumbling the bread
or the chipped lightening on the walls of helsingør,
if the death plot is everywhere the same,
be it in the santa maria flute or in the tallinn concertina
it is because we modulate in one place what has seeped from another.
even unwillingly, or perhaps it’s the shadows on the move,
we weave no more than a row of chances and discretions
along a current which takes each one of us, separately,
to the most sensitive final passage.
even if laboriously we detach the places,
detailing their diversions and extremes
— the similarity between what they are and what we thought they were,
even throughout regions intersected by extensive trains,
where night will fall in scales of lavender,
we’ll follow the same story — we sink our feet in the same mud.
in that which repeatedly sucks us in,
as we yearn for whatever comes to pass further in the next cove
smoothing with our hands the oak trees on whose bark we inscribe,
like others before us, our sinuous names, our loves,
we constantly return to the point where all is repeated and begun,
of which we grasp a mere minute — an instant,
the blade mediating between this year and the next.",pt_XX,en_XX,"There are nothing that hadn't begin.
it's even in the lunjura, a decisional lighted lotion,
in territorys despoiled from all the end, in
The airs of the seas unwatering unknowly,
We don't look anymore but the expanse of what we've seen.
If livery fields will give the mazúria fields,
If the moosaics grazed in the water of honey baths,
And beyond there are only cemiteries following cemiteries, and
in the middle of them, standed without a wind, the beetwood,
If the sun is the light of the oil smiling the bread

even isoling the places in a laborful work,
Detaking his differences, and the far tips
The resemblance of what it is and what we thought to be,
even in the regions crossed by long trains,
Where the night will fall in laundry squames,
We'll follow the same story — down the feet on the same ground.
In that why we're going to take it again,
Looking for what is manifested here in the next cove,
With the hand of the darkmen where we enscribe, then
Of others, our single names, our loves,
We've always come back to the point where everything remains and starts,
that we get just a minute only — a moment,
The lamina that mederates the past year and the past year."

na sombra das folhas de nossos passos
sob um manto de nuvens o dia escureceu; o outono
gerou e apagou novas e efémeras
constelações, e à janela, olhando os cumes nevados ao
longe envoltos no orvalho de um doce sofrimento,
nossos olhos envelheceram; as nossas lembranças e aqueles
que amámos teceram palavras esquecidas; e a vida,
seguindo e caindo sem fim, pareceu apagar-se
como espuma numa recordação fugaz, um bloco de gelo,
transparente, esculpindo e transformando os aspectos do tempo ou
que os gansos agarravam com as asas as frágeis
penas do seu ser, as faziam estilhaçar.
mas era justamente por os anos passados pesarem
sobre nós, voltarem, ou desaparerem, que as terras e os
vales se sentia que suspiravam, que marcavam grãos de areia
no rosto, como outrora em connemara; que se sentia que a natureza
estava prestes a transformar-se, que a nossa sombra estava
prestes a desaparecer; que a neve caía, ia caindo, a neve dos teixos
deixando passar a neve; e que o inverno chegava com
as suas raízes escoradas pela água, e que a ronda do ano
dava outra volta fortuita na charneca, outra volta
na primavera e no verão; outro sopro do seu espírito, como um
gerânio que as pétalas desenham num curso incessante, invisível, e caíssem
na cratera da inocência, dos que vivem, dos que morrem.","circular time
in the leafed shadows of our footsteps
under a mantle of cloud, the day darkened; autumn
crafted and wiped out new and ephemeral
constellations, and by the window, reaching out to distant
snow dusted peaks robed in sweet suffering dew,
our eyes grew old; our memories and those
we loved weaved a forgotten word; and life,
ever returning, and ever falling, seemed to vanish
like foam or a brief remembrance, an ice block,
transparent, shaping and changing the faces of time, or
like a shattering of fragile wings, were the geese
to try and grab it in full flight.
but it was precisely because the passing of the years
weighing on us was coming back or disappearing, that the lands and
the valleys were heard sighing, were allowed to leave the grains of sand
on their face, like long ago in connemara; nature
seemed to be about to transform, our shadow was
about to disappear; the snow was falling, kept falling, the yew snow
letting the snow through; and winter arrived with
its roots dipped in water, and the turn of the year

"morticínio ancestral
quando minha avó torcia o pescoço
dos frangos, não raras vezes
chegando a decapitá-los,
e os lançava ao chão frio de cimento
para aquela dança assustadora,
não havia em seu rosto
paixão, prazer, ou pena.
na escuridão escondida dentro do meio-dia,
aqueles morticínios eram os atos
mais honestos na violência
daquela casa e daquela infância.
afogando na água fervente
os cadáveres sem cabeça
[que ficara de banda no quintal
interrogando seu criador],
ela passava a depená-los, ágil,
qual fosse ela um gavião-pedrês.
como o cafuné do crânio da onça
no crânio da capivara,
ou o abraço anelar das garras do carcará
ao redor do corpo todo-torso da cobra,
nada naquela velha
era cogitado
para além da missão simples:
alimentar a prole.
como todo animal que não questiona
a cadeia alimentar diante da fome,
minha avó foi o bicho mais inocente
da minha casa e da minha selva.
mais do que os gatos e pombos,
mais do que os jabutis e coelhos,
com certeza
era mais inocente minha avó
do que as cachorras da casa,
aquelas cachorras grandes e gordas

esperando também daquela mamífera-anciã
que manchasse ela as mãos de sangue.","ancestral slaughter
when my grandmother used to wring
the necks of chickens, not infrequently
to the point of decapitation,
and dropped them to the cold cement floor
and that shocking dance,
on her face there was no trace
of passion, pleasure, or pity.
in the darkness hidden within the noonday,
those killings were the most honest acts
in the violence of that house,
that childhood.
after plunging into boiling water
those headless corpses
[who’d stood in brood in the yard
questioning their creator],
she began to pluck them, with all
the agility of a gray-lined hawk.
like the caress of the jaguar’s skull
on the capybara’s, or the annulate
embrace of the caracara’s claws
on a snake’s all-torso body,
nothing in that old woman
was cognized
beyond a simple mission:
to feed her offspring.
as any animal does not question
the food chain in the face of hunger,
my grandmother was of all animals
the most innocent in my house
and in my forest.
more than cats and pigeons,
more than tortoises and rabbits,
this is far more certain:
my grandmother was more innocent
even than our household dogs,
our big, fat dogs
with sharp — but useless — teeth,

"écloga segunda
dizem que havia um pastor
antre tejo e odiana,
que era perdido de amor
por uma moça joana:
joana patas guardava
pela ribeira do tejo
seu pai acerca morava
e o pastor, de alentejo
era: e jano se chamava
quando as fomes grandes foram
que alentejo foi perdido
da aldeã que chamam torrão
foi este pastor fogido:
levava um pouco de gado
que lhe ficou de outro muito
que lhe morreu de cansado
que alentejo era enxuto
d’água, e mui seco de prado
toda a terra foi perdida
no campo do tejo só
achava o gado guarida
ver alentejo era um dó:
e jano, pera salvar
o gado que lhe ficou,
foi esta terra buscar,
e um cuidado levou,
outro foi ele lá achar
o dia que ali chegou
com seu gado e com seu fato
com tudo se agasalhou
em uma bicada de um mato:
e levando-o a pascer
o outro dia à ribeira
joana acertou de ir ver,
que andava pela ribeira
do tejo: a flores colher
vestido branco trazia
um pouco afrontada andava
fermosa bem parecia
aos olhos de quem na olhava:
jano em vendo-a foi pasmado
mas por ver que ela fazia
escondeu-se antre um prado:
joana flores colhia
jano colhia cuidado
despois que ela teve as flores
já colhidas e escolhidas,
as desvariadas cores
com rosas entremetidas:
fez delas uma capela
e soltou os seus cabelos
que eram tão longos como ela
e de cada um a jano em vê-los
lhe nascia uma querela
e em quanto aquisto fazia
joana: o seu gado andava
por dentro da água fria
todo após quem o guiava:
dum pato grande era guia
e todo junto em carreira
ora rio acima ia,
ora, na mesma maneira
o rio abaixo descia
joana como assentou
a capela: foi com a mão
à cabeça, e atentou
se estava em boa feição:
não ficando satisfeita
do que da mão presumia
partiu-se dali direita
para onde o rio fazia
d’água: uma mansa, colheita
chegando à beira do rio,
as patas logo vieram
todas uma e uma, em fio,
que toda a água moveram:
de quanto ela já folgou
com aquestes gasalhados
tanto entonces lhe pesou
e com pedras e com brados
d’ali longe as enxotou
depois que elas foram idas
e que a água assossegou
joana as abas erguidas
entrar pel’água ordenou,
e assentando-se então
as çapatas descalçou
e pondo-as sobre o chão
por dentro d’água entrou
e a jano polo coração
em quanto com passos quedos
joana pela água ia
antre uns desejos e medos
jano onde estava ardia:
não sabia se falasse
se saísse, se estivesse
que o amor mandava que ousasse
e por que a não perdesse
fazia que arreceasse
dizem que naqueste meo
se esteve joana olhando
e descobrindo o seu seo
olhou-se, e dixe um ai dando:
eu guardo patas coitada
não sei onde isto há de ir ter
mais era eu pera guardada
que concerto foi este ser
fermosa, e mal empregada
em aquisto jano ouvindo
não se pôde em si sofrer
que d’antre as ervas saindo
se não lançasse a correr:
joana quando sentiu
os estrompidos de jano
e que se virou e o viu
temor do presente dano
lhe deu pés com que fugiu
mui perto estava o casal
onde vivia o pai dela
que fez ir mais longe o mal
que jano teve de vê-la:
mas o medo que causou
joana partir-se assi
tanto as mãos lhe embaraçou
que a çapata esquerda ali
com a pressa lhe ficou
jano quando viu, e olhou
que nenhum remédio havia
pera o lugar se tornou
aonde ela n’água se via:
e vendo a çapata estar
no areal, à beira d’água
foi correndo a abraçar
tomando-a cresceu-lhe a mágoa
e começou de chorar
toda a çapata e os peitos
em lagrimas se banharam
muitos foram os respeitos
que tanto choro causaram:
encostado ao seu cajado
a çapata na outra mão
despois de um longo cuidado
de dentro do coração
começou falar cansado
jano
despojo da mais fermosa
cousa, que viram meus olhos
pera eles sois uma rosa
e pera o coração abrolhos:
çapata deixada aqui
pera mal de outro mor mal
quem te leixou, leva a mi,:
que troca tão desigual
mais pois assi é seja assim
agora hei vinte e um anos
e nunca inda ‘té agora
me acorda de sentir danos
os deste meu gado em fora:
e hoje per caso estranho
não sei em que hora aqui vim
cobrei cuidado tamanho,
que aos outros todos pôs fim
eu mesmo a mim mesmo estranho
antes que este mal viesse
que me tantos vai mostrando
que alguns cuidados tivesse
não me matavam cuidando,
agora por meus pecados
e segundo em mi vou vendo
não podem ser outros fados
meus cuidados não entendo
e moiro-me assi de cuidados
dentro de meu pensamento
há tanta contrariedade
que sento contra o que sento
vontade, e contra vontade:
estou em tanto desvairo,
que não me entendo comigo
donde esperarei repairo
que vejo grande o perigo
e muito mor o contrario
quem me trouxe a esta terra
alhea, onde guardada
me estava tamanha guerra
e a esperança levada:
comigo me estou espantado
como em tão pouco me dei
mas cuidando nisto estando,
os olhos com que outrem olhei
de mim, se estavam vingando
e por meu mal ser mor: inda
de mim tenho o agravo mor
que da minha mágoa infinda
eu fui parte e causador,
que se me não alevantara
d’antre as ervas onde estava
mais dos meus olhos gozara
e já que assi se ordenava
isto ao menos me ficara
desastres cuidava eu já,
quando eu ontem aqui cheguei
que a vós e á ventura má,
ambos acabava e errei:
triste que me parecia
que o meu gado remediado
comigo bem me haveria
e estava-me ordenado
est’outro mal que inda havia
o mal, não vos sabe a vós
quem me vos a mim causou
tristes dos meus olhos sós
que trouveram aonde estou:
olhos: acerto, lugar
ribeira mor das ribeiras
que levam as águas ao mar
vós me sereis verdadeiras
testemunhas do pesar
autor
e em dizendo isto parece
trasportou-se no seu mal
e como a quem o ar falece
caiu naquele areal:
grande espaço se passou
que esteve ali sem sentido
e neste meo chegou
um pastor seu conhecido
e que dormia cuidou
franco de sandovir era
o seu nome, e buscava
uma frauta que perdera
que ele mais que a si amava:
este era aquele pastor
a quem celia muito amou
ninfa do maior primor
que em mondego se banhou
e que cantava milhor
e a frauta sua era aquela
que lhe celia dera, quando
o desterraram por ela,
chorando ele, ela chorando:
viera ele ali mora
porque achou aquelas terras
mais conformes ao cuidar
d’ambas partes cercam serras,
no meu campos para olhar
doutro tempo conhecidos
estes dous pastores eram
d’estranhas terras nascidos,
não no bem que se quiseram;
e por aquesta razão
tornou franco a lhe notar
como jazia no chão
e deu-lhe que suspeitar
o lugar e a feição
muito esteve duvidando
o que aqui franco faria
indo-se e jano deixando
o coração lhe doía:
também pera o acordar
não sabia se acertava
que jano era no lugar
novo, e arreceava
em cabo de o anojar
naquesta dúvida estando
jano estava emborcado
dixe um suspiro dando
ai cuidado, e mais cuidado:
ouvindo-lhe isto dizer
franco se ficou pasmado
e tornando-o milhor ver
de sob seu esquerdo lado
viu-lh’a çapata ter
suspeitou logo o que era,
(que era também namorado)
e no que jano dixera
se houve por certificado
naquisto jano acordou
quando viu franco estar
sem fala um pouco ficou
franco, após o saudar
falar-lhe assi começou
franco cuidava eu agora jano
que estavas em outra parte
e polo teu, aqueste ano
me pesava ir por esta arte:
dessejava ver-te aqui
quando me contava alguém
a seca grande que hai
em alentejo, e porém
não quisera eu ver-te assi
conta-me que mal foi este
que tão demudado estás
ou que houveste ou perdeste
se há remédio havê-lo-ás:
faz jano então por se erguer
não podendo de cansado
foi-lhe a mão, franco, estender
e a um freixo encostado
lhe começou responder
jano
vim a estes campos que vejo
por dar vida a este meu gado
vi acabado um desejo,
outro maior começado:
às minhas vacas dei vida
e a mim a fui tirar
a profecia é cumprida
que me pierio foi dar
vendo-me a barba pungida

de pierio vai grã fama
(dixe franco) antre os pastores
todos por amigos chama
e dizem que é dado a amores,
rogo-te jano me digas
pois te ele avisou primeiro
como cobraste fadigas
que ouço que é mui verdadeiro
pera amigos e amigas
jano
tão cansado, respondeu
de um cuidado, franco, me acho
que m’agora aqui nasceu
que até na voz tenho empacho,
aos que hão de aquecer
não pode homem resistir
que o há de ser, há de ser
não se lhe pode fugir,
defender, nem esconder
mas por que franco, contigo
desabafo eu em falar
por que sei que és meu amigo
tudo te quero contar:
nem remédio nem conforto
não te hei franco de pedir
que do mal em que estou posto
não me espero de remir
senão despois que for morto
dia era de um grão vodo
que a um santo se fazia
onde ia o povo todo
por ver e por romaria,
lembra-me que andava eu então
vestido todo de novo
ao ombro um chapeirão
que pasmava todo o povo
com um cajado na mão
tomando-me pelo braço
pierio, então me levou
d’ali um grande pedaço
onde milhor sombra achou:
e mandando-me assentar
ele também se assentou
e antes de começar
pera mim um pouco olhou
e a voltas de chorar
pierio
vejo-te (me dixe) jano,
dos bens do mundo abastado
mas contando ano e ano
fico de todo cortado:
vejo-te lá pela idade
de nuve negra cercado
vejo-te sem liberdade
de tua terra desterrado
e mais de tua vontade
em terra que inda não viste,
pelo que nela hás de ver,
vejo-te o coração triste
pera em dias que viver,
hás de morrer de uma dor
de que agora andas bem fora
por isso vive em temor
que não sabe homem aquela hora
em que lhe há de vir o amor
não pode já longe vir
jano aquisto que te digo
vejo-te a barba pungir
olha como andas contigo:
à terra estranha irás
por teu gado não perderes
longos males passarás
por uns mui breves prazeres
que verás ou não verás
(e dando um pouco á cabeça,
á maneira d’anojado)
por teu bem porém te cresça
a barba (dixe) de honrado:
treslada-o no coração
isto que te aqui direi
que ainda que te aqui direi
que ainda alguns tempos virão
jano, que te alembrarei
mande deus que seja em vão
por cobrares a fazenda
a ti mesmo perderás
perda que não tem emenda
despois quando o saberás:
nos campos de uma ribeira
onde vales há a lugares
te está guardada a primeira
causa destes teus pesares
noutra parte a derradeira
jeitos em cousas pequenas
louros cabelos ondados
porão pera sempre em penas
a ti e a teus cuidados:
falas cheas de desdém
de presunção cheas delas
cousas que outras cousas têm
te causarão as querelas
de que morrer te convém
de todo o que te hei contado
todo casi aconteceu

between the rivers tagus
and guadiana, there lived,
it’s said, a shepherd lost
in love for one joana.
the maiden kept ducks
along the tagus’s banks,
her father’s house nearby.
the shepherd’s name was jano,
he hailed from alentejo.
when famine swept the land,
laying it all to waste,
the shepherd, seeking refuge,
fled torrão, his village.
he took with him the remnants
of his once-great flock,
the rest dead of exhaustion.
the drought-struck alentejo
was rather poor in pasture.
everywhere was the piteous
sight of barren fields!
only in the tagus’s
meadows could his flock
find relief. and so jano,
to save his dwindling herd,
set out for land to graze on.
the heart he held was troubled,
and trouble was waiting ahead.
the day that he arrived
with goats and sheep in tow,
he pitched camp at the edge
of a wood. the next morning,
while taking his flock to feed
along the river’s margins,
he laid eyes on joana,
out picking the flowers
that lined the tagus’s banks.
the dress she wore was white,
her cheeks were lightly flushed,
to jano, his eyes agog,
she looked fair and lovely.
though smitten at first sight,
he crouched behind the reeds,
admiring her from a distance.
joana gathered flowers,
in jano passion gathered.
after she had collected
her flowers and selected
the various shades, weaving
the blossoms together with roses,
she made a garland, and let
her hair fall: those tresses
were as long as she was tall.
every lock of her hair
was awakening jano’s desire.
as joana tidied her hair,
her flock of hens waddled
into the cool water,
guided by a huge mallard.
they swam, now upriver,
all in one direction,
now swiftly swam downstream,
together in single file.
joana placed the garland
on her head, stroking it
with her hands to see if
all sat perfectly in place.
not quite satisfied
with what her fingers revealed,
straight away she went
to where the river formed
a cove of placid water.
no sooner had she reached
the bank than her ducks came
flocking towards her, one after
the other, splashing wildly.
initially she’d delighted
in these shows of affection,
quickly her heart grew heavy.
flinging rocks and jeers,
she shooed the ducks away.
once they were all gone,
and the water calm again,
joana tucked her skirt up,
preparing for a swim.
she sat upon the bank,
carefully removing her slippers,
placing each on the ground.
then into the water she went,
and deep into jano’s heart.
as joana took delicate
steps into the river,
jano kept utterly still,
ablaze with desire and fear.
whether to speak, run,
stay put — he didn’t know.
love demanded boldness,
and yet the very thought of
losing her stirred up dread.
all this time joana
stood gazing at her reflection.
staring at her bosom,
she gave a sigh and said:
“what torment! a keeper
of ducks, i should be kept.
where is my life going?
what cruel sense of harmony:
to be fair and drudging away!
hearing these words jano
couldn’t contain himself.
having no other choice,
he burst out the grassy bank.
joana, feeling the thunderous
crash of jano’s footsteps,
turned and saw his face.
sensing the danger at hand,
she swiftly ran toward home.
the house where her father lived
was near, which plunged jano
further into the despair
born of their encounter.
the same fear that had urged
joana’s feet forward
also completely seized
her hands — and in her haste
she grabbed only one slipper.
looking around jano
saw there was no remedy,
turning his gaze to where
joana had studied her image.
when he spotted her slipper
on top the pebbly shore,
he raced over to retrieve it.
squeezing it in his arms,
he felt his sorrow grow,
and began to weep, bathing
his chest and the slipper in tears.
many were the reasons
for his anguished weeping.
leaning against his staff,
holding the slipper tightly,
jano paused for a moment
then he spoke from the heart,
exhausted and teary-eyed.
jano
“o remnant of the fairest
thing that i’ve ever seen,
to my eyes you are a rose,
and to my heart, thistles.
slipper cruelly forgotten,
remembering cruel passion,
who left you sweeps me away—
what an unfair exchange!
alas, that’s the way it must be.
“in my twenty-one years
i can’t remember feeling
even a pang of sorrow,
my flock’s troubles aside.
today, by some strange fate,
— i don’t know when exactly—,
i was racked by a yearning
that eclipsed my other cares,
becoming estranged myself.
“before this present sorrow,
which only multiplies,
although i had my cares,
the caring didn’t kill me.
but now it’s far too late,
i sense the change within,
my fate’s already sealed.
i do not grasp my anguish,
and languish of this passion.
“all i think is riddled
with glaring contradictions:
i oppose what i desire,
while desiring the opposite.
what i feel is so muddled,
i’m at odds with myself.
where might i look for relief?
i know the danger is grave—
graver is my confusion.
“who brought me to this strange
land, where an all-out war
awaited me and where i had
my hope taken away?
i scarcely can believe it:
here i am, reduced
to tears, passion’s slave.
the eyes with which i glimpsed
my beloved are taking revenge.
“my sorrow is greater still:
i brought this all on myself,
culprit and victim of infinite
suffering. had i only
stayed hidden in the reeds,
i would have feasted my eyes
on her beauty, and then —
since it has to be this way —,
at least i’d have my memory.
“disaster upon disaster!
yesterday i came here,
thinking my troubles gone.
oh how i was mistaken!
though i’d begun to hope
that, with my flock restored,
some good might come my way,
sadly, fortune willed
that i should suffer on.
“accursed love! who made me
love's prisoner knows none.
my sad, lonely eyes,
having met her gaze
on the banks of this river
that stretches unto infinity,
carrying water to sea:
you’ll be the faithful witnesses
to all my weighty sorrows.
author
having said these words,
transported by his passion,
jano fell on the sand,
like a man starved of air.
after some time had gone by,
jano still lying senseless,
a shepherd he used to know
passed by, noting the man
fast asleep on the ground.
franco of sandovir
was his name—searching
for a flute he had lost
but loved better than life,
this shepherd was adored
by none less than celia,
that finest of nymphs who bathed
in the mondego’s waters,
hers the sweetest of voices.
she gave the flute to franco
when he was leaving for exile
—imposed on him for his love—,
he weeping as she wept.
he had come here to live,
finding the landscape appropriate
for his aching heart:
rugged hills on all sides,
open fields to gaze on.
born to very little
in villages far apart,
these two shepherds had been
friends in bygone days.
for this reason franco
turned to take another
look at the man lying
on the ground, sensing
that something was amiss.
franco struggled greatly
deciding what to do—
were he to leave jano
behind, his heart would ache.
nor did he think it wise
to rouse his friend awake.
with jano being asleep
in an unfamiliar place,
he feared that he might startle.
franco wrestling with doubt,
jano turned on his back.
heaving a sigh, he said,
“all i do is suffer!”
when he heard these words,
franco turned around
in astonishment, noticing
the slipper tucked gingerly
beneath jano’s left arm.
he suspected what it was,
for he too was in love.
in jano’s bitter words
he’d all the proof he needed.
jano, now fully alert,
realizing it was franco,
stared in bewildered silence.
franco greeted him warmly
and with these words began:
franco
“why jano, i had thought
you lived in other parts.
i feared, for you and your flock,
the year might go this way.
when i caught word of the drought
now sweeping alentejo,
i hoped i’d see you here,
though certainly not in this state.
“tell me what harm’s been done
that you should be so changed?
what trouble found? thing lost?
if there’s a cure, you’ll have it.”
when jano, still quite weak,
tried to get up but stumbled,
franco held out his hand.
leaning against the trunk
of an ash tree jano said:
jano
“i came to the fields before me
to give life to my flock.
i slaked one desire only
to know greater thirst.
to my cattle i gave life,
having taken my own!
the prophecy’s been fulfilled,
as revealed by pierio,
when my first beard came in.
author
“among shepherds,” said franco,
“his reputation precedes him.
he considers all his friends;
he’s given, they say, to affairs.
now, jano, tell me this,
if he warned you in advance,
why this present hardship?
i hear he’s an honest friend
to men and women both.”
jano
“franco, i’ve grown so weary,
of the sorrow i’ve found
since coming to this place,
i can feel the strain in my voice.
whatever fortune brings,
a man can’t resist his fate,
what will be, will be—
there’s no escaping it, no point
fighting it, no hiding away.
“but with you, dear franco,
i can freely vent my pain.
knowing you to be a friend,
i wish to tell you everything.
i don’t ask that you provide
comfort or remedy, franco.
fr i can’t hope to be saved
from the trouble i’m in,
at least not till i die.
“it was a saint’s day feast:
all the people huddled
together, pilgrims come
from far and wide to see.
that day i remember dressing
in all new clothes, draped on
my shoulder was a woolen
hood coveted by the crowd.
in my hand i held my staff.
“taking me by the arm,
pierio led me some distance,
to a well-shaded grove.
telling me to take a seat
and sitting down next to me,
he paused and stared a while,
not saying a word, looking
on the verge of tears.
pierio
“jano,” he said, “i see
you don’t lack for worldly goods.
but with each passing year
my outlook grows more grim.
i see a black cloud looming.
now that you’re of age,
i see you stripped of freedom,
in exile far from home,
still farther from your will.
“in a land you’ve yet to see,
you’ll catch sight of something
that fills your heart with sorrow
for the rest of your days.
you’ll die of an affliction
that’s now just a distant threat.
live, therefore, in fear,
for no man knows the hour
when love will choose to strike.
“jano, the things i’ve said
can’t be very far away:
i see the down on your lip;
look at how you’re acting.
you’ll travel to a strange land
so as not to lose your flock,
enduring bitter hardships
for the briefest of pleasures,
so you’ll see, should you choose.”
pierio shook his head,
a stern look on his face.
“now, for your own sake,
act with manly honor,
and etch onto your heart
the words i’m about to say.
some hard days lie ahead,
jano, i must remind you.
may god prove me wrong!”
“in trying to save your flock,
you’ll become lost to yourself—
a loss that’s beyond repair
by the time it registers.
in the fields by the river,
among valleys, there lurks
your suffering’s first cause.
elsewhere you’ll meet your demise:
“her dainty mannerisms,
her wavy blonde hair
will subject your heart and mind
to never-ending punishment.
words laced with disdain,
words uttered in scorn,
a vast array of injuries —
it’ll all make you complain
so bitterly, you’d rather die.”
jano
“nearly all that i’ve said
happened as predicted.
what’s not yet come to pass,
the past has set in motion.
just a short while ago,
i caught sight of a lady
my eyes keep searching for.
my life and soul, she’s gone,
having deemed me unworthy.”
author
while jano spoke, a bloodhound
belonging to franco found
the missing flute, clutching it
with its teeth. when he saw,
bursting with joy, franco
ran to retrieve the flute.
standing on its hind legs,
the dog placed it in his hands,
proceeding to roll on its back.
franco turned to jano,
then he said these words:
“when he sees what he’s pined for,
a man forgets all else.
i cut your story short—
for that you’ll have to blame
whom i can’t, or forgive me
yourself, jano. you know
what it means to be in love.”
“that flute must be dear to you
as few things are,” said jano.
“indeed, nothing’s dearer,”
franco said in response.
“whoever gave you that
must have you in her debt,”
jano said to franco,
“truly you must play well ,
unless the dog got it wrong.”
“sing something, franco,
sadness loves a song!
let us see if your music
can’t soothe my bitter sorrow.”
“of course,” franco said,
“i will sing for you, jano,
as one sings for an ailing man.
although truth be told,
my song is but a wail.”
“i would like for you to hear
the song i sang last night,
after i had lost my flute,
left with only my voice.
when at last i went to bed,
i wasn’t tired of searching,
but weary of finding nothing.
now, jano, i mean it,
i couldn’t shut my eyes.”
“there, in the deep of night,
when all was utterly still,
i belted out my song,
an owl kept me company.
from his faraway perch,
—perhaps i only imagined it—
the owl would respond with sighs
as heavy as my own.
at any rate, here goes.”
song
wandering in exile i ask:
what to do, where to go?
after the deepest despair,
i’ve found the greatest sorrow.
the anguish! i’m a roving
stranger in remote lands,
to which i came in search
of refuge for my flock!
i, to whom cruel fortune
affords no consolation,
fear that, being ill-fated,
i will one day be made
to die by my own hand.
how to explain myself
to one not here to ask me?
how to beg forgiveness
of one who cannot hear me?
o gift of my beloved,
whose absence shrouds the night,
my flute, lost forever!
make a grave and bury me:
i perished long ago…
and upon my tombstone,
let these words be written:
in her heart lies my soul.
if on a distant day
in years to come, celia,
wherever she may be,
having heard the smallest
portion of all i suffered,
were to fall to pieces,
unable to hold back tears—
then would my soul be sated,
or whatever remains of me.
though i ask for nothing,
since i suffer so greatly,
let my eyes drift in reverie.
day after day slips by.
these lonely nights were made
for anguished spirits like ours.
“that’s the song, dear jano,
i believed it was my last;
i confess i hoped it’d mark
the end of all my suffering.
if mind and soul don’t perish
with the body, my sorrow
will remain. let us go,
it’s time the flock grazed,
torment too has its season.”",pt_XX,en_XX,"It's a second spot.

In a bitch of a grove:
And taking it to pass
The other day on the river
Joana's right to go and see,
that walked through the river
from the tejo: the flowers to see
It was a white white dress
It was a little affronted
She looked so much, she looked so much, she looked so much, she looked so much, she looked so much, she looked so much, she looked so much, she looked so much, she looked so much, she looked so much, she looked so much, she looked so much, she looked so much, she looked so much, she looked so much, she looked so much, she looked so much, she looked so much, she looked so much, she looked so much, she looked so much, she looked so much, she looked so much, she look
In the eyes of the one who looked in the eyes:
Jiano seeing her was bewisted
But to see what she would do
It's hide between a ground:
Joana flowers collie

Then she had the flowers
It's already collected and choose,
the different colors
With roses intertwined:
it made them a chapella
And left your hair
that were as long as she
And everyone is jano in seeing them
It was born to you a dear
And what I've been able to do
Joana: your herd walked
Inside the cold water
All after those who guided him:

And everything together in a career

The river was going down
- Joana, how you've been
the chapella: it was with my hand
to the head, and he looked
If it was in good affection:
Don't be content
What of the hand supposed
it left from the right way
Where the river went
Water: a meek, cold
Arriving by the river,
The pets came soon
it's all one and one, it's all one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one
that all the water moved:
how much she's already left
it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it
So much, then weighed you
And with rocks and with screams
It's been far away from them.
It's beforget them to go
And that the water came up
it's joana, it's the wings up
Come in by the water,
it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it
It's not going undressed.
And put them on the ground
it's inside the water, it's in
And the jano for the heart
As long as the steps are steps
Oh, joana by the water was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was
between desires and fears
Jiano where it was burning:
I didn't know if you'd talk
If it goes out, if it goes out
that love would tell you dare
And why wouldn't lose it
it would make me crazy
They say that in this mine
If joana was looking

If it wouldn't run:
Joana when you felt
The broken of jano
And that turned and saw it
Afraid of the gift happiness
He gave him feet he ran away
The couple was so close
Where her father was lived
That made to go further the evil
That jano had to see her:
But the fear that caused
Joana goes up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up
You've been so embarrassed by your hands
that's the left path that's
You've been in a hurt
Jano when he saw, and looked
that there was no medicament
""Pear the place has turned
Where she in the water was seen:
it's seeing that piety been
it's in the air, by the waterside
it was running to hug
Take it up, it grows up, it hurts up, it hurts up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, up, it's up, up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's it's up, it's up, it's up, it's it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, it's up, up, it's up, it's up, up, it's up, up, it's up, it's up, up, it's

from inside the heart
It's begin to talk tired

Remember me from feeling dirty
Them were my herds out:
And it's now by eerie chance
I don't know what time I came here
I've covered care of the size,
that to the others everyone end
it's myself, it's myself, it's myself, it's myself, it's myself, it's myself, it's myself, it's myself, it's myself, it's myself, it's myself, it's myself, it's myself, it's myself, it's myself, it's myself, it's myself, it's myself, it's myself, it's myself, it's myself, it's myself, it's myself, it's myself, it's myself, it's myself, it's myself, it's myself, it's myself, it's myself, it's myself, it's myself, it's myself, it's myself, it's myself,
just before this evil was come
What so many of you're showing me
that some care would have
They wouldn't kill me careling,
Now for my sins
And second in me I'll see
Can't be other fadoes
I don't understand my care
And I move myself care
Inside my thought
There are so much adversity
That I feel after what I feel after what I feel after what I feel after what I feel after what I feel after what I feel after what I feel after what I feel after what I feel after what I feel after what I feel after what I feel after what I feel after what I feel after what I feel after what I feel after what I feel after what I feel after what I feel after what I feel after what I feel after what I feel after what I feel after what I feel after what I feel after what I feel after what I feel after what I feel after what
Will, and unfailingly:
I'm in so much mistake,
That I don't understand myself
Where I'll wait to return
that I see the danger so much
And I'm so morning the converse
Who brought me to this earth
alone, where has kept
That was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was was wa was wa wa was wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa
And the hope taked in:
I'm scared with myself
how in so little I gave myself
But taking care of this being,
The eyes with that other I looked
from me, if they were vengeful
it's for my evil death: still
it's me I have the pain I'm dying
that of my infinite grief
I was part and cause,
that if it wouldn't take me up
Inside the herbs where I was
more of my eyes I'd be joughing
And as long as I walked,
it would even have been with me
I've been caret of calamities,
When I arrived here day
That to you and to the wrong will,
They were end and I wrong:
Sad that looked in me
that my remediated herds
I'd be fine with me
And it was ordened to me
It's another bad that still was
The bad doesn't know you
Who caused me to you
Sads of my lonely eyes

And in saying this, it seems
You've been traversed in your evil
And like to those that the air dies
Fallt in that sand:
Big space has passed
that was been there without sense
And in this mine has arrived
It's a friend your know
And that sleeped care
It's a good of sandovir.
it's your name, and I've been looking
A girl that had lost
That he loved more than he loved:
This was that stor
To those who loved so much loved
nything of the greatest bedness
that in world has bathed
And that singed a million
And your girl was that
What he was cleating to him, when
They've banished him for her,
Crying he, crying he, crying he, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she crying she, crying she crying she, crying she, crying she, crying she crying she, crying she crying she, crying she crying she, crying she crying she, crying she crying she, crying she, crying she crying she, crying she crying she, crying she, crying she cry

because you found that lands

It's on the side of the side, It's on the side, It's on the side.
in my fields to look
It's other time I've met
These two herders were
It's from the strains of their homelands,
It's not for the good that you wanted;
And for this reason
it's been clear to notice you
it's like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm like
And gave it to suspect
the place and the feeling
You've been much doubting
What would he do here?

Her heart hurted:

I didn't know if it would be right
That jano was in the place
it's new, and it's crazy
it's up to the point of drowning
Into this doubt being
Jano was in a blind
I said a sweeping giving
Be careful, and be more careful:

that you were in another place
And for you, this year
I had to go for this art:
I would see you here
When you'd tell me anyone
The great dry that is
In alentejo, but
I didn't want to see you sheet
Tell me what it would have been that
how much you're so much
or that you've been or lost
If there's a medic, you'll have it:
it makes jano then for getting up
Can't be tired

Jano
I've come to them fields I see
For giving life to this woman of mine
I've seen a desire ended,
it's a big other begin:
To my crasses I gave life
And to me I got to take it off
The Prophecy Is Accomplied
it was good to give me
Seeing my beard dung
it's the over

(She says france) between the herdsmen
All for friends calls
And they say it's given to loves,
I beg you Jano tell me
'cause he tipped you off first
how you charge fatigues
That I hear that it is very true
Pear friends and friends

But why can I do with you?
I'll unravel myself in talking
Why do I know you're my friend
Everything I want to tell you:
No medics, no comforts
I won't be able to ask you

I don't wait to return

I'll see your beard drowsing
Look how you're with you:
To the strange land, you'll go
For your herds, you won't lose
You'll pass long evils
For a lot of short pleasures
that you'll see or don't see
(and giving a little to the head,
It's the way I'm drowsy.
For your good, but grow you
The beard (yes) of honor:
Twisted it in the heart

That still some times will come
Jano, I'll remember you
Tell god to be in vain

You should be, if the dog didn't miss
Sing, france, something
it loves music to sadness
We'll see if you repose me
Where the pain is start;
It's certain I'd say a bone.
I'll sing with my will
Making you like the patient

The girl singed without her
At night when I saw myself,
It's tired of not finding it
it's more than searching for her
I was gone I tossed yesterday
But I'll give you a word
that I couldn't eye close
There before my new,
When everything was silenced
I've began in a fully word,
A shoulder was coming with me:
from afar, it seemed to me
I don't know I would be deceived
that he didn't answer me

But the side song was saying
it's a singing
It's lost and banished
What I'll do where I'll go
After desperate
I've find another pain I've find
Discomforted of me

Where by medic I've come
And repair of my herd:

I'm afraid it'll be forced
'Cause I've been so badly fade
Kill me with my hand
What doesn't make it? I'll make it now.
To those who won't ask me
What's an explanation I'll do now
To those who won't hear me:
It's a smug gift of my love
That covers this dark night
You're lost! You're lost! You're lost! You're lost! You're lost! You're lost! You're lost! You're lost!
Will you make me a grave?
it's so much that I'm lifeless
And put in the grave
Letters that say of this art
The soul is in another place
it appears to the long years
And to the times that will come
that of these grave mistakes of mine
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
It's where sad is
If she can she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she's she'
Tears to have can't
Will my soul be payed
""or what then be of me?""
still that doesn't want anything
Everything is least of passing
that there the eyes sund to take
They ran away telling the days,
The news were made alone
The sads keep like us
Jano this is the singing,
it's like the final cries that it was
And for leaving out of fatigue
I'll confess you I wanted to:
But if the lame and understanding
They don't die with the body, the pain
it will be me: let's go that I feel
it's time for the herd to go to the water
It's also time for the both"

na hora em que eu mais ruía
o sol aplainava o relvado, palmeiras
ondulavam num lago turvo
longe o escaravelho porvindoiro
que as reduziu a um coto
assemelhando-as a um ananás que degrada hoje
pelos jardins
o repuxo animava sem triunfo o pântano
da juventude
as varandas em fogo
o verão começando pelo fim
horas extraordinárias aquelas
em que as aves adiavam o repouso por causa
dos insectos do turno sequente
ourados absortos estrepitantes
a hora em que mais ninguém deitava como eu
a bicicleta sobre a falta
e se sentava na relva prendendo as lágrimas
as mãos tapando o rosto o rosto entre os geolhos e uma
roda atrás a girar
não havia o ecrã de bolso oportuno
era inevitável encarar o que não tem conserto
nem nunca terá
era do dia o instante altíloquo
uma harmónica crepitava nos auscultadores
feria de morte o touro da tarde
esse búfalo ermo que se aparta da manada
para ficar-se
os subidos candeeiros acendiam
havia um muro recém pintado
sujo já por um grafito de província
um cão passava ao largo levantava o focinho ao
perfume dos jantares
que chegava de onde
se entrevia o espalha-cor dos televisores
havia o farrapo de lua
como flanela posta sobre a ganga das alturas
agraudava os dós arrumados
na caixa do futuro
a hédera das extensões percorria aquela hora
uma ideia sulcava a charneca celeste
o coração alpinista no avesso dos volumes
rarefeito
o mundo era já uma seara de nojo
e fartura – belo desastroso feroz – lugar de forças
e destruições
eu tacteava de olhos fechados
puro intrínseco
procurava um celeiro urbano onde guardar
o ouro-sémen pronto a detonar
a libélula extrema o grilo inicial
a andorinha cujo ninho resulta de um cúmulo
de lama e ervas secas e rasoira
as superfícies alimentando-se no ar
nas minhas costas o exíguo refrigério
da biblioteca pública
àquela hora antro de nebulosos soldados
repousando da luta de guerrilha
hasta la derrota, siempre!
infligiam estragos mínimos a um inimigo
bronco mas relutante
apenas tombavam nas emboscadas aqueles
como eu mais sorumbáticos

that moment when i was really falling apart
and the sun lingered over the lawn, and the palms
billowed above the turbid lake
faraway the promised beetle
reduced those palms to a stump
until they seemed like a pineapple which these days
rots in the gardens
the fountain blandly animated the swamp
of the young
the balconies on fire
the summer beginning at its end
overtime hours those
in which the birds delayed their naps because
of the next shift of insects
hallucinating self-absorbed clamorous
at that hour no one else like me setting their bicycle
down on the dearth
sitting on the grass holding back tears
covering their face with their hands, face between their knees and a
wheel behind still spinning
there was no convenient pocket screen
facing up to that which can’t be fixed and never will be
was inevitable
it was on that day the eloquent moment
a harmonica crackled in my headphones
mortally wounding the afternoon’s bull
that solitary buffalo that steers clear of the herd
to die
the high lamps lit up
a newly painted wall
already marked with a small town’s graffito
a dog went past lifting its snout to the
scent of dinners
which came from where
the televisions’ color-blend rose in the air
there was the shred of moon
like flannel sewn onto the denim of the heights
it nurtured hoarded hurt
in the box of the future
the ivy of extensions twined through that hour
an idea furrowed the celestial fen
the mountaineer heart inside the volumes
rarefied
the world was already a glebe of lamentation
and overabundance – beautiful disastrous fierce – locus of forces
and ruin
i fingered with my eyes closed
pure intrinsic
searched out an urban granary where i could keep
the semen-gold ready to detonate
the extreme dragonfly the first cricket
the swallow who got up its nest in a cumulus
of mud and dried weeds who smooths
the surfaces feeding itself in the air
at my back the exiguous cooling
of the public library
at that hour a cavern of nebulous soldiers
resting from their war of resistance
hasta la derrota, siempre!
they inflicted little damage on a rough
but reluctant enemy
only those as sullen as i
walked into ambushes
so many figure eights still visible on the ground
forcefully hoed up from repeatedly going round in the same place
i had dared to go past the gate of the infinite

They would walk in a turbate lake
It's far away from the worry scarab

Remembering them to a dungeon that degrades today

The repuxo agitted without triumnity the pantan
from the youngry
The masts on fire
The summer start by the end
It's an extraordinary time
how the birds postponed the repose for cause

Fair of death the bull of the afternoon

it's in the future's box
The hide of the extensions traversed that time
An idea draped into the celestial charneca
the alpinist heart in the overside of the volumes

The world was already a crazy night

Intrinsic pure
I was searching for an urban house to keep
The hour-semen are gone to detonate

The surfaces flying in the air
On my back the little refrigeration
from the public library
At that time around the nebules of the strength
resing from the guerilla fight
Even the defecation, always!
They would would would would would would would would wouldn't would an enemy

Them would just fall in the embuscadas
just like me more sorobatic
So many eight visible still on the ground
worked with the force to spin in the same place
You'll dare to cross the door of the infinite
it always find slanted on the supper"

entendendo cada um à sua maneira como sempre se
fez, eu adverti logo aliás não tinha nenhuma esperança
que viéssemos a coincidir alguma vez tu achaste claro

aprofundarmo-nos sempre aos apalpões a ver onde derretia
quando lá no fundo doía não encaixarmos perfeita

vezes do que os dedos encontrarmos alguém

disseste que me fazias a vida toda quando apertaste por
baixo dos meus braços a resistência dos materiais, e há de
ter sido gentileza não justificares apesar do orgulho
de cumprir proezas não contamos os princípios nem os fins
fico pois à espera que apareças atrás de um sms com uma tarte
de maçã encostada ao focinho, que não te cansa o jogo de fazeres
todos os gestos importantes entre portas para depois te pores ao
fresco como se nada fosse e largas daqui porque tens um handicap

made a fool of myself, maybe it was there because we wrote about it
each one understanding in his own way just as it’s always
been, though i warned you at once that i had no hope
we’d ever coincide you thought sure excellent because
that way we’d constantly want to probe each other
always pinching ourselves to see where it touched
there in the depths where it hurt not to fit perfectly
together, only that yes it’s a privilege it happens fewer
times than we have fingers finding
someone who we want to keep beating as
you said you would do to me for a lifetime when you squeezed
the resistance of material below my arms, and it must have
been delicacy not to justify yourself despite the pride
of performing feats we never count the beginnings or the ends

pie hoisted to your muzzle, that the game of making all those
important gestures in the doorway doesn’t exhaust you so later

i specify: it's terracotta, it cracks
and i am sparse in dense fluidity.
too late, i know, help will come, if ever
so feebly i flash in obscurity
and the writing does not stay on water;
here i lie: hardly an erasure, less
than a seam the wave will slowly stitch
a slumbering quilt over where i sink.",pt_XX,en_XX,"it's a woman by the sea

And I'm spased, and the solid liquidity.

What gives me pleasure and something to do.
But it's not said still (or is) if I insist

galopamos pelas costas dos montes no interior
da terra a comer eucaliptos a comer os entulhos de feno
a cuspir o vento a cuspir o tempo a cuspir

o tempo que os comboios do sentido contrário engolem
do sentido contrário roubam-nos o tempo meu amor
preciso de ti que vens voando
até mim
mas voas à vela sobre o mar
e tens espaço asas por isso vogas à deriva enquanto eu
vou rastejando ao teu encontro sobre os carris faiscando
ocasionalmente e escrevo para ti meu amor
a enganar a tua ausência a claustrofobia de cortinas
cor de mostarda tu caminhas sobre a água e agora
eu sei
as palavras valem menos do que os barcos
preciso de ti meu amor nesta solidão neste desamparo
de cortinas espessas que impedem o sol que me impedem
de voar e ainda assim do outro lado

we ride down the backs of hills inside
the earth eating eucalyptus eating haystacks
spitting out the wind spitting out time spitting out

time the trains gulp the opposite way going
the opposite way stealing our time my love
i need you who are flying
to me
but you fly unfurling sails over the sea
you have wing-space you hover you drift while i
keep crawling towards you along the rails
with occasional sparks i write to you my love
cheating your absence the claustrophobia of the mustard
colored curtains you walk on water and now
i know
words are less worthy than boats
i need you my love in this loneliness this forsakenness
of thick curtains preventing the sun preventing my
flight and nevertheless on the opposite side
the sky boasts little lamb clouds hopping
hopping on oats and wheat fields there are none here
we eat eucalyptus eucalyptus and whitewashed churches
leaning over level-crossing whitewashed churches

are so sad people are pathetic my

am also a boat sitting on top of your body

a hundred years from today we’ll be boats again

set ablaze inside lobo antunes’ novel
we eat eucalyptus and portugal is everlasting portugal
is huge and i need you and in the opposite way they are stealing

But you're flying away the sea
And you have space wings that's why you fly adrift as long as I
I'm craming to your date on the beaching paths
Casually and I write for you my love
Deceived your absence from the claustrophobia of drapes
Color of mostarda you walk on the water and now
I know
The words are worth less than the ships
I need you my love in this loneliness in this desampary
With burden drapes that stop the sun that stop me
to fly and still on the other side
The sky shows small clouds small carniorines smalling
That's walking about one nights and trigals here, there's not

foi como amor aquilo que fizemos

o termos juntos sexo com ternura
num clima de aparato e de sigilo.
se virmos bem ninguém foi iludido

was it circus or siege, gesture or style
the act of embracing? was it candor
such tenderness together such ardor
in a climate of luxury and guile?
the thing we did, was it the same as love,
or tacit touch? the two of us in want
and morningless, yielding to the moment;
getting fucked was an awkward move.
seen objectively, no one was deluded
it was the real thing – only the placebo
with some excess accelerates the libido.

It's in an air of apparatus and secret.

olho-a:
doce o vértice no ângulo da maxila

pastagens boreais

colado ao calar-se

no horizonte a cordilheira
elevação menos intransponível
que a planície do vivido
despedimo-nos do musgo úvido
digitado entre coxas
sacudimos o que sobrou do gozo
o pequeno lumaréu que à boca do abrigo
longas frias horas crepitou
atufamos mochilas
testados couros e ataduras
aprumados os cabelos
levamos aos dentes um pouco de farinha
fiapos de carne seca
tragos de café fumegante
nós, soldadas de alexandre
a quem o whiskey dos serões jamais tombou
e as botas não pesam
nem vexam as febres
o rectângulo onde a tenda demorou
ficará por um tempo assinalado no gazão
com as pedras a rodear o que foi
a labareda cintilante que depois negrejou
e é pasto para o faro da medrosa
fauna que virá
sondar esta parte sujada do lugar
por essa altura o nosso odor
planará por ravinas desfiladeiros
misturado com o pó e o estrépito dos cascos com que
erramos à beira dos abismos
produziremos ecos de que o nosso pudor
se acanhará

dos penhascos –
e duras, róridas, raras

i’m watching her:
sweet the alp in the angle of her jaw
when she wakes
the canvas soaked at dawn
the grass outside darkens just as the sun rising
dilutes sleep
the mules feed off the fleeting
boreal pastures
before us a way opens up
luminously
glued to keeping quiet
to moving
but a breeze already inflames
making us want for a lake, placing
a range on the horizon
a less uncrossable elevation
than the lowlands of lived life
we say goodbye to the humid moss
fingered between thighs
stir the last pleasure out of the little
campfire that crackled
at the shelter’s opening through the long cold hours
we stuff rucksacks
leather and straps tested
we fixed our hair
munch a bit of flour
shredded bits of jerky
swigs of steaming coffee
we, the soldiers of alexander
whom nights of whiskey never fell
whose boots don’t weigh a thing
nor shame the fevers
the rectangle left by the tent
will remain for a while marking the plot of grass
stones ringing what had been
a scintillating flame later gone dark
now pasture to the scent of the timid
animals that will wander in
sounding out this sullied bit of the scene
at this very moment our scent
sails through narrow ravines
mixed with the dust and the clamor of hoofs that brings us
straying close on the edge of precipices
our own echoing
will embarrass us
but within – more silence even than the gorse
on the cliff sides –
and hardened, soaked with mist, atypical
arching over our maps
opening compasses
jotting quick notes about the way
and the error
more goat than us more mountainous: life
this leather hard to tan",pt_XX,en_XX,"[Annemarie schwarzenbach]

hands locked? your eyes, which briefly
studied mine, how they look sad!

its silently triumphant petals coating
the ground, in the acropolis of ice.

With your hands? your eyes, that a moment
They looked in mine, how sadly they go!

é-me indiferente: poeta, poetisa
dependerá do ritmo ou da medida –
prefiro tradutora, mas admito
que por vezes não dobro e sou narcisa.
2.
a minha primeira poesia era
sobre chuva e choro. hoje seria
prosa, ou sobre chuva e a pólvora:
chove fora viola o vento o vidro,
a rua nunca é como os prospectos –
o meu bilhete ao mundo, espeto-o
com delicado verbo ao coração.
rebenta, murcho músculo entupido –
mil vezes fosse a vida a excepção.
3.
se o rigor do verso não visa qualquer prova
senão procura –
ou provar o que seja de sabor.
se não escrevo por encomenda
senão por ventura serôdia
4.
posso posar, certamente,
para a máquina fotográfica,
moldar a boca ao disparo ou regular
a abertura ao diafragma. dependente
do papel revelador –
modelo artista presa, sou como todos:
as vidas que não toco interessam-me
num desequilíbrio de voracidade e avareza.
antes ainda assim me conheçam de vista
que de revista.","introductory text
1.
for me it makes little difference: poet, poetess –
depends on the measure, and the stress –
i prefer translator, but admit
that i sometimes can’t be plied, i’m a narcissist.
2.
my earliest poetry was about rain
and weeping. today it would be
prose and rain, or gunpowder:
it's raining out, wind rapes the window,
a street is never like the brochures –
with fine eloquence i stab my note
to the world through my heart.
it bursts, withered muscle bloat –
a thousand times that life were more than art.
3.
if the line’s strict measure doesn’t aim to show
but is a seeking instead –
or is the taste of what it finds . . .
if i don’t write to order,
but showered by latter rain.
4.
certainly, i can pose
for the camera,
mold my mouth to the click, close
down the diaphragm. it depends
how the roll is developed –
model artist prey, i’m like everyone:
the lives i don’t touch interest me
in uneven parts of avarice and voracity.
before they know me, period,
they know me periodically.",pt_XX,en_XX,"it's a text for the presentation

I'm infferent: poetry, poetry
Will depend on the pace or the measure –
I'd rather be a traducer, but I'll admit
That sometimes I don't double and I'm narciss.

My first poetry was
about rain and crying. Today would be
Through, or on the rain and the power:
it rains out the wind purposes the glass,
The street is never like the prospects –
My ticket to the world, I'll step it
it's with a delightful verb to the heart.
it burns, difference of entupid muscle –
A thousand times life was the exception.

a matéria do poema expande, arrefece
tão estranhamente se demora e permanece
semelhando o universo
o poema é a imagem-espelho de um corpo
sem reflexo: a poesia
oco assimétrico, residual desse princípio
colocada em lugar dubitativo, separada quase sempre
do buraco negro a que chamam literatura
poder-se-á supor que poucos são os poetas
capazes de acelerar partículas
de modo a ver-se não só o que a luz já percorreu
mas a região mais central do nada, o pátio
furioso da potência
e neste lugar de substâncias, de objectos
as palavras são figuras do imundo, coisas que
sobraram do estampido inaugural desse dia inicial inteiro
e limpo que culminou no lugar a menos deste texto
breve logaritmo sem aplicação ou saída
resta ao poeta o embuste
de afirmar o que propende para o infindo
espiar o acesso que cada coisa consente pela fissura do milagre
e dá pelo nome de imprevisto, ou acidente
a criança na rua abrindo o caixote do lixo
onde alguém sem saber depositou o assombro de um
balão de hélio branco ainda cheio
que se soltou e subiu à laia de lua ao fim da tarde
ao pé de casa
a criança pasmou, entristeceu depois
mais tarde lembrou-se: tens de escrever um poema sobre o balão
que voou do lixo e não agarrámos
um poema é a coisa mais triste que há

the big bang’s nimble plagiarism
the poem’s matter expands, cools
it lingers so oddly then stays put
similar to the universe
the poem is a mirror image of the body
with no reflection: hollow
asymmetrical, vestiges of that origin
positioned in a dubious place, nearly always apart
from the black hole they call literature
it might be imagined that few are the poets
capable of accelerating particles
as a way of seeing not only the distance the light has covered
but the central region of nihility, the furious
patio of power
and in this place of substances, of objects
the words are figures of waste, things
left over from the inaugural detonation of this first clean
whole day that climaxed in the minus-one ground of this brief logarithmic
text, purposeless and without any application
it’s the poet’s ruse:
to voice what leans into the infinite
to secretly observe the access each thing allows through the fissure of miracle
and which goes by the name of chance, or accident
the child in the street opening the trash can
where someone without realizing threw out the marvel
of a white helium balloon still full
that bounced up and rose in the guise of the moon in the late afternoon
right in front of the house
at first the child was astonished, then sad
and later remembered: you have to write a poem about the balloon
which flew out of the rubbish and how we didn’t grab it
a poem is the saddest thing there is
and i wrote",pt_XX,en_XX,"it's unworldly
it's a big-bang smooth plagiarism
The material of the poem expands, cools
It's so strangely if it takes and it stays
Seeming the universe
The poem is the image-spare of a body
Without a reflex: poetry
Aximetric oce, remaining of that principle
placed in a doubtful place, separated almost always
from the black Hole that they call little
it will be possible to suppose that the poets are little
Able to expel particles
in a way to see it not only what the light has already traversed
But the most central region of nothing, the court
It's fury of power
And in this place of substances, of objects
Words are figures of the filth, things that
The open of the inaugural stampide of this whole first day
it's clear that upped in place at least of this text
it's a short logo without application or out
The poet remains the stuck
of affirming what it propenses for the endless
To spie the access that everything conffers by the fissure of the miracle
And it's by the name of an accident, or an accident
the children on the street opening the caixote of the filth
Where someone without knowing deposited the astonishment of a
White helio bale still full
that left and rose to the moon's lay in the end of the afternoon

diz-se que matou o próprio irmão,
que descende do sol e solo bárbaro,
e que, deslumbrada por jovem prático
e pouco espiritual, lhe deu
um animal de lã dourada. ele
porém ainda quis um trono, outro
matrimónio e o mando dum país.
quando uma feiticeira chora invoca
demónios que invocam malefícios.
o escritor, atento ao móbil, fixa
os joelhos da semideusa mágica
e empático pinta-lhe na boca
a palavra trágica: eu nada quis
para mim, por ti só tudo fiz.
e o mundo entretém no seu decurso
o público. do crime participa
quem dele tira prémio ou espanto –
e o pranto corre a cada livre gesto
e o excesso com que sofre nos consola
o sobressalto. e o manto que tece
sufoca em chamas e excita deveras
o sangue a correr e a carne a arder.
resta um par de cadáveres infantis
aos pés do pai: o céu está vazio
e ninguém saiu ainda da sala.
para concluir o acto o génio
declara solene que ali se ama
e mata sobre a cena. não mais
discursos. inclina-se e repousa
a pena com a ponta de veneno.","medea
they say she killed her own brother,
descends from the sun and barbarian soil,
and gave an animal with golden fur
to a practical, not very spiritual young man
who had taken her breath away. but he
also wanted a throne, a second
wife and a country to rule.
when a sorceress weeps she invokes
demons who invoke curses.
the writer, aware of her motive, steadies
the knees of the magic demigoddess
and empathically paints on her mouth
the tragic words: i wanted nothing
for myself, i did it all for you.
and the course of the world entertains
the audience, the crime’s accomplices,
those it profited and those it petrified.
and tears roll with each free motion,
and the acuteness of her suffering softens
our shock. the cloak she weaves
smothers with flames, and the spurting
blood and burning flesh truly excite us.
what remains is a pair of infant corpses
at their father’s feet: the sky is empty
and no one has yet left the hall.

solemnly declares that there, on stage,
people love and kill. no more
speeches. he leans back and sets down
his pen with its poisonous nib.",pt_XX,en_XX,"That's medeia

The Tragic Word: I didn't want anything
For me, for you I've only donething.
And the world amuses in his course
the public. of the crime participates
It's who takes price or astonishment from him
And the cry runs to every free gesture
And the excess with which suffers on us
The surrode. And the manger that wews
Suffocates in flames and excites really
The blood running and the blood burning.
There's a couple of children't corps
At the feet of the father: the sky is empty
And no one's left away from the room.
To end the deed the genie
Declares soleness that there is loved
And kills about the scene. No more
girls. girls and reposes
The pain with the tip of venison."

my hands in inward prayer, weeping!

metade solar outra metade
adentrada na noite que divide e reparte irmãmente os dois
pedaços da mesma ideia:
redonda achatada nos polos insegura no seu tombo
escuridão afora
a cabeça pendular metida entre ombros
sombras
na órbita do absurdo a cumprir a curvatura que lhe cabe
errando distorcendo a silenciosa
nitidez dos hemisférios
enfeitada de gázeos, orifícios, rodeada
de visíveis
desprendem-se dela panoramas que flutuam até
muito depois, tortuosos
brincando de se mostrar de se encobrir na açoteia
dos eventos
onde uma língua lambe partículas, intenta locuções
ou a mudez dos vaga-lumes
mas tudo de tudo se afasta
por mais que um braço nosso se retese para o nada
partindo do centro, desalcançando
e o todo se despenhe, móbil
veloz rebobinado, o retroverso inteiro, e vejamos passar
pelo buraco de uma agulha o camelo
do raciocínio
e neva nesta geometria
tanto
resplandece muito como se às mãos um lume
viesse entreter as trevas
estamos assim sobre o rosto da terra
queimando as ervas
enterrando os sinais
inclinando a esfera do pensamento para a água
seguimos por pequenas pistas ano a ano
menos nítidas
o sono alaga submerge com um peso nocturno
o corpo treme de anonimato
é no sossego de um quarto extinto rumoroso
que a nossa esfera abate na mole dos seus fantasmas
o tecto abre ao incêndio celeste
a outra e à única claridade
e nesse vácuo ou abertura nesse
floco de neve ampliado uma magnólia floresce e floresce
a sequóia imensa do mundo recolhe
à potestade
enquanto o lugar das medidas dos medos e das merdas
arrefece na lâmpada do tecto
aquietam-se em ocultas complexidões as ondas
órfãs do disjuntor
frequentam vibrações fabulares exteriores à evidência
declinam
e o adágio em que demoliu a luz
acendeu na respiração profunda dos alvéolos
enquanto uma frágil estrela se acende no azul
para um percival de olhos fechados","mcmlxxxvi
half solar the other half
plunged in night that divides and fraternally shares two
scraps of the same idea:
round flattened at the poles insecure in its fall
out of darkness
the pendular head sunk between shoulders
shadows
the orbit of the absurd fulfilling its incumbent curvature
wandering distorting the silent
clarity of hemispheres
festooned in eyes of beryl, orifices, surrounded
by visibilities
panoramas breaking off that linger
long afterwards, coiling
a game of veiling and unveiling on the rooftop terrace
of events
where a tongue licks particles, proffers phrases
or the muteness of fireflies
but everything scatters from everything else
even though we thrust an arm into the void
out from the center, it’s thwarted
and everything crashes, velocious
mobile rewinding, an utter retroversion, and we can see
the camel of reason
pass through the eye of a needle
and it snows in this geometry
such
resplendence really as though a flame were handed to us
to fill the darkness
this is how we are upon the the face of the earth
burning the weeds
burying the signs
tipping the sphere of thinking into the water
each year we go down a series of narrow paths
ever dimmer
inundated, sleep is submerged under nocturnal weight
the body shudders with anonymity
it’s in the calm of a room humming with death
that our sphere falls into its crowd of ghosts
the ceiling opens on the celestial fire
on a different, a singular clarity
and in this emptiness, this opening, in this
high burgeoning snowflake a magnolia blooms and blooms
the immense sequoia of the world retires
to its dominion
while dimensions of fear and crap cool in their own venue
the naked bulb in the middle of the ceiling
the orphan waves of the circuit breaker are hushed
in hidden complexities
attend to fable-like vibrations beyond evidence
fade
and the adagio that demolished the light
erupted in the heavy breath of alveoli
as a fragile star lit up in the blue

"a europa em roterdão
dói-me o coração da europa, com as suas veias inchadas
pelo vento do ocidente, e as mãos gretadas pelo gelo
dos invernos. sentei-me com a europa num bar de roterdão,
desenhando na cabeça os mapas do mundo; e obriguei-a
a beber o café holandês, com os seus lábios doentes,
como se a europa não fosse o continente insone
dos últimos milénios, varrido pelos temporais da
mitologia, de crença abalada por um terror ateu.
vi a europa nesse café de roterdão, antes de sair
para as ruas desenhadas a compasso e esquadro;
perguntei-lhe para onde queria ir; e ouvi o seu
murmúrio despir-se de uma palidez plural, como
se ela quisesse ser o rosto único da multidão,
e passear num anonimato de rua cosmopolita,
ouvindo as vozes que lhe falam de ilhas e praias,
restituindo-lhe um sonho de antigas viagens.
vejo nos seus olhos um reflexo das gruas e
guindastes do porto de roterdão, e apago-o com
a borracha da eternidade, para que ela se sente
na esplanada onde lhe peço que me fale; e
ela olha-me, em silêncio, com a voz alucinada
num eco de loucura; e ouço-a dizer-me que
não sabe em que tempo vive, como se fosse
eu que lhe tivesse de ensinar o caminho.
pego na sua mão; e ela desfaz-se nas linhas
improváveis do poema, onde se projecta uma
sombra que eu perco, na noite de roterdão.","europe in rotterdam
the heart of europe is hurting me, with its veins swollen
by the wind out of the west, and its hands cracked by the ice
of winters. i sat down with europe in a rotterdam bar,
drawing the maps of the world in my mind; i made her
drink a dutch coffee, with her sick lips,
as though europe were not the insomniac continent
of the latest millennia, swept by the storms of
mythology, belief shaken by an atheist terror.
i saw europe in that café in rotterdam, before going out
into the streets drawn by compass and set square;
i asked her where she would like to go; and heard her
murmur slip out of her plural paleness, as though
she’d wanted to be the crowd’s single face,
and walk anonymously down the cosmopolitan street,
hearing the voices which speak of to her of islands and beaches,
that restore her dream of ancient voyages.
in her eyes i see a reflection of the cranes and
winches of rotterdam port, and i rub it out
with eternity’s eraser, so that she’ll sit
on the esplanade where i ask her to talk to me; and
she looks at me, in silence, with her voice crazed
by an echo of madness; and i listen to her tell me that
she doesn’t know what period she lives in, as though
it had to be me that had shown her the path.

Drinking the dutch coffee, with your bad lips,
As if europe wasn't the soune continent
of the last Millenies, wrished by the temporals of the
Mythology, of believe rocked by an atheist terror.
I saw europe in this coffe de rotterão, before leaving
For the streets, the bar and the bar;
I asked where he wanted to go; and heard his
Murmurius undresses from a plural palidity, like
If she wanted to be the unique face of the people,
And walking in an anonymity of cosmopolitan street,
Hearing the voices that tell you of islands and beachs,
Giving it a dream of old trips.
I see in your eyes a reflex of the greats and
You carrying from the port of rondness, and I erase it with
it's the eternity's embrace, so she can feel
On the plank where I ask you to talk to me; and
She looks at me, in silence, with her voice hallucinated
In an echo of crazy; and I hear her tell me that
You don't know what time you live in, as if it was
I would have to teach the path to her.
I take it in her hand; and she undoes it in the lines
It's improbable of the poem, where it's a plan
Shadow that I lose, in the night of routine."

naquele ano a chuva foi excessiva e cresceram tortulhos
nos olhos dos cães. os vitelos, ao espreitar a luz pelos sexos
das mães, afogavam-se em lama, no meio dos sambos. as paredes
das casas diluíam-se em nata e os oleiros desistiram de encomendar
a sua obra a deus. enormes cuidados foram inventados
para proteger o fogo nos altares e as crianças adoptaram a nudez.
as termiteiras deixaram de existir e as formigas aladas
perderam as asas. os pés dos mais-velhos fenderam-se em chagas
e as mamas das virgens, mal eram tocadas, colavam-se aos dedos
como cinza húmida. os lábios dos sexos das mulheres paridas
inchavam carnudos de uma carne branca e os ventres pendiam
como fruta mole.
naquele ano a chuva foi excessiva
e os horizontes deixaram de existir.
choveu por muito tempo até os cães perderem todo o pêlo
e as cabeleiras se destacarem como algas podres. o rei do jau
ficou colado ao trono e ao boi sagrado cresceram-lhe os olhos,
que depois cegaram. as sementes grelaram nos celeiros
e essa semente assim era servida aos homens e daí lhes ocorreu
um tal vigor que os seus sexos cresceram desmedidos
e os homens vacilaram, tendo-os nas mãos e mudos de fascínio.
a chuva choveu tanto que as serpentes saíram dos buracos
e vieram alongar-se ao pé dos paus, mantendo com esforço
as cabeças erguidas. nas terrinas do leite vicejavam musgos
e o leite das vacas alterou-se em soro, a coalhar na urina.
naquele ano a chuva choveu tanto que até nos areais cresceram
talos e as enxurradas produziram peixe e até o ferro se lavou
sozinho e os diamantes vieram rebolar nas pedras concavadas
de moer farinha. as próprias aves morreram quase todas
e apenas se salvaram as de penas brancas, que a distância atraiu,
depois comeu.
e aquela chuva aproveitou aos fósseis e houve minerais
que se animaram e até pedras comuns a transmudar-se em carne.
naquele ano a chuva choveu tanto que a memória perdeu todo
o sentido. as gargantas entupiram-se de limos
e as testas que os velhos pousavam nas mãos fundiam-se aos dedos
e os braços às pernas e os gestos de graça fundiam os corpos
e as jovens crianças ficavam coladas ao peito das mães.
só as bocas teimavam em manter-se abertas e quando mais tarde
a chuva parou, das bocas saíram grossas aves negras
que abalaram logo daquelas paragens. e a seca voltou
e o mundo secou. a carne antiga a dar-se agora em terra,
os fósseis em pedra e as ramas em húmus.
e os passos poliram pouco a pouco as formas.
naquele ano a chuva choveu tanto
que a memória nunca mais teve sentido.","sign
that was the year that the rains were excessive and mushrooms grew
in dogs’ eyes. the young bulls, looking out at the light from their mother’s crotches, drowned in the mud, in the middle of the vines. the walls of the houses dissolved in cream and the potters no longer entrusted their work to god. enormous measures were invented
to protect the altar flames and the children started to run around naked.
the termitaries ceased to exist and winged ants lost their wings. the feet of the oldest ones split open in sores and the breasts of virgins, as soon as you touched them, stuck to your fingers like wet ash. the lips of the birthing womens’ sex swelled plumply like white meat and their bellies hung like soft fruit.
that was the year the rain was excessive and the horizon ceased to exist.
it rained forever until the dogs lost all their fur and people’s hair stuck out like rotten seaweed. the king of jau got stuck to his throne and the sacred bullock’s eyes grew larger, and then went blind. the seed sprouted in the granaries and then it was served up to the men, just like that, and they were infused with such vigor that their cocks grew immeasurably and they reeled about, with the things in their hands, mute with the magic.
the rain rained so much that the snakes left their snake-holes
and stretched out next to sticks, raising their heads
with only the greatest effort. moss multiplied in the tureens of milk
and the milk of cows turned to whey which curdled in urine.
that year the rain rained so much that even the beaches grew
branches and the rushing streams spawned fish and even the iron washed itself alone and diamonds started to tumble around the stones hollowed out for milling flour. the birds themselves nearly all died and the only ones that saved themselves were those with white feathers, which the distance attracted, then ate.
and the rain was good for fossils, and there were minerals
that came alive and even common stones that were transmuted into
flesh.
that year the rain rained so much that memory was rendered
meaningless. throats were clogged with sludge and the brows that the aged held in their hands fused with their fingers,
and their arms fused to their legs and their graceful gestures smelt their bodies and the youngest children ended up glued to their mothers’ breasts.
only our mouths dared to remain open and when the rain
finally stopped, huge black birds flew from them and disappeared into the distance. and the drought came back and the world dried out. now the ancient flesh has turned to dirt,
the fossils to stone and the branches to humus.
and footsteps gradually polished the forms.

Your work to god. Huge cares was invented
To protect the fire on the altars and the children agained nudity.
The termiteries no longer exist and the ants flow
They lost the wings. The feet of the oldest brooded in bedness.
And the bosoms of the Virgins, didly touched, clung to the fingers
just like wet Ash. The lips of the sexs of paried women
The carnuts rained from a white carnage and the twots clung
it's like smoky fruit.
In that year the rain was excessive
And the horizons no longer exist.
It was rained for a long time even the dogs lose all the fur
And the hairs stand over like marbled seaweeds. The king of the jaw
it was cold to the throng and to the hold bull the eyes grow,
that then didnessed. The seeds grailed in the ceilers.
And that seed was served to men, and then has come to them.
a vigor that his sexs has grow dimly
And men wasciled, having them in the hands and much of fascition.
The rain has rained so much that the serpents left out of the hoves
And they come to elongate by the foot of the foots, staying with effort
The heads rose. In the burrows of the bed, the mosses adjoined.
And the latte of the cows changed to sare, curling in the urine.
In that year the rain rained so much that it even grow in the sands
Things and the blushes produce fish and even the iron was launded
alone and the diamonds came up in the concaved rocks
The own birds died almost everything
And only the white of white pains, that distance has atracted,
And then, you eat.
And that rain laughed to the foals and there was minerals
That has been angioused and even common stoness transmuding into the best.
In that year the rain rained so much that the memory lost everything
the sense. The goats uppered with limos
And the heads that the olds looked in the hands melt to the fingers
And the arms with the legs and the gestures of grace flow the bodys
And the young children keep keep to the chest of the mothers.
Just the mouths wanted to stay open and when later
The rain stopped, from the mouths the bigs went out
Them who went away from that storms. And the drying came back.
And the world has driered. The old carn giving it now on the ground,
The fossels in stone and the boughs in hummus.

"poema
as coisas mais simples, ouço-as no intervalo
do vento, quando um simples bater de chuva nos
vidros rompe o silêncio da noite, e o seu ritmo
se sobrepõe ao das palavras. por vezes, é uma
voz cansada, que repete incansavelmente
o que a noite ensina a quem a vive; de outras
vezes, corre, apressada, atropelando sentidos
e frases como se quisesse chegar ao fim, mais
depressa do que a madrugada. são coisas simples
como a areia que se apanha, e escorre por
entre os dedos enquanto os olhos procuram
uma linha nítida no horizonte; ou são as
coisas que subitamente lembramos, quando
o sol emerge num breve rasgão de nuvem.
estas são as coisas que passam, quando o vento
fica; e são elas que tentamos lembrar, como
se as tivéssemos ouvido, e o ruído da chuva nos
vidros não tivesse apagado a sua voz.","poem
it’s the simplest things that i hear in the wind’s
intervals, when the simple beating of the rain
on the windows breaks the silence of night, and its rhythm
overwhelms that of words. sometimes, it is a
tired voice, that tirelessly repeats
what the night teaches those who live it; other
times, it runs, hurriedly, mowing down meanings
and phrases as though it wanted to reach the end, more
quickly than the dawn. we’re talking about simple things,
like the sand which is scooped up, and runs
through your fingers while your eyes search
for a clear line on the horizon; or things
that we suddenly remember, when
the sun emerges from a brief tear in the clouds.
these are the things that happen, when the wind
remains; and it is these we try to recall, as though
we had heard them, and the noise of the rain
on the windowpanes had not snuffed out their voice.",pt_XX,en_XX,"Poem
The simplest of things, I hear them in the intermission
from the wind, when a simple rain beats us
glasses bring the silence of the night, and their rhythm
It's superimposed to the words. Sometimes, it's a
tired voice, that repects inexhaustly
What the night teachs to those who live it; others
times, run, hurt, runking senses
And phrases as if you wanted to come to an end, more
It's faster than the morning. It's simple things
just like the sand that gets up, and lives by
between your fingers as your eyes look
a clear line on the horizon; or the
things that we supendly remember, when
The sun emerges in a short hug of a cloud.
That are the things that go by, when the wind
it stays; and it's them that we try to remember, as
If we had heard them, and the night of the rain in us,
glases wouldn't have erased your voice."

"os figos de d.h. lawrence
lawrence aconselhou a que se partisse um figo
em quatro pedaços, para o comer, depois de deitar fora
a casca. deste modo, pensava ele, a sociedade não veria
com maus olhos o gesto de cortar o figo, e de o
saborear lentamente, como quem lê um poema. mas
nem todos os figos se podem comer desta maneira; e,
no caso dos figos verdes, o melhor é tirar-lhes a pele a
partir de cima, sem que ela se desprenda completamente
do fruto; e só depois de comer a parte de cima, é que
chegará o momento em que só vai ficar um pouco de figo
a segurar a casca. nessa altura, pode-se arrancá-la, e acabar
de comer o que sobra, para que a refeição fique completa.
de facto, lawrence também admite esta solução (e
aceita que se coma também a casca); mas teremos
de ir mais longe do que ele, o que significa
que se deve também pensar na figueira. e se, ao comermos
o figo, a árvore nos agarra a alma com os seus ramos
ásperos, obrigando-nos a afastar as folhas para ver como
é que se pode fugir debaixo dela, o sabor que fica na boca
lembra a imagem da mulher primitiva, com o seu ventre redondo
como o dos figos de s. joão, os primeiros, que se colhem
com um gesto só, ficando inteiros na mão. então, a mão
torna-se um prolongamento da figueira, e começo a pensar
que talvez possam nascer folhas de figueira nos braços,
como se estes fossem ramos; e que essas folhas servirão para
tapar os figos que irei colher, mantendo a sua frescura.
em alternativa, poderei transformar o tronco da figueira
num corpo de mulher nua; e essas folhas irão vesti-la. mas o figo
que tenho na mão far-me-á sentir os seus seios macios, fazendo
com que, ao tirar a casca do figo, a mulher saia de dentro dele,
e eu possa chegar à mesma conclusão de lawrence sobre
as múltiplas formas de comer um figo.","d.h. lawrence’s figs
lawrence recommended that the fig be divided into
into four pieces, for eating, after discarding
the skin. in this way, he reasoned, society would not look
askance upon the act of cutting open the fig and of
savoring it slowly, as one would read a poem. but
not all figs can be eaten in such a way; and
in the case of green figs, it’s better to skin them from
the top down, without separating the skin completely
from the fruit; it’s only after eating the top part, that
the moment arrives where there is only a bit of fig left
clinging to its skin. then you can finally pluck it, and finish
eating what is left, for the meal to be complete.
indeed, lawrence also acknowledges this solution (and
also says it’s okay to eat the skin); but we must
go even further than he does, which means that we must
also consider the tree itself. and if, while we’re eating
the fig, the tree grabs our soul with its rough
branches, making it necessary to pull back its leaves to see how
it is we can escape beneath it, the taste which lingers in the mouth
recalls the image of the primitive woman, with her round womb
like the one of the early figs of saint john, the first ones, that are gathered up
whole, in one sweep of the hand. so, my hand
becomes an extension of the fig tree, and i begin to think
that perhaps fig leaves will start growing from my arms,
as though they were branches; and that these leaves will hide
the figs that i will gather, keeping them fresh.
alternatively, i could transform the trunk of the fig tree
into the body of a naked woman; and these leaves would adorn her. but the fig
that i have in my hand will make me feel her soft breasts, making
it seem like in stripping the skin from the fig the woman might appear from within,
and i would reach the same conclusion as lawrence about
the many ways to eat a fig.",pt_XX,en_XX,"The figs of d.h. lawrence
Lawrence advised if I did a fig
In four pieces, to eat it, after down
The shoal. In this way, he thought, the society wouldn't see
With bad eyes the gesture of slicing the fig, and of the
Taste slowly, like the one who reads a poem. But
it's not possible for all figs to eat in this way; and,
in the case of the green figs, the best is to take off their skin
it leaves from the top, without it understanding at all
from the fruit; and only after eat the top part, it is that
It will come the moment when it will just stay a little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little li

To eat what's left, so the same will be full.
de facto, lawrence also admits this solution (and
it accepts that the shoal is also eat; but we will have
to go further than he does, what does

Remembers the image of the pristive woman, with her round bird
just like the figs of Saint John, the first, who see up
with a just gesture, staying entire in the hand. So, the hand
it turns to be a prolongation of the fig, and I stay to think
that may may firt leaves can be born in the arms,
just as if these were broths; and that these leafs will serve to
Tighten the figs I'm going to cull, keeping their coolness.
As an alternative, I'll be able to transform the firt of the firt
Into a body of a nake woman; and these leafs will dress her. But the fig

"minha pátria
minha pátria não é a língua portuguesa.
nenhuma língua é a pátria.
minha pátria é a terra mole e peganhenta onde nasci
e o vento que sopra em maceió.
são os caranguejos que correm na lama dos mangues
e o oceano cujas ondas continuam molhando os meus pés quando sonho.
minha pátria são os morcegos suspensos no forro das igrejas carcomidas,
os loucos que dançam ao entardecer no hospício junto ao mar,
e o céu encurvado pelas constelações.
minha pátria são os apitos dos navios
e o farol no alto da colina.
minha pátria é a mão do mendigo na manhã radiosa.
são os estaleiros apodrecidos
e os cemitérios marinhos onde os meus ancestrais tuberculosos e implaudados não não param de tossir e tremer nas noite frias
e o cheiro de açúcar nos armazéns portuários
e as tainhas que se debatem nas redes dos pescadores
e as résteas de cebola enrodilhadas na treva
e a chuva que cai sobre os currais de peixe.
a língua de que me utilizo não é e nunca foi a minha pátria.
nenhuma língua enganosa é a pátria.
ela serve apenas para que eu celebre a minha grande e pobre pátria muda,
minha pátria desintérica e desdentada, sem gramática e sem dicionário,
minha pátria sem língua e sem palavras.","my home
the portuguese language is not my home.
no language is a home.
my home is the soft and viscous land where i was born
and the waft of the wind in maceió.
it is the crabs scurrying through the muck of mangrove swamps
and the ocean whose waves still wet my feet when i dream.
my home is bats hanging from the ceiling of churches in decay,
madmen dancing at sunset in the asylum by the sea,
and the sky curved round by constellations.
my home is the sound of the ship’s horn
and the lighthouse high on the hill.
my home is the beggar’s hand in radiant morning.
and the rotting shipyards
and the graves by the sea where my ancestors, consumptive
and malarial, can’t stop coughing and trembling on cold nights
and the smell of sugar in warehouses along the wharves
and mullets struggling in the fishermen’s nets
and strands of onions tangled in the dark
and rain falling over the fish pens.
the language i use is not and never was my home.

my dysentery-ridden toothless home, devoid of grammar books and dictionaries,

My homeland is not the portuguese word.
No word is the fatherland.
My fatherland is the smoky, smoky land where I was born
And the wind that blows in greats.
It's the caragues that run in the much of mangoes
And the ocean, which waves continue to wet my feet when I dream.
My homeland are the bats stopped in the fur of the charmed girls,
The crazy who dance in the midness by the sea,
And the sky curved by the constelations.
My homeland are the bells of the ships
And the lightlight on the top of the hill.
My fatherland is the hand of the beggar in the bright morning.
There are the marred storms
And the marine cemiteries where my tuberculous and employed ancestors do not stop crying and shake in the cold night
And the smell of sugar in the port warehouses
And the bells through in the nets of the fingers
And the onions started in the dark
And the rain that falls on the curries of fish.
The word I use is not and it was never my homeland.
No deceived ling is the fatherland.
it's just for me to say my big and poor fatherland changes,
My fatherland, disinteric and deceived, without grammars and without words,
My fatherland without words and without words."

mes vacances: gostei muito das férias
je suis allée à la plage (com dois ee,

no mar e ia ver gaivotas ao dicionário
as correcções a vermelho e o passé simple,
escrever cem vezes nous fûmes vous fûtes ils fûrent
as tardes de sol
e madame denise que dizia toi ma petite
com ar de sargento e a cara zangada a fazer-se
vermelha (tenho glóbulos a mais, faites attention)
e o olhar que desmentia tudo
em ternura remplit
e as regras decoradas e as terminações
verbais ais, ais, ait,
a hora de estudo extra e o sol de fim de tarde
a filtrar-se pelas carteiras,
a freira a vigiar distraída em salmos

incógnita

ser boa, não era o santinho nem o rebuçado
era a palavra doce a afagar-me por dentro,
as batas todas brancas salpicdas de gouache
colorido e o cinto azul que eu trazia sempre largo
assim a cair de lado à espadachim
as escadas de madeira rangentes
ao compasso dos passos, sentidas ainda
à distância de vinte anos,
todas nós em submissa fila a responder à chamada,
""presente"" parecia-me então lógico e certo
como assistir à oração na capela e ler as epístolas
(de são paulo aos coríntios:
naquele tempo...),
tem uma voz bonita e lê tão bem, e depois
mandavam-me apertar o cinto para ficar
mais composta em cima do banquinho,
à direita do padre
e o fascínio das confissões,
as vozes sussuradas na fina madeira
castanha a esconder uma falta,
o cheiro do chão encerrado e da cera das velas
e quando deixei de acreditar em pecados
e comecei a achar que as palavras não prestam
e que era inútil
inútil a teia de madeira
ah noites de insónia à distância de vinte anos,
once upon a time there was a little boy
and he went up on journey

ah… old copybook
where i wrote out my french themes,
mes vacances: i adored holidays
je suis allée à la plage (with two e’s,
the verb être asking to agree), j’ai beaucoup
nagé and then i’d end with the sunset
over the sea, looking up ‘gulls’ in the dictionary
corrections in red and the passé simple,
writing nous fûmes vous fûtes ils fûrent a hundred times
during sunny afternoons
and madame denise who said toi ma petite
like a drill sergeant her face turning angry
and red (i have too many globules! faites attention)
and that look which contradicted it all
with remplit tenderness
and the rules memorized and the verb
endings ais, ais, ait
during extra help and the falling afternoon light
pooling beneath the desks,
our nun lost in her psalms
me dreaming over my open book
once upon a time there was a little boy
and the algebraic equations
with x as unknown
ah… beautiful afternoons when it was good
to be good, and neither the little saint nor candy,
but the sweet word fondling me from within,
our white smocks spotted with bright hued gouache
the blue belt i always wore draped
like a swashbuckler
creaking wooden stairs
rhyming to steps
twenty years on,
falling into formation to the roll,
“present” seemed so logical and certain then,
like going to prayers in the chapel and reading the epistles
(saint paul to the corinthians:
in that time…),
you have such a beautiful voice and read so well,
and then they made me tighten my belt,
primped in my pew
to the right of the priest
the pull of the confession,
voices murmuring through the fine wooden web
dissembling defects,
smell of the waxed floor and the wax of the candles
and when i stopped believing in sin,
knew words didn’t do any good,
that the wooden web
was useless
ah… nights of insomnia twenty years on

and he went on a journey
there was a little girl, une petite fille

sempre estive à sua espera.
quando menino, li recordações da casa dos mortos
e vi a neve caindo na estepe siberiana
e no casaco roto de fédor dostoievski.
amo a neve porque ela não separa o dia da noite
nem afasta o céu das aflições da terra.
une o que está separado:
os passos dos homens condenados ao gelo escurecido
e os suspiros de amor que se perdem no ar.
é necessário ter um ouvido muito afiado
para ouvir a música da neve caindo, algo quase silencioso
como o roçar da asa de um anjo, caso os anjos existissem,
ou o estertor de um pássaro.
não se deve esperar a neve como se espera o amor.
são coisas diferentes. basta abrirmos os olhos para ver a neve
cair no campo desolado. e ela cai em nós, a neve branca e fria
que não queima como o fogo do amor.
para ver o amor os nossos olhos não bastam,
nem os ouvidos, nem a boca, nem mesmo os nossos corações
que batem na escuridão com o mesmo rumor
da neve caindo nas estepes
e nos telhados das cabanas escuras

o afastam de nós, de nossos braços abertos

it unites what’s separate:
the footsteps of those condemned to darkened ice
and sighs of love vanishing in the air.

to hear the music of falling snow, something almost silent
like the touch of an angel’s wing, assuming there are angels,
or the dying breath of a bird.

falling on a deserted field. and it falls on us, cold white snow
that doesn’t burn like the flame of love.

keep it from us, from our open arms

my hades
with its flashing little goats
grazing
in the valley of the shadow of death.
and now the question is: who’s gonna drive you home tonight?

keeps distilling some other questions, but none

to rise inside narrow tubes
unlike quicksilver?

in your absence.",pt_XX,en_XX,"It's possible in another time, in another circumstances

Every time you surfaced (just
I didn't tell you anything) pleiates lighting
My hades

And the question today is: whos gonna drive you home tonoight?

feito os telefonemas, escolhido os dizeres.

a brief and affable sorrow
surfacing in the eyes, a distant disappointment,
you died as if gently begging pardon
for making us lose time.
you were in a rush but didn’t show it,
you feared that we were not prepared,
and, hovering above us, you waited
for us to say it all, and do what needed to be done.
dying is no reason to be proud,
but you were too exhausted to explain yourself.
and worst of all, it was july,
vacations set, relatives already gone.

made our phone calls, chosen our words.

"o sentimento dum ocidental
i
ave-marias
nas nossas ruas, ao anoitecer,
há tal soturnidade, há tal melancolia,
que as sombras, o bulício, o tejo, a maresia
despertam-me um desejo absurdo de sofrer.
o céu parece baixo e de neblina,
o gás extravasado enjoa-me, perturba;
e os edifícios, com as chaminés, e a turba
toldam-se duma cor monótona e londrina.
batem carros de aluguer, ao fundo,
levando à via-férrea os que se vão. felizes!
ocorrem-me em revista exposições, países:
madrid, paris, berlim, s. petersburgo, o mundo!
semelham-se a gaiolas, com viveiros,
as edificações somente emadeiradas:
como morcegos, ao cair das badaladas,
saltam de viga em viga os mestres carpinteiros.
voltam os calafates, aos magotes,
de jaquetão ao ombro, enfarruscados, secos;
embrenho-me, a cismar, por boqueirões, por becos,
ou erro pelos cais a que se atracam botes.
e evoco, então, as crónicas navais:
mouros, baixéis, heróis, tudo ressuscitado!
luta camões no sul, salvando um livro a nado!
singram soberbas naus que eu não verei jamais!
e o fim da tarde inspira-me; e incomoda!
de um couraçado inglês vogam os escaleres;
e em terra num tinir de louças e talheres
flamejam, ao jantar alguns hotéis da moda.
num trem de praça arengam dois dentistas;
um trôpego arlequim braceja numas andas;
os querubins do lar flutuam nas varandas;
às portas, em cabelo, enfadam-se os lojistas!
vazam-se os arsenais e as oficinas;
reluz, viscoso, o rio, apressam-se as obreiras;
e num cardume negro, hercúleas, galhofeiras,
correndo com firmeza, assomam as varinas.
vêm sacudindo as ancas opulentas!
seus troncos varonis recordam-me pilastras;
e algumas, à cabeça, embalam nas canastras
os filhos que depois naufragam nas tormentas.
descalças! nas descargas de carvão,
desde manhã à noite, a bordo das fragatas;
e apinham-se num bairro aonde miam gatas,
e o peixe podre gera os focos de infecção!
ii
noite fechada
toca-se às grades, nas cadeias. som
que mortifica e deixa umas loucuras mansas!
o aljube, em que hoje estão velhinhas e crianças,
bem raramente encerra uma mulher de “dom”!
e eu desconfio, até, de um aneurisma
tão mórbido me sinto, ao acender das luzes;
à vista das prisões, da velha sé, das cruzes,
chora-me o coração que se enche e que se abisma.
a espaços, iluminam-se os andares,
e as tascas, os cafés, as tendas, os estancos
alastram em lençol os seus reflexos brancos;
e a lua lembra o circo e os jogos malabares.
duas igrejas, num saudoso largo,
lançam a nódoa negra e fúnebre do clero:
nelas esfumo um ermo inquisidor severo,
assim que pela história eu me aventuro e alargo.
na parte que abateu no terremoto,
muram-me as construções rectas, iguais, crescidas;
afrontam-me, no resto, as íngremes subidas,
e os sinos dum tanger monástico e devoto.
mas, num recinto público e vulgar,
com bancos de namoro e exíguas pimenteiras,
brônzeo, monumental, de proporções guerreiras,
um épico doutrora ascende, num pilar!
e eu sonho o cólera, imagino a febre,
nesta acumulação de corpos enfezados;
sombrios e espectrais recolhem os soldados;
inflama-se um palácio em face de um casebre.
partem patrulhas de cavalaria
dos arcos dos quartéis que foram já conventos;
idade média! a pé, outras, a passos lentos,
derramam-se por toda a capital, que esfria.
triste cidade! eu temo que me avives
uma paixão defunta! aos lampiões distantes,
enlutam-me, alvejando, as tuas elegantes,
curvadas a sorrir às montras dos ourives.
e mais: as costureiras, as floristas
descem dos magasins, causam-me sobressaltos;
custa-lhes a elevar os seus pescoços altos
e muitas delas são comparsas ou coristas.
e eu, de luneta de uma lente só,
eu acho sempre assunto a quadros revoltados:
entro na brasserie; às mesas de emigrados,
ao riso e à crua luz joga-se o dominó.
iii
ao gás
e saio. a noite pesa, esmaga. nos
passeios de lajedo arrastam-se as impuras.
ó moles hospitais! sai das embocaduras
um sopro que arripia os ombros quase nus.
cercam-me as lojas, tépidas. eu penso
ver círios laterais, ver filas de capelas,
com santos e fiéis, andores, ramos, velas,
em uma catedral de um comprimento imenso.
as burguesinhas do catolicismo
resvalam pelo chão minado pelos canos;
e lembram-me, ao chorar doente dos pianos,
as freiras que os jejuns matavam de histerismo.
num cutileiro, de avental, ao torno,
um forjador maneja um malho, rubramente;
e de uma padaria exala-se, inda quente,
um cheiro salutar e honesto a pão no forno.
e eu que medito um livro que exacerbe,
quisera que o real e a análise mo dessem;
casas de confecções e modas resplandecem;
pelas vitrines olha um ratoneiro imberbe.
longas descidas! não poder pintar
com versos magistrais, salubres e sinceros,
a esguia difusão dos vossos reverberos,
e a vossa palidez romântica e lunar!
que grande cobra, a lúbrica pessoa,
que espartilhada escolhe uns xales com debuxo!
sua excelência atrai, magnética, entre luxo,
que ao longo dos balcões de mogno se amontoa.
e aquela velha, de bandós! por vezes,
a sua traîne imita um leque antigo, aberto,
nas barras verticais, a duas tintas. perto,
escarvam, à vitória, os seus mecklemburgueses.
desdobram-se tecidos estrangeiros;
plantas ornamentais secam nos mostradores;
flocos de pós de arroz pairam sufocadores,
e em nuvens de cetins requebram-se os caixeiros.
mas tudo cansa! apagam-se nas frentes
os candelabros, como estrelas, pouco a pouco;
da solidão regouga um cauteleiro rouco;
tornam-se mausoléus as armações fulgentes.
“dó da miséria!... compaixão de mim!...”
e, nas esquinas, calvo, eterno, sem repouso,
pede-me esmola um homenzinho idoso,
meu velho professor nas aulas de latim!
iv
horas mortas
o tecto fundo de oxigénio, de ar,
estende-se ao comprido, ao meio das trapeiras;
vêm lágrimas de luz dos astros com olheiras,
enleva-me a quimera azul de transmigrar.
por baixo, que portões! que arruamentos!
um parafuso cai nas lajes, às escuras:
colocam-se taipais, rangem as fechaduras,
e os olhos dum caleche espantam-me, sangrentos.
e eu sigo, como as linhas de uma pauta
a dupla correnteza augusta das fachadas;
pois sobem, no silêncio, infaustas e trinadas,
as notas pastoris de uma longínqua flauta.
se eu não morresse, nunca! e eternamente
buscasse e conseguisse a perfeição das cousas!
esqueço-me a prever castíssimas esposas,
que aninhem em mansões de vidro transparente!
ó nossos filhos! que de sonhos ágeis,
pousando, vos trarão a nitidez às vidas!
eu quero as vossas mães e irmãs estremecidas,
numas habitações translúcidas e frágeis.
ah! como a raça ruiva do porvir,
e as frotas dos avós, e os nómadas ardentes,
nós vamos explorar todos os continentes
e pelas vastidões aquáticas seguir!
mas se vivemos, os emparedados,
sem árvores, no vale escuro das muralhas!...
julgo avistar, na treva, as folhas das navalhas
e os gritos de socorro ouvir estrangulados.
e nestes nebulosos corredores
nauseiam-me, surgindo, os ventres das tabernas;
na volta, com saudade, e aos bordos sobre as pernas,
cantam, de braço dado, uns tristes bebedores.
eu não receio, todavia, os roubos;
afastam-se, a distância, os dúbios caminhantes;
e sujos, sem ladrar, ósseos, febris, errantes,
amareladamente, os cães parecem lobos.
e os guardas, que revistam as escadas,
caminham de lanterna e servem de chaveiros;
por cima, as imorais, nos seus roupões ligeiros,
tossem, fumando sobre a pedra das sacadas.
e, enorme, nesta massa irregular
de prédios sepulcrais, com dimensões de montes,
a dor humana busca os amplos horizontes,
e tem marés, de fel, como um sinistro mar!","the feeling of a westerner
i
vespers
when evening falls across our streets
and sullen melancholy fills the air,
the tagus, the tang, the shadows and bustle
bring me an absurd desire to suffer.
the sky hangs low and seems all hazy;
the gas from the streetlamps makes me queasy;
the tumult of buildings, chimneys and people
is cloaked in a dullish, londonish hue.
oh lucky travellers in hired coaches
now hieing to the railway station! countries
and exhibitions file past me: madrid,
paris, berlin, st petersburg, the world!
the timber frames of future buildings
resemble cages for keeping animals;
like swooping bats the carpenters leap
from beam to beam at the sound of the bell.
clusters of callous, tar-smeared caulkers
return from the slipways, coats on their shoulders;
i wander through alleys that lead to the river
or walk by the wharves where boats are docked.
i evoke the ocean chronicles: the moors,
old vessels and heroes – all resurrected!
shipwrecked camões swims his book to shore! (1)
great carracks that i’ll never see ride the waves!
the twilight inspires, and also disturbs me!
an english battleship launches its cutters
while swank hotels on land bedazzle
with china and flatware clinking at dinner.
two dentists argue inside a streetcar;
a clumsy clown is struggling on stilts;
children flit, like cherubs, on balconies;
hatless, bored shopkeepers wait at their doors!
the shipyards and workshops are emptying out;
the river glints thickly, the workwomen hurry;
and a black school of herculean fishwives
bursts out of nowhere, joking, laughing.
wagging sumptuous hips they come!
their manly torsos remind me of pillars;
and some, in the baskets on their heads,
rock sons who’ll one day drown in storms.
on frigates – barefoot! – they unload coal (2)
from dawn to dusk, then crowd together
in a neighbourhood where cats meow
and the rotting fish breed infection!
ii
after dark
prisoners bang on the bars of their cells –
a sound that rattles my nerves with shame!
the aljube jail, for old women and children,
rarely encloses a titled lady!
i feel so ill as the lights come on
i worry i might have an aneurysm;
the sight of the jails, crosses, cathedral,
fills and sinks my heart with tears.
one floor after another lights up,
and cafés, restaurants, tobacco and other shops
spread like a sheet their white reflections.
the moon brings jugglers, the circus, to mind.
on an ancient square two churches raise
the clergy’s black, funereal spectre;
i sketch there a lonely, dour inquisitor,
daring to extend myself into history.
in quarters which the earthquake flattened
equal, straight buildings wall me in; (3)
everywhere else i face steep streets
and the tolling of pious, monastic bells.
but gracing a common, public square
with lovers’ benches and lithe pepper trees
a war-sized monument cast in bronze
stands, on a pillar, for an epic that was! (4)
and in this assemblage of stunted bodies
i think of the fever, imagine the cholera;
returning soldiers look sombre as ghosts;
a gleaming palace stands opposite a hovel.
mounted patrolmen set out from the archways
of army barracks that once were convents;
the middle ages! others, on foot,
range through the capital, now turning cold.
sad town! i dread you’ll arouse a dead passion
in me! i mourn upon seeing your elegant
ladies so white in the lamp-lit distance,
leaning and smiling at jewellers’ windows.
coming down from the department stores,
the florists and dressmakers wrench my gut;
they’re hardly able to hold up their heads,
and many are walk-ons and chorus girls.
even in sordid human tableaus
i, with my pince-nez, find subject matter:
i enter the beerhouse; at the immigrants’ tables,
harshly lit, they laugh and play dominoes.
iii
by gaslight
and i go back out. the night’s weight crushes.
impure women roam the sidewalks.
o languid hospitals! ill-clad shoulders
shiver from drafts where streets open up.
warm shops surround me. i think i’m seeing
flanking candles, rows of chapels
with saints and the faithful, flowers, more candles,
more saints, in a vastly long cathedral.
the bourgeois women of catholicism
slip on the ground that’s tunnelled by drainpipes.
to me they recall, with their whining pianos,
the nuns who, fasting, died of madness.
an aproned knife maker, working the lathe,
redhotly wields his blacksmith’s hammer;
and bread, still warm, from the baker’s oven
sends forth its honest, wholesome smell.
and i, whose goal is a book that galls,
want it to show and examine what’s real.
boutiques shine with the latest fashions;
a street urchin gapes at their window displays.
o long descents! could i but paint
with skilled, sincere, salubrious verses
the delicate shimmering of your streetlamps
and all your romantic moonlit pallor!
that sensual, corseted creature selecting
printed shawls – she moves like a snake!
her excellence is a magnet amidst
the finery piled on mahogany counters.
and that old dame with coiled plaits!
her train with its vertical, two-tone stripes
mocks a spread fan! her mecklenburg horses
wait with the carriage, pawing the pavement.
decorative plants wilt on the tables
where clerks unroll their foreign fabrics;
in clouds of satins they bow and smile;
rice powder hovers and chokes the air.
but all grows weary! slowly, like stars,
the storefronts’ hanging lights go dim;
the glittering buildings become mausoleums;
a lone, hoarse voice hawks lottery tickets.
and there on a corner: “please, sir! take pity!”
whenever i pass him, that little old man,
bald and eternal, begs for alms:
the teacher at school who taught me latin!
iv
the dead hours
the lofty ceiling of air, of oxygen,
runs between the facing rooftops;
the stars’ tired eyes shed tears of light;
blue dreams of transmigration exalt me.
below all that, what portals! what streets!
i hear, in the dark, a screw hit the ground,
the clacking of shutters, the jangle of locks;
and the bloodshot eyes of a buggy scare me.
i follow, like lines on a music stave,
the stately double row of façades
while pastoral notes from a distant flute
trill, in the silence, a gloomy warning.
oh, if i’d never die! if forever
i’d seek and attain the perfection of things!
i lose myself envisioning wives
who chastely nest in clear-glass mansions!
dear sons! what swift dreams, alighting,
will bring sharp clarity to your lives!
i want the mothers and sisters you love
to live in luminous, fragile homes.
ah! like our grandfathers’ fleets, like fervent
nomads, like the ruddy race to come, (5)
we’ll go and explore every continent
and sail across the watery expanses!
but how, if we live enclosed by stone
in a dark and treeless valley of walls?
i think i see knives flash in the shadows
and hear a strangled cry for help.
and along these murky corridors
the taverns, if i peer in, appall me.
some sorry drunks are staggering home
and sing, arms joined, for old time’s sake.
but i’m not afraid of being robbed;
the dubious characters fall behind me.
the scrawny and mangy dogs don’t bark;
they look a little like yellowish wolves.
and those keepers of keys, the night watchmen,
scan with their lanterns each entryway;
above them loose women, in scanty robes,
smoke and cough at the balcony windows.
and looming out of that jagged mass
of tomblike buildings tall as hills,

On our streets, in the night,
There's this soturnity, there's this melancholy,
That the shadows, the bulice, the tijo, the sea
They woke me an absurd desire to suffer.
The sky seems down and in a mist,
The extravased gas is tired of me, troubles me;
And the builths, with the firsts, and the turba
Them uphold in a monotone and londrina color.

On a square train, there are two dentistas;
It's an arlequin struggle in a walk;
The cherubs of the home float on the masts;
At the door, in hair, the lookers are enraged!
The arsenals and the workshops are pouring in;
Shine, viscous, the river, the storms hurt;
And in a black shoal, hercules, galhofeiras,
Running with strengthness, the worries smoke.
The opulent hips are rocking!
Their male storms remember me pilastras;
And something, to the head, wrap in the canestras
The children that wrong in the dusts.

And the bells of a monastic and devout tanger.
But, in a public and vulgar place,
With dates and little pimentary banks,
Bronzeum, monumental, of warrial proportions,
An epic of others up, in a pilear!
And I dream the cholera, I imagine the fever,
In this accumulation of empty bodies;
dark and spectral get the strengths;
A palácio is inflamed in front of a house.

Them are pouring in all the capital, that colds.
Sad city! I'm afraid you'll turn me on
It's a defunct passion! To the different limpions,
They hurt me, smalling, your sleek,
Curved smiling to the monsters of the ourives.
And more: the costumers, the flowers
They go down from the shops, they cause me to bring;
It costs them to elevate their high knows
And so many of them are partys or coristas.
And me, on a goggle of a look,
I always think a subjeature to revolted pictures:
I go into the brasserie; to the tables of emigrants,
To the laught and the black light plays the domino.

And from a bakery, it exhales, it's still hot,

The houses of confections and fades shine;
Through the windows, he looks a window rattonier.

Floaks of rise leaves see suffocates,

From loneliness, a hussy hussy chick;
The mausoleums turn into the fulling arms.

A pin falls in the lajes, in the dark:
Taipals are placed, the latchs are placed,
And the eyes of a bedroom scar me, blood.
And I follow, like the line of a book
The double august corrence of the fronts;
For they go up in silence, infausted and trined,

But if we live, the wallets,
Without trees, in the dark vale of the walls!...
I think to see, in the dark, the leafs of the knives
And the screams of relief hear strangulate.
And in this nebule halls
The twonts of the twonts was naused me, and the twonts of the twonts was naused;
On the round, with longing, and on the side on the legs,
They sing, with a give arm, sad drinkers.
I'm not afraid, always, of the hives;
Away, the distance, the walking doubles;
And dirty, without slattering, bony, febrile, wandering,
Yet, the dogs like wolves.
And the guards, that look the streets,
They walk with a lantern and serve as keyboards;
On top, the immorals, in their slight robes,
Cry, smoking about the rock of the drapes.
And, hugely, in this erring whole
of sepulcral builds, with dimensions of mountains,
Human pain searches for the expansive horizons,
And there are ties, in feel, like a single sea!"

"atropelamento e fuga
era preciso mais do que silêncio,
era preciso pelo menos uma grande gritaria,
uma crise de nervos, um incêndio,
portas a bater, correrias.

perguntaste-me as horas, eram 3 da tarde,

um dia que começara mal, tinha deixado
as chaves na fechadura do lado de dentro da porta,

estivesses morta!), olhando-me em silêncio estendida no asfalto,

a day that had begun badly, i had left
the keys in the lock on the inside of the door,

Doors throughing, runnings.
But you've been silenced,
I wanted you to cry but the first you had to find your hair,
You asked me the times, it was 3 a.m.

You were dead!), looking me in silence expansed in the asphal,

quem quer que lhe tivesse concebido os ossos, era então visível o objectivo de os fazer florir. deles brotaria a pele, o céu, a encenação da glória. tudo isso mais não eram, entretanto, do que imagens em apuros, imagens atacadas por memórias em conflito com o presente, ou mesmo com o passado onde pareciam radicar, e que, esbeiçando-se nos bordos, davam lugar a que o esquecimento sobre elas actuasse como uma espécie de ácido sulfúrico.
de cada vez que o invadia, a enxurrada da memória ascendia-lhe assim a um tal nível da consciência que os seus próprios ossos, deixando de ser pontos fixos e estáveis aos quais ele se pudesse segurar, vinham, desmantelados, boiar à superfície das águas borrascosas, de mistura

each time it rushed in on him, the torrent of memories rose to such a height of consciousness that his very bones ceased being fixed and stable points he could hold on to. dismantled, they ended up floating on the surface of the stormy waters, mixed up among his innards, with only his heart still apparently in place, as if inflating and keeping his other parts afloat among the grease and tumult of remembrances.",pt_XX,en_XX,"- You're smoking.

aproveitando a sombra débil e ambulante.
sentado na boleia, as rédeas na mão morena
descuidadas, um homem cisma, confia
do caminho ao macho lento a decisão.
outros homens a pé e mulheres novas
entretêm de riso a caminhada espessa.
logo após, sobre os burros, os pertences.

tiram partido do precário trote. as crianças

de alguma enfermidade menos limpa
e neles cravam dentes de fome milenária.
dizem que as mulheres estão na intimidade
das estrelas e a troco de uns mil-réis
lêem nas mãos destinos coloridos.
dizem que roubam quintais e assaltam capoeiras,
e os aldeões, em pânico secreto,
os expulsam com voz impiedosa e decidida mão
das cercanias do seu chão governado.

em negócios sempre escuros de animais,
em que fazem passar por uma estampa

têm por costume, depois de embriagados,
trocar com as bengalas possantes e vistosas
pancadaria rija, de que morrem.

para falarmos do meio de obter o poema,
a retórica não serve. trata-se de uma coisa simples, que não
precisa de requintes nem de fórmulas. apanha-se
uma flor, por exemplo, mas que não seja dessas flores que crescem
no meio do campo, nem das que se vendem nas lojas
ou nos mercados. é uma flor de sílabas, em que as
pétalas são as vogais, e o caule uma consoante. põe-se
no jarro da estrofe, e deixa-se estar. para que não morra,
basta um pedaço de primavera na água, que se vai
buscar à imaginação, quando está um dia de chuva,
ou se faz entrar pela janela, quando o ar fresco
da manhã enche o quarto de azul. então,
a flor confunde-se com o poema, mas ainda não é
o poema. para que ele nasça, a flor precisa
de encontrar cores mais naturais do que essas
que a natureza lhe deu. podem ser as cores do teu
rosto – a sua brancura, quando o sol vem ter contigo,
ou o fundo dos teus olhos em que todas as cores
da vida se confundem, com o brilho da vida. depois,
deito essas cores sobre a corola, e vejo-as descerem
para as folhas, como a seiva que corre pelos
veios invisíveis da alma. posso, então, colher a flor,

me deste.","how to make a poem
if we’re going to talk about how to make a poem,
rhetoric has nothing to do with it. it’s simpler than that, and doesn’t
require subtleties or formulas. pick
a flower, for example, but not one of those flowers that grow
in the middle of fields, nor the ones they sell in stores,
or in the markets. a flower of syllables rather, in which the
petals are vowels, and the stem is the consonant. place it
in the vase of the stanza, and let it be. so that it doesn’t die,
it’s enough to put a little spring in the water, which,
on a rainy day, is fetched from the imagination,
or is pushed in through the window when the cool air
of morning fills the blue room. this is when
the flower begins to seem like a poem, but it’s still not
the poem. for it to really sprout, the flower needs
to find more natural colors than those
which nature gave it. they might be the colors
of your complexion – its whiteness, when the sun falls on you,
or the depths of your eyes in which all the colors
of life mix with the sheen of life. after that,
i pour these colors over the corolla, and watch them descend
to the leaves, like sap which runs through
the invisible veins of the soul. i can then pick the flower,
and what i have in my hand is this poem
that you gave me.",pt_XX,en_XX,"how to do the poem

"ladrões de bicicletas - vittorio de sica (1948)
mil quilómetros por dia pedalava meu pai, desde
a cama junto ao douro até à próspera cerâmica
de valadares. se qualquer homem recebe,
à nascença, uns sessenta inimigos por hora,
imaginem a jornada de um operário ciclista.
tudo são despesas para ele: o rosário de geada
nas giestas, o jornal atropelado pelo vento, o verdor
da primavera, a poalha do suor em cada mão.
meu pai, é claro, não se queixa, ganha um conto
de réis, tem uma casa portuguesa e grandes sonhos
de amanhãs a gasolina. pelo menos não trabalho
em nenhum matadouro, pensa ele, e com razão,
erguido nos pedais do seu veículo de sombra,
solitário trepador pela encosta de avintes. não
trabalha em nenhum matadouro. e nesse reconforto

sente já o rumor de fumacentos camiões na nacional,

500 miles per day pedaled my father, from his bed
near the douro river to the booming ceramicware
plant of valadares. if all men, from birth,
are given some sixty enemies per hour,
imagine a life cycling to and from a factory.
one effort after another: the rosary of frost covering
clusters of broom, a newspaper battered by the wind,
the greenness of spring, the dusty sweat on each hand.
my father, to be sure, never complains. he earns five
dollars a day and has a small house and big dreams
of gas-powered tomorrows. “at least i don’t work
in a slaughterhouse”, he thinks, and with good reason,
standing tall on the pedals of his shadowy vehicle,
a solitary cyclist climbing the slope at avintes. he doesn’t
work in a slaughterhouse. and with that solace
he rides past the quinta dos frades, reaches freixieiro,
and hears the rumble of the smoky trucks on the highway,
where the ride, at last, will be much smoother.",pt_XX,en_XX,"Bicyclist througs - victory of sica (1948)
A thousand miles a day, my father walked, from
The bed by the dark towards the prospering of ceramics
If a man doesn't walk,
At nance, after 60 enemys per hour,
Imagine the travel of a cyclist worker.
Everything is expensive to him: the rosary of geats
In the geests, the day beat by the wind, the verdor
from the spring, the sweat's fool in every hand.
My father, of course, doesn't call, wins a tale
It's a portuguese house and big dreams
from morrows to gas. At least I don't work
In no knowhouse, he thinks, and rightly,
just on the shoes of your shadow car,
Just lonely clipper on the backside of adventures. no
Works in no kitador. And in this comfort
pass to the friends' five, he reachs the flower,
it's already the tell of smokes of lorries in the national,
Wherever everything, then, will be much more plan."

"para agradar a uma sombra
agora que já chorei o meu papel de solitário
posso virar a folha e declarar que, na verdade,
eu nunca estive sozinho. tive sempre a boa companhia
da minha sombra. e não posso dizer
que nos déssemos mal: uns dias pior, outros pior.
como todos os casais. tínhamos (e temos)
a mesma idade, os mesmos gostos musicais,
um amor paralelo por fogo de lenha,
líamos os livros a meias, quase não gastávamos
nenhum oxigénio.
dos dois era ela quem insistia, às vezes,
para irmos dançar. mas eu, é claro, detestava
o tremedal das discotecas; amava mais depressa
o movimento descritivo dos romances
do que a luz hipotecada de um corpo distante.
com o tempo, no entanto, foi crescendo esse litígio.
as nossas relações foram perdendo vulto
à medida que ela convidava mais gente
para a nossa cama. até que um dia chegou a casa
e apresentou-me “o amor da nossa vida; agora
somos três”. e assim a minha sombra,
a minha ingrata começou a dizer coisas lacerantes.
por exemplo: “vai tu ao cinema. nós ficamos.”
ou então: “bem podemos, de vez em quando,
caminhar separados, ou não achas?” e fecha-se
no quarto com a outra, em colóquios ofegantes.
altura em que, de raiva, saio porta fora.
uma vida a três é talvez menos longa do que uma vida
a dois. há um milímetro agora de distância entre mim
e a sombra. o espaço bastante para um raio de luz.
não ficámos, realmente, pior do que estávamos.
mas chega a ser enjoativo ver o trevo cor-de-rosa
que semeiam no quintal, felizes como duas estrelinhas
de cinema. nem sei o que diga. parecem crianças.","to please a shadow
now that i’ve wept my part as a lonely man,
i can turn the script over and declare that, in fact,
i’ve never been alone. i’ve always had the good company
of my shadow. and i have to say
we’ve done all right together, with bad days and worse days,
like all couples. we were (and are) the same
age, with the same musical tastes
and a parallel fondness for sitting by the fire,
reading the same books, using almost
no oxygen.
she was the one who sometimes insisted
we go dancing, whereas i naturally hated
the scuzziness of discotheques, preferring
the descriptive movement of novels
to the mortgaged light of a distant body.
the tension between us increased over time,
with things going downhill when she started
inviting other people into our bed. until
one day she arrived home and introduced me to
“the love of our life; now we’re a threesome”.
and so my shadow, that ingrate,
began saying the most atrocious things.
such as: “you go to the movies. we’re staying home.”
or: “we could walk separately now and then,
don’t you think?” and she shuts herself up in the bedroom
for impassioned (breathless) conversations with the other.
at which point i leave the house in a huff.
a life shared by three is perhaps shorter than one
shared by two. now there’s a millimeter of distance between me
and my shadow. enough of an interval for a ray of light.
we’re not really any worse off than before.

they sow in the backyard, happy as two little
movie stars. what can i say? they’re like children.",pt_XX,en_XX,"To enjoy a shadow

just like all the couples. We have (and we have)
the same age, the same musical tastes,
A parallel love by fire of firewood,
We'd like the books in socks, we'd almost not expend
No oxygen.
it was her who insisted, sometimes,
To go dance. But I, of course, destroyed
The tremordal of discotheques; I loved more faster
the descriptive movement of romances
than the hypothected light of a far-off body.
In time, however, this bittering was growing.
our relationship was losing a lot
As she invited more people
to our bed. Until one day arrived home
And introduced me to the love of our life; now
we're three. And so my shadow,
My ingrate started to say lacerant things.
For example: You go to the cinema. We stay.
Or so: well we can, from time to time,
To walk separately, or don't you think? And closes
In the room with the other, in offering colloquies.
it's a time when, in fury, I leave the door out.
A three-way life is maybe lest long than a life
On two. There's a mm now a distance from me
And the shadow. the space too much for a ray of light.
We won't, really, better than we were.
But it comes to be empty to see the rose-colored dark
that sow in the garden, happy like two stars
I don't even know what you say. They like children."

barracão perto da cidade gótica.

conhecia-o do fandango,
e sabia apenas que uma tristeza sem lágrimas
lhe iluminava as tardes e as noites.

um copo no único pub ainda aberto

ele veio sentar-se ao meu lado, bêbedo

da queda. convidou-me a segui-lo e eu,
não sei bem porquê, acedi. acompanhei-o
até às duas assoalhadas em que morava
– sem vizinhos, numa barraca de alumínio
e tabopan que fazia da palavra desespero
um eufemismo inoportuno. o cão,
pelo menos, gostou de nos ver chegar.
depois chorou, a troco de nada. queria apenas
um ombro concreto onde pousar a cabeça
que a mulher e as filhas já nem por engano
beijavam. não precisava de gestos ou palavras,
bastava-lhe ser ouvido, partilhar o impartilhável
a que talvez chamasse (não me lembro bem) a dor.
adormeceu assim, no meu ombro – e eu estava
capaz de matar (mas não a ele) por uma cerveja,
pelo gin que horas antes encontrara demasiado
cedo o chão. ao amanhecer, abanei-o levemente,
disse-lhe que tinha mesmo de ir. beijou-me
a mão, agradeceu com um sorriso estragado
aquele nada de nada entre dois homens
que nunca mais se voltarão a ver. cá fora,
uma luz amordaçada desaconselhava qualquer
tentação lírica, vinha morrer nas couves,
nos dejectos vários que lhe tornavam menos só a solidão.

i’d met him at the fandango
and knew only that a tearless sadness
lit up his afternoons and evenings.
this time it was different. i’d just broken
a glass in the only still open pub

he came over and sat down, one drunk
facing another, united by the quasi-splendor
of their fall. he invited me to follow him and,
without knowing why, i followed. all the way
to the two rooms in which he lived,
without neighbors – an aluminum and plywood
shack that made the word despair
an inadequate euphemism. the dog,
at least, was glad to see us arrive.
then he cried, over nothing. he merely wanted
a real shoulder where he could lean his head
which his wife and daughters would no longer even kiss
in a dream. he needed no words or gestures,
just an ear to hear him share the unshareable
which perhaps (i don’t quite remember) he called sorrow.
he fell asleep that way, on my shoulder – and i
could have killed (but not him) for a beer
or the gin that, a few hours earlier, dropped too soon
to the floor. in the morning, when i woke up, i gently
shook him and said i really had to go. he kissed
my hand, thanking me with his rotted smile
for that nothing at all between two men
who won’t ever see each other again. outside,
a muffled light advised against any
lyrical attempt, dying among the cabbages
and junk that made his solitude less solitary.

calamitosa dos meus erros.

she arrives, and i’d rather sleep
than watch tv with her

into a poet, when what
i’d really like to be

so rude. she’d do away

crazy! – with frightful swordsmen

sentimental nature.

is crap, she recites

The name of all things:

Acre of worked land,
You see a woman calls you

And call her scared.

If it won't be an idiot.
The truth is that I'm not happy
with her, just a little
More lonely.
But without her – see that
Sadness, what abandons, what."

somebody.

exist. they wrote or didn’t
write books, love letters,
diaries. no matter: they crossed
our paths, sometimes sat
at the same table, and even believed
in the sweet torture of love.
they had real hands when they touched
the pubescent face they were saying farewell to.
a kiss, though it kissed only wrinkles,
was able to make the mornings less cold.
the dead aren’t very good at farewells,
even if they’re precise and sincere
as never before in the moment they descend
into the earth and won’t let us
partake with them a cigarette,
one last drink, a species of destiny.
the dead are frightfully real.
a whole life is insufficient
for us to kill them all, one
by one, as the most basic metaphysical
hygiene would surely recommend.
and yet they give us the necessary strength
to die more and more, to endure
our rented days, these homes not quite fit
to live in. because the truth is that other
people are merely the imperfect dead.
they, like us, are a bit too alive.
but perhaps they’ll one day write
a poem like this (and it might not even be

"pedaços de vinil com lama
devia ser o disco mais ouvido:
a quinta sinfonia, numa gravação
de klemperer. as manhãs
e as tardes auguravam um futuro
melhor, prendados costumes
que depressa perdi. já então olhava
para a taberna da ana,
enchendo a janela do meu quarto.
tinha medo da sombra, do silêncio,
adivinhando em cada passo o monstro
que me habitava. e lia, para não pensar,
desacreditados escritores franceses.
um dia, de tanto o amar,
peguei no disco e quebrei-o
em pequenos pedaços de vinil
– para doerem mais, melhor.
mantive, não sei bem porquê,
a dura capa de cartão,
essa fúnebre alegoria da infância.
e o que sobrou do disco foi parar
ao ribeiro junto à casa dos meus pais.
mais tarde, o ribeiro com hortas
de domingo à volta foi sufocado pelo terror
de um aldeamento, versão provinciana
de condomínio fechado, num mundo
em que são cada vez mais as portas.
beethoven, esse, quase deixou
de me comover, soterrado como as rãs
pelas mãos invisíveis de quem mata.
o que me comove, passado tanto
tempo, é perceber que fiz a esse disco
o mesmo que faço e volto a fazer
aos corpos que julgo amar:
parti-los, muito devagar, para
que doam sempre um pouco mais.","grimy bits of vinyl
it must have been the most-played record:
the fifth symphony, conducted
by klemperer. the mornings
and afternoons promised a better
future, virtuous habits,
which i soon forgot. i was already eyeing
ana’s tavern,
which filled my bedroom window.
i feared the shadows, silence,
feeling in each footstep the monster
inside me. and i read, so as not to think,
discredited french writers.
i loved it so much that one day
i grabbed the record and broke it
to bits – tiny bits of vinyl –
so that they’d hurt even more.
i’m not sure why, but i kept
the stiff cardboard jacket,
that lugubrious allegory of childhood.
and the remains of the record ended up
in the stream next to my parents’ house.
later on the stream, flanked by weekend
vegetable patches, was strangled by an implacable
housing development, the provincial version
of a gated condominium, in a world
with ever more doors.
as for beethoven, buried like the frogs
by invisible killing hands,
he almost ceased to move me.
what moves me now, years
later, is to realize i did to that record
the same thing i do over and over
to the bodies i think i love:

they’ll keep on hurting a little more.",pt_XX,en_XX,"it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it

his small and humble fantasy
in anything greater than simply leading
his cattle to drink from the cold spring
and drawing their milk so that he can drink!
however fortune may stir things up,
he’ll never feel any greater grief
than the weight of knowing his life is brief.
he’ll see the rising sun’s red face
and see the clear spring always flowing,
not wondering where the water comes from
nor who on the horizon hides the light.

he’ll know the grass that covers the hill;
in god he’ll simply and calmly believe,
not pondering truths he can’t conceive.
among the things of antiquity,
it’s written of a certain thrasyllus
that, due to a grave infirmity,
he lost his senses for a long season,
during which time, bereft of reason,
he claimed and believed that all the ships
which at the port of piraeus landed
were ships he owned if not commanded.
he took himself for a mighty lord
and enjoyed as well a happy life,
since he lost nothing when ships were lost,
and rejoiced for those that landed safely.
time went by till one day crito
his brother returned after a long absence
and, seeing how thrasyllus had lost his wits,
was moved by fraternal love to pity.
he gave him to doctors, charging them
to perform the cure thus far refused.
alas! by restoring his brother’s senses,
he robbed him of his sweet easy life!
the herbs of apollo, without delay,
gave him back his former health.
now of sound mind, thrasyllus thanked
his brother for caring, not for his act.
for when he saw himself in danger
of the toils that sanity would impose
and saw no more that state of privilege
conferred on him by his fantasy,
he sighed: “o enemy brother, pretended
friend, why did you take from me
that life so calm and free of pains,
which can’t be had by anyone sane?
“what king, or duke or mighty lord
would i have wished to trade places with?
what did i care if the world ended
or if nature’s order suddenly changed?

Or that the order changed nature?

Makes me my state, for I'll tell you

três sonatas para piano; e dois concertos para piano e orquestra,
uma “berceuse”, uma barcarola, uma fantasia, uma tarantela, etc.,

um talento de concertista; muitos sucessos mundanos; uma paixão infeliz;
uma ligação célebre com mulher ilustre; outras ligações sortidas;
uma pátria sem fronteiras seguras nem independência concreta;
a europa francesa do romantismo; várias amizades com homens eminentes;
e apenas trinta e nove anos de vida. outros viveram menos, escreveram mais,
comeram mais amargo o classicamente amargo pão do exílio, foram ignorados
ou combatidos, morreram abandonados, não se passearam nas alcovas
ou nos salões da glória, confinaram-se menos ao instrumento que melhor dominavam,
e mesmo foram mais apátridas sofrendo de uma pátria que não haja.
além disso, quase todos escaparam mais à possibilidade repelente
de ser melodia das virgens, ritmo dos castrados,
requebro de meia-tijela, nostalgia dos analfabetos,
e outras coisas medíocres e mesquinhas da vulgaridade, como ele não. ou de ser
prato de não-resistência para os concertistas que tocam para as pessoas que julgam
que gostam de música mas não gostam. ainda por cima
era um arrivista, um pedante convencido da aristocracia que não tinha,
um reaccionário ansiando por revoluções que libertassem as oligarquias
da polónia, coitadinhas, e outras. e, para cúmulo,
a gente começa a desconfiar de que não era sequer um romântico,
pelo menos da maneira que ele fingiu ser e deixou entender que era.
uma arte de compor a música como quem escreve um poema,
a força que se disfarça em languidez, um ar de inspiração
ocultando a estrutura, uma melancolia harmónica por sobre
a ironia melódica (ou o contrário), a magia dos ritmos
usada para esconder o pensamento – e escondê-lo tanto,
que ainda passa por burro de génio este homem que tinha o pensamento nos dedos,
e cuja audácia usava a máscara do sentimento ou das formas livres
para criar-se a si mesmo. tão hábil na sua cozinha, que pode servir-se
morno, às horas da saudade e da amargura,
quente, nas grandes ocasiões da vida triunfal,
e frio, quando só a música dirá o desespero vácuo
de ser-se piano e nada mais no mundo.","chopin: an inventory
almost sixty mazurkas; about thirty etudes;
two dozen preludes; a score of nocturnes;
some fifteen waltzes; over a dozen polonaises;
scherzos, improvisations, ballades, four of each;
three sonatas for piano; and two concertos for piano and orchestra,
one berceuse, one barcalole, one fantasy, one tarantella, etc.,
besides some seventeen songs for voice and piano; a fatal case of tuberculosis;
a talent for concertizing; many mundane successes; an unhappy passion;
a celebrated liaison with a famous woman; other assorted liaisons;
a country without sure borders or definite independence;
the french europe of romanticism; several friendships with the eminent;
and scarcely thirty-nine years of life. others lived less, wrote more,
tasted more bitterly the classically bitter bread of exile, were ignored
or persecuted, died forsaken, didn’t linger in alcoves
or salons of glory, confined themselves less to the instrument they had mastered most,
and were exiled longer in suffering for a non-existent country.
besides, almost all the others escaped the repugnant possibility
of becoming a melody for virgins, a rhythm for the castrated,
a sham, a languishing, a nostalgia of illiterates,
and other vulgar, mediocre, and ungenerous things – as he did not. or of becoming
a piece de non-résistance for performers who play for those who believe
they like music but really don’t. and what’s more,
he was a parvenu, a pedant sure of an aristocracy he couldn’t claim,
a reactionary anguished over revolutions that would liberate, among others,
the oligarchies of poland – poor things. and, finally,
one begins to suspect he was not even a romantic,
at least not in the sense he pretended or let others believe he was.
a knack for composing music as one writes a poem,
a power disguising itself in languor, an air of inspiration
concealing the structure, a harmonious melancholy above
an ironic melody (or the other way round), the magic of rhythms
used to hide thought – and hide it so well
that he still passes for an ass of a genius, this man who had thought in his fingers,
whose boldness put on the mask of feeling and free forms
to create a self. so able in the kitchen, that he can be served
lukewarm, in hours of longing and sorrow,
hot, at those great occasions of triumphant life,
or cold, when music alone expresses the empty despair of being
nothing more in the world than a piano.",pt_XX,en_XX,"Chopin: an inventory

A talent as a concertista; many mondani suces; an unhappy passion;
a fame link with an ilustrious woman; other connections surrendered;
a fatherland with no sure fronts or actual indépendence;
The French europe of romanism; a lot of friendship with eminent men;
And only thirty-nine years of life. others lived less, writed more,
They eat more sour the classicly sour exile's blood, they were ignored
or fighted, they died abandoned, they died, they didn't walk in the alcoves
Or in the halls of glory, they enjoyed learly to the instrument that bettered by they,
And even they were more stateless suffering from a fatherland that doesn't exist.
Beyond this, almost everyone eluded more to the repellent power
of being the melody of the Virgins, the beat of the darklings,
I'm cold of half-tijela, nottalgia of the analphabets,
And other things mediocre and little of vulgarity, like he doesn't. or being
A non-resistance plate for concertistas that play for people that think
that like music but doesn't like still above it

A reactionary looking for revolutions that freed oligarchies
from polony, poorish, and others. And, to the clums,
We stay to be unsuspected that it wasn't even a romantic,
At least in the way he pretend to be and left to understand he was.
An art of coming music like who writes a poem,
The strength that makes hisse in languidity, an air of inspirence
Hiding the structure, a Harmonic melancholy above
The melodic irony (or the converse), the magic of the rhythms
used to hide the thought – and hide it so much,
That still goes by as an ass of genie this man who had the thought on my fingers,
And which audacy used the masquerade of feeling or free form
to create yourself. so skilful in your kitchen, that it can serve
It's morning, in the hours of longing and sourness,
warm, on the great occasions of trional life,
it's cold, when it's only the song will say the empty desperation
of being a piano and nothing else in the world."

every large hope is a grand illusion.
i chase some good that can’t be had:
when halfway there, i’ve lost the trail;
falling a thousand times, i despair.

i look up to see if it’s still there,
it’s lost from sight and lost from hope.",pt_XX,en_XX,"Oh, it's like you elong me, from year to year,
My tired pilgrim!

I've been lost a medic, that I've already had;

Any great hope is a great mistake.
I run after this well that doesn't come;
In the middle of the path dies me,
A thousand times I fall, and I lose my faith.
When he runs, I late; and in the late,
If the eyes ever see it seems,
from the view if you lose me and from the hope."

once, while walking in the country around oxford,
i saw up ahead, beyond a bend in the road,
a church steeple towering above the houses of a hamlet or village.
the photographic image of that non-event has remained with me
like a horizontal wrinkle marring a trouser’s crease.
today it seems relevant...
from the road i associated that steeple with spirituality,
the faith of all ages, and practical charity.

I made a snooze in the cold like a vat that went away.
The gods that exist are surrounded by the square's square.
And the shoots that the servant of them made of me.
Don't be afraid of her.
They're tolerants with her.
What was I an empty pot?
They look for the craps, unswervingly consistent,
But consensive to si-memos, not consensive to them.
They look and smile.
They smile tolerant to the involuntary servant.
The big scald with stars walks.
A shine caco, turned from the out of shine, between the stars.
My work? My main soul? My life?
I'm in a shit.
And the gods look at him, for they don't know why stayed there."

pois que é no que perdido foi que fomos deixando que se viva.”
por que ousaremos então mentir, gentil companheiro?
valerá o esforço em simular, a nossos pobres seguidores,

mentiremos sim, mas por razões distintas, algumas as referiste,
outras mercê de não nos vermos vacilar numa partida mais.

a linha que da vida fomos consentindo que se faça.

once more enjoy, on the hill, the vast cold of the approaching end,
not without first remembering how the sun struck the trampled
grass where in groups, under the plane trees, we could feel
in our voices the shiver from ceira that blew through our hair –
“all we can do is wave farewell, wave always and without regret,
since it’s through what we lose that we let life go on living.”
so why will we dare to lie, gentle friend?
what’s the use of pretending, to those who will follow us,
that our salutations are but a way to compensate our fear?
we will lie, yes, but for different reasons, some that you mentioned,
others born of our loathing to vacillate in another departure.
like summer under the acrid smell of the first rains,
we grow with changes occurring in our soul, securing
the line we’ve allowed our life to trace.

That will only enjoy us in luckness, always enjoy, and without remorse,
For what it was in what lost it was that we was let it live.
Why will we dare to lie, my gentle man?
It will be worth the effort in simuling, to our poor followers,
That in the salutations we are not more than compensing our fear?
We'll lie yes, but for different reasons, somebody you mentiond them,
It's others for us not to see it quiver in a game anymore.
Precisely, so does the acre smell of the first rains about the summer,
we grow from soul to soul that in us passes and tires

Sister, or mother, or day.
The water is the water and it is beautiful for that.
If I call you my sister,
As I call you my sister, I see that it isn't
And if she is the water the best is to call her water;
Or, better still, don't call her anything,
But to drink her, to feel her on her hips, to look at her
And all this without any name."
"dizia
que viajar é poder partir-se para o lugar
em frente,
que cada lugar só impressiona porque sugere
a visibilidade do próximo.
e que no fim, quando abandonamos tudo
e já não ouvimos senão o repique dos sinos,
as paisagens deixam de existir para não
passar do que a respiração liberta.
“o que nos conduz é podermos sepultar o
corpo noutro lugar;
porque em todos os sítios passados deixámos o corpo
à vista do lugar mais próximo.”
percebi, sem que mostrasse algum temor,
que havia descoberto a transparência do mundo,
que fora auxiliado pela face
suspensa dos viajantes.
e lembrei-me como o tempo havia de ensinar,
desde a juventude à velhice,
que onde a beleza assola habituamo-nos a uma pausa nos
olhos, nas mãos e nos olhos que são o que nos diz do
pouco do que nos fica sempre.","he said

traveling is being able to depart for the place
up ahead,
each place impressing us only because it suggests
the next one that will come into view.
and in the end, when we let go of everything
and hear nothing but the bells’ tolling,
the landscapes cease to exist, being no more
than our breathing set free.
“what impels us is our being able to bury
the body in another place,
since everywhere we’ve been we left our body
within sight of the place just beyond.”
i understood that, without showing any fear,
he’d discovered the world’s transparency,
he’d been helped by the hovering
faces of travelers.
and i remembered how time teaches us,
from early youth to old age,
to allow a pause in our eyes whenever beauty overwhelms,
a pause in our hands and eyes which are what tell us
the small part of us that always remains.",pt_XX,en_XX,"it says
that travels is to be able to leave to the place

that every place just impresses because it gets
The visibility of the neighbor.
And that in the end, when we abandon everything
And we no longer heard the repice of the bells,
The lands not exist to not
pass than the breathe frees it.
What guides us is to be able to sepult the
- body in somewhere;
because in all past places we left the body
In the view of the next place.
I realized, without showing any fear,
that had discovered the transparence of the world,
that was been helped by the face
Suspended from the travelers.
And I remembered how time was to teach,
It's from the young to the old,
that where beauty walks, we're habituate to a pause in the
Eyes, in the hands and in the eyes that are what tells us of
Little of what we always have."

"o caminho de ohrid*
do alto das muralhas de ohrid onde
acorrera aos gritos desvairados dos vigias,
o rei samuel avistou o seu exército desfigurado,
arrastando-se entre as montanhas da macedónia.
aos catorze mil homens tinham sido
arrancados os olhos por ordem do imperador
e a um em cada cem mandara ele, basílio ii,
fosse poupado um olho para conduzirem o regresso
dessa manada cega. depois de atravessarem altas neves
vinham-se agora despenhando para o lago,
tropeçando, agarrados uns aos outros,
a tortura espelhada nas contorções das faces,
o sangue a empapar-lhes os andrajos. e o rei,
tomado pela angústia, deu um grito de dor e morreu
no alto da muralha sobre a colina e os seus bosques e pomares
que o lago placidamente reflectia.
nesse instante compreendeu como era ambígua
a força cega do destino e em nenhum mosteiro
podia a iconostase explicar-lhe esse cruel mistério:
os santos, com feições dos retratos do fayoum,
entre as chamas trémulas emudeciam
nos seus frescos e as vozes dos jovens monges,
no seu canto austero e imperturbado,
elevavam uma grave primavera na penumbra.","the road to ohrid*
from the heights of the walls of ohrid
to where he’d run upon hearing the screams
of the look-outs, king samuel beheld his disfigured
army dragging through the macedonian mountains.
the eyes of the fourteen thousand men had been
gouged by order of the emperor, basil the second,
who had instructed that one eye be spared in every
hundredth man so that they could lead the return
of that blind herd. having crossed over the high snows
they now came rushing down toward the lake,
stumbling and grabbing on to one another,
the torture mirrored in their facial contortions,
blood soaking their tattered clothes, and the king,
seized by anguish, uttered a shout of grief and died
on the heights of the walls over the hill and his forests and groves
which the lake so peacefully reflected.
in that instant he understood just how ambiguous
the blind force of destiny was, and in no monastery
could the screens of icons have elucidated that cruel mystery:
the saints, whose faces resembled fayumic portraits,
remained silent in their frescos amid the flickering
flames, and the voices of the young monks,
in their austere and unyielding chant,
were lifting up a grave spring in the shadows.",pt_XX,en_XX,"The path of ohrid*

hurt to the screams of the vigils,
The King Samuel seed his defied arm,
Crassing between the mountains of the Macedonia.

from the eyes by the emptyor's order
And to one in every centuries I'd beg him, basil ii,
You'd be sparing an eyes to guide the return
It's this blind herd. It's been crossing high snows.
They'd be coming to the lake now,
Twisting, grabbing together,
The torture mirrored in the contortions of the faces,
The blood drinking their screams. And the king,
Take it from the anxiety, screamed of pain and died
At the top of the wall on the round and their forests and powers
That the lake smoothly returned.
At this moment, he understands how it was ambible
The blind force of destiny and in no monstery
Iconostase could explain this cruel mystery to him:
The saints, with feelings of the portraits of the fayoum,
between the flame threams emudeciate
in their frescoes and the voices of the young Mongs,
In his austere and unturbed song,
They elevated a grave spring in the darkness."

uma mulher estava nos cuidados intensivos
enevoada em suas ligaduras
e tubos nas narinas e nas mãos
que se agitavam e tudo era metálico,
mas ela, a retalhada,
era só tempo incerto, interrogado e trôpego,
só gemido sem voz quando o homem ansioso
se debruçava na contagem dos segundos,
mas ela, a gotejante,
era um puro intervalo numa frouxa fronteira,
só um peso de pálpebras e noite espessa, quando ele, debruçado,
murmurava as palavras, as que ela não ouvia.
terminada a visita, um olhar de relance, um último
desse dia, cercou-a de silêncios pensativos.
a interrogação, a negação da esperança, são como a rosa negra
das condições da esperança.
despiu a bata branca obrigatória, foi-se devagar
e guardou-lhe o rosto translúcido envolto em gazes leves.
há quanto tempo foi? em que lugar, em que manhã furtiva da memória?
quem era o homem? que palavras proferia?
hoje não sei. é como ver da rua uma figura entre cortinas
numa corrente de ar, às vezes penso que era eu,
mas pergunto também, seria alguém por mim, numa curva do tempo,
a murmurar tão baixo palavras esquecidas?
mas se não era eu, como é que soube dessa voz comovida
a resvalar assim até ser inaudível
fora do coração? e se era eu, como pude
tão de dentro falar, tão apagadamente?
porque eu procuro outros andamentos do mundo,
outros nós na garganta, mais pensados a frio, outras intensidades
sacudidas, mais distantes da emoção imediata,
e nunca mais diria palavras tão obscuras.
não interessa quem era. os mares, os ventos
rolaram e rodaram e foram erodindo verdades, circunstâncias.

a woman lay in intensive care
in a fog of bandages with tubes
entering her nostrils and hands,
which twitched, and it was all metallic,
but she, the cut and punctured,
was just a question of tottering, uncertain time,
just a voiceless moan when the troubled man
leaned over in the countdown of seconds,
but she, the dripper,
was a pure interlude on a weak frontier,
just the weight of eyelids and thick night, when he, leaning over,
murmured the words she didn’t hear.
when the visit was over, a glance, the last one
of that day, wrapped her in pensive silences.
questioning and hope’s negation are like the black rose
of the conditions for hope.
he removed the obligatory white smock, slowly walked out,
and tucked away the translucent face wrapped in thin gauze.
how long ago was it? in what place, in what furtive morning of memory?
who was the man? what words did he proffer?
i no longer know. it’s like seeing from the street a figure
through wind-blown curtains. sometimes i think it was me,
but i also wonder if someone in my stead, in a fold of time,
might have so softly murmured the forgotten words.
but if it wasn’t me, how did i know about that choked voice
that kept slipping until it could no longer be heard
outside the heart? and if it was me, how could i
have spoken so inwardly, in such a muffled tone?
because it’s other rhythms i seek in the world, other,
more coldly considered knots in the throat, other trembling
intensities, more detached from immediate emotion,
and i would never again say such obscure words.

have billowed and rolled, slowly eroding truths, circumstances.

In a rain of air, sometimes I think it was me,

other nodes in the throat, more thought cold, other intensities

It's like the rain, It's like the rain, It's like the rain, It's like the rain, it's like the rain, it's like the rain, it's like the rain, it's like the rain, it's like the rain, it's like the rain, it's like the rain, it's like the rain, it's like the rain, it's like the rain, it's like the rain, it's like the rain, it's like the rain, it's like the rain, it's like the rain, it's like the rain, it's like the rain, it's like the rain,
And I was in a great wind; and I was; and I saw:
I saw the shadow of god. And, dazzling,
I got down to that shadow, and, in me, I feel
The earth in flower and the every started sky."

"um cão para pompeia
aos amantes enlaçados contraponho
um cão de pompeia, decerto ele andaria
a brincar junto ao forum, à cata de algum osso,
quando o vesúvio o caçou, mais lesto,
para moldá-lo em pedra-pomes.
insisto em vê-lo como um bicho magro e descuidado,
de penúria diuturna. passou de leve
pelos peristilos, alheio ao luxo, à corrupção,
à astrologia, e nunca dos triclínios
lhe caiu um naco envenenado, nunca se tornou
nem animal simbólico, nem mito que ganisse.
nunca foi encontrado nas escavações, mas é para aqui chamado.
era um cão, just a dog, com pulgas e
que alçava a perna como todos os cães
e ladrava e mordia quando era preciso.
fazia pela vida e, fauno das esquinas, pelas cadelas no cio.
alguma tabuleta diria cave canem em tésseras minúsculas,
sem alaridos da história, e só sobreviveu
nos livros de latim expurgados, misturada
com a guerra das gálias e alguns nomes de deuses.
eu canto um cão sem fábula nem pedigree, que não fugiu aos fados,
um rafeiro vulgar, digamos, de plínio
o velho que, a propósito, morreu perto dali,
talvez uivando, uns dias depois dele.
“você é um cerebral”, disse-me cloé, flava e enervada.
“sim”, disse-lhe eu com prudência, “mas há tantos.
e o amor e a morte sempre foram pensáveis”.
e acrescentei “e depois? que mal faz isso ao cão?”","a dog for pompei
rather than a pair of embracing lovers i propose
a dog from pompei. one that was no doubt
frolicking next to the forum, in search of a bone,
when friskier vesuvius caught and molded him
into pumice-stone. i insist
on seeing him as a scrawny, neglected creature
for whom poverty was a way of life. he skipped
through peristyles, a stranger to luxury, to corruption
to astrology, and no poisoned morsel ever befell him
from the triclinia, he never became
a symbolic animal or barking myth.
he was never found in any excavation, but we summon him now.
he was just a dog, un chien, who had fleas and
raised his paw like all dogs
and yelped and bit when necessary.
he lived for today and, faun of street corners, for bitches in heat.
a sign no doubt read cave canem in tiny tesserae,
making no mark in history, surviving only
in expurgated books in latin, mixed up
with the gallic wars and a few names of gods.
i sing of a dog without fable or pedigree, who didn’t escape fate,
an ordinary mutt belonging, let’s say, to pliny
the elder, who happens to have died nearby,
perhaps screaming, a few days later.
“you’re so cerebral,” said vexed and golden-haired chloe.
“yes,” i replied cautiously, “but so are a lot of other people.
and love and death have always been ponderable.”
“besides,” i added, “what harm does it do the dog?”",pt_XX,en_XX,"it's a dog for pompry

it was a dog, just a dog, with fingers and
it would take it up like all the dogs
And scraped and bied when it was need.
it was for life and, faun of the corners, for the children in the heat.
So, some tabulette would say caves canines in miniscule tessers,
Without the lacks of story, and just survived
In the latiny books expurced, mixed
With the war of the galias and something of the name of the gods.
I sing a dog without a fable or a pedigree, who didn't run to fadoes,
A vulgar rafeiro, say, of plínio
The old who, by the way, died by the way,
Maybe waiving, a couple of days after him.
You're a woman, he said to me, crazy and enraged.
""Yeah, I said to her with prudence, but there are so many.
And love and death was always believable.
And I add it at then? What does it hard to do to the dog?"

"para a educação sentimental
tantas vezes se vive de uma arrebatada
noção dos contrastes mais fortes entre o bem e o
mal, entre a grandeza e a abjecção, entre as rápidas
peripécias de um heroísmo ansioso e o destino inexorável,
que o melodrama é da nossa mais funda natureza,
nostálgica, obscuramente nostálgica do coração radical,
do que vai à desfilada nos sonhos contraditórios,
do que engendra imagens capciosas e julga viver em liberdade,
mas é só imprudente e explosivo, mas esbarra
nas malhas deste mundo, nos imprevistos
da traição e da morte, ou tem de renunciar perante os rasgos
mais sublimes. a paixão dilacera bruscamente as personagens
apegadas à felicidade, os obstáculos
também têm protagonistas, ajustes de contas, cruéis fulgores,
perseguições, e nos casos desvairados de amor não há saída.
desse falhanço insuportável nasce o melodrama,
lírico, incontido, entre golfadas de espiral vertiginosa
com o sangue e a memória, com o que não tem remédio e a música trágica,
em que alguém vai morrer, alguém se perde alucinado,
e alguém se salva e porventura alguém escreve
a história e alguém lhe junta a música
para as emoções serem mais opressivas e talvez mais devoradoras
e mais fáceis, e alguém tem o desejo disso, um estremecimento
de arrepio e vulgaridade, um ávido prazer inconfessado.","sentimental education
we often live according to a rash
notion of stark contrasts between good
and evil, greatness and wretchedness, the swift deeds
of an avid heroism and the inexorable march of destiny,
melodrama being part of our deepest nature,
obscurely but stubbornly nostalgic for the radical heart,
which races at top speed in contradictory dreams,
which engenders seductive images and thinks it lives in freedom,
but it’s merely reckless and explosive, it stumbles
into the world’s snares, into unexpected
treachery and death, or it must renounce in the face of the most
sublime flashes. passion rudely lacerates people
attached to happiness. the obstacles we meet
also have protagonists, scores to settle, cruel splendors,
feverish pursuits. and in desperate cases of love there’s no way out.
from that unbearable failure is born lyrical, unbridled
melodrama, amid whirling, dizzying spurts
of blood and memory, of dashed hopes and tragic music,
in which someone dies, someone goes mad,
and someone is saved, and maybe someone writes down
the story, and someone else adds music
for the emotions to be more oppressive and perhaps more consuming
and facile, and someone desires this, it makes someone feel a shiver
of tingling banality, a voracious and unconfessed thrill.",pt_XX,en_XX,"it's for the midnessal education
it's so many times, it's living from a hug
The notion of the strongest contrasts becoming between well and well
It's bad, between greatness and abjection, between the fast
The peripecias of an anxiety heroism and the inexorable destiny,
That melodrama is of our deepest nature,
Nostalgic, darkly nostalgic of the radical heart,
of what goes to the party in the adverstory dreams,
What begets captius images and thinks to live in freedom,
But it's only imprudent and explosive, but it starts
In the nets of this world, in the unprevented
of treason and death, or have to resign in front of the tides
More sublime. passion hurtly discerates the charls
closed to happiness, the obstacles
They also have protagonists, adjustments of account, cruel flashes,
Persecutions, and in the different case of love, there is no way out.
The melodrama is born from this insufferable failure,
Lyric, uncontained, between gloves of vertiginous spiral
With the blood and the memory, with what there has no remedium and the tragical music,
When someone is going to die, someone is lost hallucinate,
And someone saves and someone writes
The story and someone adds to the music
so the emotions can be more opressive and maybe more everying
And easier, and someone has the desire of that, a quiver
It's a blood and vulgarity, an avid unconfessed pleasure."

against grief the conduit of our lives.

the dreams filed away in memory’s dark

pela branca pedra do teu rosto e quedam-se

ó minha vida esse processo que perdi","on the hill of this moment
a hint of absinthe fills the air when the beetles
emerging from the rotten bark of the old oaks
begin their flight in the month of june
picking hazelnuts we walk through the garden
where the lindens’ aroma wafts in the breeze
the coolness of the fruit defeats the declining sun
we are who we used to be walking so softly
with so much childlike dignity
that here not even death would remember us
nor would the monstrous flower of other destinies
or any other of the republics of hatred
stir up the calm sea of this late afternoon
it is to the sacred celebration of chance
to the feast of the world’s mineral essence
that the sun is proceeding in this temple’s inner sanctum
the afternoon is everything and everything is pathways
we are the chosen assistants to this hour
here summer’s insanity doesn’t arrive
and i quit loathing my ancestors
and i rise as the last light flickers
for a moment i am i and here no one died
o my life that process i left behind",pt_XX,en_XX,"On the colline of the instant
There's a smell of abstinct when the childs
from the marred evil of the old oaks
They begin your flying for the month of june
we hold hails through the garden
Where the tilias to the wind scatter the aroma
The fretness of fruit wins the smoking sun
we're the one who were we walked so slowly
We have so much dignity of children
just as death wouldn't even remember us
it's not even the monstless flower of other destinies
it's not anything from the republics of hate
The calm sea of the end of the afternoon
it's the sagred celebration of chance
to the party of the mineral essence of the world
that the sun goes on in the secret of this temple
The afternoon is everything and everything are paths
we're elected complicit of the time
The destatin of the summer doesn't come here
I forget the aversion of my forefathers
And I wake up on the final light
For instants I'm no one died here

scanning the future in the stars on high.

"uma forma de me despedir
há o mar há a mulher
quer um quer o outro me chegam em acessíveis baías
abertas talvez no adro amplo das tardes dos domingos
oiço chamar mas não de uma forma qualquer
chamar mas de uma certa maneira
talvez um apelo ou uma presença ou um sofrimento
ora eu que no fundo
apesar das muitas palavras vindas nas muitas páginas dos dicionários
bem vistas as coisas disponho somente de duas palavras
desde a primeira manhã do mundo
para nomear só duas coisas
apenas preciso de as atribuir
não sei se gosto mais do mar
se gosto mais da mulher
sei que gosto do mar sei que gosto da mulher
e quando digo o mar a mulher
não digo mar ou mulher só por dizer
ao dizer o mar a mulher
há penso eu um certo tom na minha voz sinto um certo travo na boca
que mostram que mais que palavras usadas para falar
dizer como eu digo a mulher o mar
mar mulher assim ditos
são uma maneira talvez de gostar
e a consciência de que se gosta
e um prazer em o dizer
um gosto afinal em gostar
enfim o mar a mulher
pode num dos casos ser a/mar a mulher
mera forma talvez de uniformizar o artigo
definido do singular
há ondas no mar
o mar rebenta em ondas espraiadas nos compridos cabelos da mulher
que ela faz ondular melhor de tarde em tarde
no mês de setembro nas marés vivas
o melhor da mulher talvez o olhar
é para mim o mar da mulher
e à mulher que um só dia encontro na vida
de passagem um simples momento num sítio qualquer
talvez a muitos quilómetros do mar
mas mulher que não mais consigo esquecer
mesmo imerso na dor ou submerso em cuidados
a essa mulher qualquer
eu chamo mulher do mar
nos fins de setembro quando eu partir
de uma cidade seja ela qual for
quando eu pressentir que alguém morre
que alguma coisa fica para sempre nos dias
e ou nuns olhos ou numa água
num pouco de água ou em muita água
onda do mar lágrima ou brilho do olhar
eu recear seriamente vir-me a submergir
direi alto ou baixo conforme puder
com a boca toda ou já a custar-me a engolir
as palavras mar ou mulher
com certo vagar e cada vez mais devagar
mulher mar
depois quase já só a pensar
o mar a mulher
não sei mas será
talvez mais que outra coisa qualquer

there’s ocean there’s woman
and both of them reach me in amiable bays
opening up for example in the churchyard of sunday afternoons
i hear them call but not just any old way
they call in a particular manner
perhaps as a petition or a presence or a suffering
the fact is that basically
and despite all the words in all the pages of dictionaries
i really only have since the world’s first morning
two words at my disposal
to name just two things
whatever two i choose
i’m not sure which i like more
whether ocean or woman
i know i like ocean i know i like woman
and when i say ocean when i say woman
i don’t say ocean or woman just to say it
when i say ocean when i say woman
there’s a certain tone in my voice a certain taste in my mouth
which seem to me to clearly show that ocean and woman
as i say ocean as i say woman
pronounced ocean pronounced woman
are not just words used for speaking
but are perhaps a way of liking
and the awareness of liking
and a pleasure in saying so
a liking of the fact of liking
woman-ocean is after all
close to womb-emotion
if we forget the letters
and obey the sense of sound
there are waves in the ocean
the ocean breaks in waves that spread in the woman’s long hair
and she makes it wave better now and then
in the month of september when the tide is highest
probably the best part of woman namely her gaze
is for me the woman’s ocean
and the woman i meet only once in life
crossing her path for just a moment wherever it may be
perhaps many miles from the ocean
but a woman i can’t ever forget
no matter how awash i am in sorrows or worries
is the woman whatever woman
i call the woman from the ocean
in that late september when i depart
from a city whatever city
when i can feel that someone is dying
that something lingers forever in the days
and i sincerely fear i might sink
into some eyes or into water
into a little or a lot of water
an ocean wave a tear or a glassy gaze
i’ll say loudly or softly however i’m able
with wide-open mouth or already choking
the words ocean or woman
slowly and ever slower almost in slow motion
woman ocean
then almost as just a vague notion
ocean woman

I just need to ascribe them

If I like a woman more
I know I like the sea I know I like the woman
And when I say the sea, the woman
I don't say sea or woman just for saying
how to say the sea the woman
There's think I'm a certain tone in my voice I feel a certain tone in my mouth
that show more than words used to talk
To say how I say the woman the sea

The sea blosts in waves splaid in the long hair of a woman
That it makes it better in the afternoon in the afternoon
In the month of september, in the ties of live
Maybe the best of a woman's eyes
It's for me the sea of a woman
And to the woman that one day I find in my life
by the passage of a simple moment in anywhere
Maybe a lot of miles from the sea
But a woman I can't forget anymore
even didden in pain or didden in care
to this woman of mine
I call a woman from the sea
At the end of september when I leave
from a city, be it whate it is
When I feel someone dies
that something stays forever in the days
it is in an eyes or in a water
In a little water or in a lot of water
Wave of the sea tear or shine of the eyes
I'm gravely afraid to come and submerge
I'll say up or down as far as I can
With your mouth or already costing me to swrinkle
The words sea or woman
With a certain walk and slower and slower
it's a sea woman
Then almost just thinking about it
it's the sea, it's the woman
I don't know, but it will be
Maybe more than something else

"o último poeta romano
enquanto rebentam as ondas junto às praias,
e há troar de canhões além dos muros da cidade,
queria o direito a uma hora indulgente e fugaz,
num espaço inviolável,
guardado pelas asas da musa e os provérbios da sibila
como o actor recolhido aos bastidores do teatro.
esquecidos os sonhos da cabeça adornada por folhas de louro
ou os canapés onde se alongam as últimas almas epicuristas,
num sossego adverbial, em que nada mais ouvisse,
tudo ele pudesse guardar, no âmbito da sua arte,
com a leveza que deixa a pluma ao roçar o papel.
purificada, ao salivá-la como hóstia sob a língua,
cada palavra tivesse a autoridade da grinalda
ou do selo real
e estreitasse numa sebe o mundo que conheceu,
enquanto tudo se gentiliza e desmorona à sua volta.
nesse trabalho de falcoaria sobre o tempo ido,
escrever lembra-lhe os cortes feitos pela navalha
do prisioneiro na parede da cela, contando os dias,
certo de esperá-lo o nó corrediço da forca
ou o tiro disparado de frente sobre o crânio.

à dispersão,
deseja salvar, consoladora e suficiente,

as waves break over the beaches
and cannons boom beyond the city walls,
he asks for one fleeting, indulgent hour
in an inviolable place,
shielded by the muse’s wings and the sibyl’s words
like an actor gone backstage.
forgetting the dream of a laurel-crowned head
and the couches that cradle the last epicurean souls,
he longs only for adverbial quiet – not a sound –
in which all might be preserved, in the ambit of his art,
with the lightness of a quill passing over paper.
that each word, purified, rolling on the tongue
like a host, might have the authority of a garland
or royal seal
and press the world he knew into a hedge
as everything degenerates and collapses around him.
in this work of falconry applied to time past,
writing reminds him of the notches the prisoner
cuts in the wall of his cell to count the days,
knowing what will come: the slipknot of the gallows
or a shot fired straight into his brain.

As long as everything gentilizes and falls around you.
In this wordwork on time good,
Write remembers the cuts made by the snipe
from the prisoner on the wall of the prison, telling the days,
it's right to wait for you, the slipping know of the gight
Or the shoot shooted face to face on the cranium.
Knowing all of your work gave in this time
to the dispersion,
You want to save, comforting and suffering,
Your word on the face of a future stale."

assomas no arco da porta com teu rosto de cera
e seguras o colar num gesto extravagante,
defendida de mais uma piada suburbana.
“espera-te o museu”, ia dizer, numa derrisão fatal.
a palavra é recolher sem perda de tempo
e tudo receber com uma última aclamação.
rufam tambores, querida, como nos tempos
antigos, ébrios de sangue, chamando-nos
à cerimónia sacrificial. o rosto que nos promete
o televisor, vê, tem algo de ancestral e terrífico
quando o vemos a meio da fatídica arenga.
mutismo. em casa não temos almofada de joelhos
e a segurança, já o sabemos, é o teu sonho preferido,
se te debruças para os toldos e a linha da água.
vais até à varanda como testemunha ocular dos fogos
que se acendem, inelutavelmente, na distância.
vejo como o medo em ti cinzela uma estátua
de olhar velado e face muda, inexpressiva,
recolhida, como estás, dentro de ti,
ao esconderijo mais abstruso de todos.
2
chegados um ao outro, felizes se ouvimos
um ruído clamoroso na distância, olhamo-nos,
pois cumprida é a promessa, o sacramento
de ordem com que fomos investidos pelo tempo.
que fazer, perguntas. içar o velame
ou escavar em casa a galeria de mina,
desertando os dois, por um fuso horário,
na descida para os antípodas do mundo?
tomar um revulsivo ou deixarmo-nos ir,
movidos pelo vento, sob a aba dos telhados?
nada poderás levar, num último arrebatamento.
tu mesma serás presa, na tarde momentosa,
de quando foi desejo teu e perdes sem apelo
sob a lei da plebe ou uma qualquer ordem
pretoriana, sentenciada ao motivo bíblico
e à resignação de uma existência romana.
hoje tens só a imitação do teu rosto
no espelho. e nada mais te cumpre defender
à hora de sublevarem-se as obras de deus
(além do olhar, vê, tens ainda o mundo inteiro . . .).","de temporum fine comoedia
1
you loom in the doorway with your waxen face,
flamboyantly clutching your necklace
like a shield against one more suburban joke.
“rehearsing for the museum?” i thought to shoot.
the order of the day is to retreat in haste
and to salute everything with a last hurrah.
drums are rolling, dear, as in olden times, drunk
with blood, calling us to the sacrificial rite.
there’s something ancestral and terrifying
about the face the television promises, look,
in the middle of its ominous harangue.
no comment. we don’t have kneeling pads
at home, and if you lean out to the umbrellas along
the shore, we know security is your preferred dream.
you go to the balcony as an eyewitness of the fires
inevitably blazing in the distance.
i see how fear chisels in you a statue
with veiled gaze and a speechless,
expressionless face, withdrawn into you,
the most recondite hiding place of all.
2
together now, happy if we hear a racket
in the distance, we look at each other,
for the promise is fulfilled, the ritual
sacrament conferred on us by time.
what should we do, you ask. hoist the sails
or dig a mine shaft in the floor, deserting
who we are as we descend time’s tunnel
to reach the world’s antipodes?
swallow a pill or let ourselves go,
pushed by the wind, beneath the eaves?
you cannot, in a final rapture, take anything.
you’ll be the prey, on that crucial day,
of all you desired and lose, without appeal,
under mob rule or some praetorian
order, sentenced to biblical logic
and the resignation of roman existence.
all you have today is your face’s imitation
in the mirror. and that’s all you'll have to defend
in the hour when god's creation rebels (and beyond
your gaze – look! – there's still the whole world . . .).",pt_XX,en_XX,"it's time to go way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way

You smoke in the door's ark with your face of wass
And you hold the collar in an extravagant gesture,
It's defended of another builban joke.
The muses waiting for you, I'd say, in a fatal derision.
The word is to recoup without time lose
And everything to be received with a final acclamation.
Trums running, my girl, like the times

At the sacrificial Ceremony. The face that promises us
The televisor, see, has something of ancestor and terrific
When we see it in the middle of the fatidic storm.
Mutism. At home, we don't have a knee-to-knee pillow
And seety, we already know it, it's your favorite dream,
If you walk to the awnings and the waterline.
You go all the way to the balconn as an ocular view of the fire
What them alight, inescapable, in the distance.
I see how fear in you burns a statue
with a seeling eyes and a changed face, inexpressive,
Collected, as you are, inside of you,
To the furthest hide of all.
2
Come together, happy if we hear
A crying noise in the distance, we look at them,
because the promise is met, the sacrament
It's an admonishment how we've been enjoyed by time.
What to do, questions. to get the sail
Or excaver the mine's galeria,
Deserting the two, for a time zone,
On the down to the antipodes of the world?
Take a revulsive or let us go,
Moved by the wind, down the ground of the roofs?
You won't be able to take anything, in a final rhyming.
You'll be in prison for yourself, in the midness afternoon,
from when it was your desire and you lose without about it

Pretorian, admonished to the Bible's reason
And to the resignation of a Roman existence.
Today you've only the imitation of your face
In the mirror. And nothing else before you
When the works of god are surrendered
(beyond the eyes, see, you've already the whole world...)"

happy the man who manages sadness wisely
and learns to divide it among the days
though months and years pass it will never leave him
how sad it is to grow old on the doorstep
while weaving in our hands a belated heart
how sad to risk against human returns
the blue equilibrium of summer’s sheer mornings
by the ocean that overflows with us
in the long farewell of our condition
it is sad to see in the garden the sun’s solitude
reaching from the city’s houses and din
to a distant hint of river
and the meager life meted out to us
it is sadder to have to be born and to die
and to have trees at the end of the street
it is sad to go through life as if
returning and to enter humbly into death by mistake
it is sad in autumn to conclude that summer
was the only season
the wind passed by in solidarity and we didn’t see it
and we didn’t know to go to the green depths
like rivers that know where to find the sea
and know which bridges which streets which people which hills to talk with
through the words of a forever uttered water

it is sad to buy chestnuts after the bullfight
between sunday and the smoke on a november afternoon
and to have asphalt and many people for your future

through the sea through of us

The loneliness of the sun is sad in the garden

it's even a vague promise of a river

and there was always a way out when needed
when was all this? not even i can say
i know only that i had a child’s power
all things were close to me and everything
was possible i only had to want it",pt_XX,en_XX,"And everything was possible
in my youngry before I've left
from the house of my parents, desired to travel
I've already knew the blost of the sea
from the pages of the books I'd already read

The morning walk went up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up

of life as if it happened
And everything happened in another life

When was that? I don't know how to say it
I only know I had the power of a children
between things and me there was a neighbor
And everything was possible was just to want"
"os gregos

esta existência desejávamos para nós próprios homens
por isso repetíamos os gestos rituais que restabelecem
o estar-ser-inteiro inicial das coisas –

and the great dome of resonant weightless free air
emerged as self-aware consciousness
with no loss of the first day’s marriage-and-feast oneness
anxious to have this experience for ourselves
we humans repeated the ritual gestures that re-establish
the initial whole presence of things –
this made us attentive to all forms known by the light of day
as well as to the darkness which lives within us
and in which the ineffable shimmer travels",pt_XX,en_XX,"The Greeks

The meandro of the river the sole fire of the mountain
it's the great abubada of the sound air and light and free
They emerged in a conscience that you see
Without losing the one-boda-e-fest of the first day –
this existence, we wanted for our own men
that's why we replayed the ritual gestures that remain

it made us aware of all the ways the sun light knows
And to the inner dark why we are lived
And in where the shine is indicible"

children who are the wind’s victims
and sometimes my virtual victims
victims right now of my eyes that don’t see them now

pure dust stirred up for a moment by the wind

children who are defined by their growth
who sometimes completely consist in contentment
children like reeds that lightly bend in the wind

now springing up over there forever self-detached
almost weightless almost footless children
swaying on stalks in the wind
and sometimes wrapped in its cloak as if by magic

things we sometimes doubt
things we’re not quite sure exist
seeming to be one moment seeming not to be the next
being perhaps living victims of doubt

who weren’t here even when they were here

pure dust to the wind I turn a moment
children that a just thought can take
it's the children who define them by the growing
that in the contentment sometimes of everything contains
Crazy children who see light to the wind
of the instant children that pray here concentrate
Now, you'll always stand away from yourself
Children almost without weight almost without feet
Swinging in the bars to the wind
it's like by charm, sometimes wrapped in your dress

things which doubts sometimes
that we almost don't know if they are or are not they

"a flor da solidão
vivemos convivemos resistimos
cruzámo-nos nas ruas sob as árvores
fizemos porventura algum ruído
traçámos pelo ar tímidos gestos
e no entanto por que palavras dizer
que nosso era um coração solitário
silencioso profundamente silencioso
e afinal o nosso olhar olhava
como os olhos que olham nas florestas
no centro da cidade tumultuosa
no ângulo visível das múltiplas arestas
a flor da solidão crescia dia a dia mais viçosa
nós tínhamos um nome para isto
mas o tempo dos homens impiedoso
matou-nos quem morria até aqui
e neste coração ambicioso
sozinho como um homem morre cristo
que nome dar agora ao vazio
que mana irresistível como um rio?
ele nasce engrossa e vai desaguar
e entre tantos gestos é um mar

sem bem saber que em tudo um pouco nós morremos","flower of solitude
we lived we conversed we resisted
we crossed paths on the street under the trees
we perhaps made a little stir
we traced timid gestures in the air
but what words can explain
that ours was a solitary and silent
profoundly silent heart
and in the end our eyes watched
like eyes that watch in forests
in the midst of the tumultuous city
in the visible angle of its countless edges
the flower of solitude grew lusher each day
we had a name for this
but the ruthless time of men
killed in us the one who was dying
and in this ambitious heart
alone like a man christ dies
what shall we call the void that flows
relentless as a river?
it is born it swells it will empty

just like the eyes that look in the forests
in the centre of the tumultuou city
At the visible angle of the multiple arrows

But the time of ungodly men
You killed us, who would die here

"algumas proposições com pássaros e árvores que
o poeta remata com uma referência ao coração
os pássaros nascem na ponta das árvores
as árvores que eu vejo em vez de fruto dão pássaros
os pássaros são o fruto mais vivo das árvores
os pássaros começam onde as árvores acabam
os pássaros fazem cantar as árvores
ao chegar aos pássaros as árvores engrossam movimentam-se
deixam o reino vegetal para passar a pertencer ao reino animal
como pássaros poisam as folhas na terra
quando o outono desce veladamente sobre os campos
gostaria de dizer que os pássaros emanam das árvores
mas deixo essa forma de dizer ao romancista
é complicada e não se dá bem na poesia
não foi ainda isolada da filosofia
eu amo as árvores principalmente as que dão pássaros
quem é que lá os pendura nos ramos?
de quem é a mão a inúmera mão?
eu passo e muda-se-me o coração","a few propositions with birds and trees that
the poet concludes with a reference to the heart
birds are born on the tips of trees
the trees i see yield birds instead of fruit
birds are the liveliest fruit of trees
birds begin where trees end
birds make the trees sing
on reaching the height of birds the trees swell and stir
passing from the vegetable to the animal kingdom
like birds their leaves alight on the ground
when autumn quietly falls over the fields
i feel like saying that birds emanate from the trees
but i’ll leave that manner of speaking to the novelist
it’s complicated and doesn’t work in poetry
it still hasn’t been isolated from philosophy
i love trees especially those that yield birds
who hangs them there on the branches?
whose hand is it whose myriad hand?
i pass by and my heart’s not the same",pt_XX,en_XX,"some propositions with birds and trees that
the poet remains with a reference to the heart
The birds are born on the tip of the firms
The grows I see in place of fruit give birds
The birds are the livest fruit of the groves

The birds sing the firms
On coming to the birds, the growwoods move
They leave the vetry kingdom to belong to the animal kingdom
how birds depose the leafs on the earth
When the Fall descends willly on the fields
I'd like to say that the birds come from the firms
But I leave that way of telling to the romancist

"o jogo do chinquilho
renasce neste largo a minha infância
a minha vida tem aqui nova nascente
e jorra de repente com o ímpeto do início
o tempo não passou ou só a consciência
que provisoriamente sinto de voltar alguns anos atrás
a sensação que sei de reflectir sobre esse tempo
de ser um espectador de sucessivos sucedidos dias
de não viver apenas não viver sem sequer saber que vivo
num espaço demarcado onde as coisas e os homens
eram tanto que eram simplesmente
só essa consciência e sensação me fazem suspeitar
de que passou o tempo que nunca passou
o adro o fim da tarde o jogo do chinquilho
o ruído das malhas os paulitos
o sol poente sobre si redondo como simples
malha atirada por alguém pelo espaço do dia
e prestes a cair no mar como nas tábuas
o gesto perdulário e impensado de jogar
a malha como quem num gesto joga a vida
as silhuetas hirtas dos que assistem
de boné ou barrete na cabeça e mãos nos bolsos
tudo se passa aqui ali há trinta e cinco anos
como se aqui ninguém houvesse envelhecido
nem sofrido ou morrido ou suportado
toda a imensa fome requerida para produzir um rico
como se aqui ninguém tivesse demandado
longe de aqui o seu país noutros países
tudo é o mesmo adro a mesma tarde o mesmo jogo
até este café onde sentado olho e penso por olhar
é afinal o mesmo onde bebi a meias com meu pai
a primeira cerveja uma cerveja vinda
através do calor do dia de verão
nesse cesto de vime nesse poço mergulhado
é o mesmo o sabor que sempre sinto nesta boca
há muitos anos já mordendo o vinho o pão a vida
o sabor das mulheres das raparigas
inacessíveis sempre como um absoluto
sempre impossível tido no entanto por possível
o sabor da derrota ou o sabor da terra
sensível dia a dia nos meus dedos
e um dia susceptível de me encher a boca para sempre
envelheci eu sei e só ganhei
o que perdi. sou de uma adulta idade
e entretanto tudo a noite rodeou e o jogo acabou
e pelo céu do tempo houve um homem que passou
ou uma certa malha arremessada por acaso à vida
e viva na precária trajectória antes de caída","the game of quoits
in this square my childhood resurrects
here my life suddenly has a new wellspring
and surges with the force it had when it started
the time hasn’t passed only my consciousness
which i feel temporarily transported back a few years
only my familiar sensation of reflecting on that time
of being a spectator of the succession of succeeding days
of not just living of not living without even knowing i live
in a delimited space where things and people
evidently were because they simply were
only that consciousness and sensation make me suspect
that the time that never passed has passed
the churchyard in late afternoon the game of quoits
the clatter of the quoits the iron stakes
the sun setting on itself and round like a simple
quoit tossed by someone through the space of the day
and ready to fall into the sea as onto a stake
the extravagant and thoughtless act of tossing
the quoit as if in that act life itself were at stake
the stock-still profiles of those who look on
with caps on their heads and hands in their pockets
it all happened it happens here thirty-five years ago
as if here no one had gotten old
or suffered or died or endured
the enormous hunger needed to produce one rich man
as if no one here had gone in search of his country
in countries far far away from here
it’s the very same churchyard same afternoon same quoits
even this café where i sit watching and watch with my thinking
is the same café where i split my first beer
with my father a beer that resisted
the heat of the summer day
in that wicker basket submerged in that well
it’s the same taste i’ve had in my mouth
for many years now chewing wine and bread and life
the taste of women the taste of girls
forever inaccessible like any absolute
forever impossible yet pursued as if possible
the taste of defeat or the taste of palpable
earth day by day running through my fingers
and one day bound to fill my mouth forever
i’ve aged i know and all i’ve gained
is what i lost. i’m a grown-up now.
meanwhile night has engulfed everything the game is over
and across the sky of time there was a man who passed
or a certain quoit that by chance was hurled into life
and that lives in the precarious trajectory before the fall",pt_XX,en_XX,"it's the chinquile game
My children are reborned in this land
My life is here, new name.
And slip all of a sudden with the start of the start of the start
The time hasn't passed or just the conscience
That provisionally I feel I'm coming back a couple of years after
The feeling I know to think about this time
of being a viewer of successive happen days
of not living just not living without even knowing that I live
In a demarcted space where things and men
it was so much that it was simple
just this conscience and feeling make me suspect
What time has passed that never has passed
I love the end of the afternoon the game of the chinquile
The noise of the knows the paulites
The sun puts on hisround like simple
Thing through someone through the space of the day
And because to fall in the sea like on the plank
The forgiven and unthinked gesture of playing
The work like those who in a gesture plays life
The hirte silhuets of those who see
With a cap or a bar on the head and hands in your pockets
Everything happens here thirty-five years ago

For many years already bittering the wine, the bread, the life
The taste of the women of the girls
Inaccessible always as an absolut
It's always impossible, but it's possible
The taste of defection or the taste of the earth
Susceptible day by day on my fingers
And one day suffering to bring my mouth forever
I've been age I know it and I just win it
What I lost. I'm from an adult age

And so closer to the other in that house
But I see more dark inside the body
And I found that light is a thing of the rich
people who spend life looking at the sun
Take bees in the sex liras in the head
And the night hurts the beach's white snake
You're gonna run, call to the police
And not well for the diamond jeals the powering services and the dresses
I'm saying rich in spirit
Rich in experience
Rich to know how it goes
For one side the semen for one side the coca
And in the sweet intervalars
The urine, the bibliothes, the staries, the drama
All that I've already loved
And hold in the singing of the eyes begging for more light to be true
My English friend didn't remember
of the simple gestures of the beginning
And he ran the drapes and he would keep
Beyond the fleble kiss that we can
The trip without end and without returning"

what’s strange discernible

with the first scream.

"a um rato morto encontrado num parque
este findou aqui sua vasta carreira
de rato vivo e escuro ante as constelações

senão aqueles que tudo querem imenso
e só sabem pensar em termos de homem ou árvore
pois decerto este rato destinou como soube (e até como não soube)
o milagre das patas – tão junto ao focinho! –
que afinal estavam justas, servindo muito bem
para agatanhar, fugir, segurar o alimento, voltar atrás de repente, quando necessário
está pois tudo certo, ó “deus dos cemitérios pequenos”?
mas quem sabe quem sabe quando há engano
nos escritórios do inferno? quem poderá dizer
que não era para príncipe ou julgador de povos
o ímpeto primeiro desta criação
irrisória para o mundo – com mundo nela?
tantas preocupações às donas de casa – e aos médicos – ele dava!
como brincar ao bem e ao mal se estes nos faltam?
algum rapazola entendeu sua esta vida tão ímpar
e passou nela a roda com que se amam
olhos nos olhos – vítima e carrasco
não tinha amigos? enganava os pais?
ia por ali fora, minúsculo corpo divertido
e agora parado, aquoso, cheira mal.

here this creature ended its vast career
as a dark and living rat beneath the starry expanse
its diminutive size only humiliates
those who want everything to be enormous
and who can only think in human or arboreal terms

the miracle of its tiny feet – so close to its snout! –
which were after all just right, serving perfectly
for clawing, scurrying, securing food or beating a retreat, when necessary
so is everything as it should be, o “god of small cemeteries”?
but who knows who can know when a mistake has been made
in hell’s central offices? who can be sure
that this creation so disdained by the world
but with a world inside it
wasn’t initially conceived to be a prince or judge of nations?
the worries it aroused in housewives and physicians!
who are we to play at good and evil when they’re beyond us?
some lad understood the uniqueness of its life
and ran over it with the wheel by which, eye to eye,
the vicitim and the executioner love each other
it had no friends? it deceived its parents?
it ran all about, a tiny body that had fun
and now just lies there, gooshy, smelly.

For I believe this rat destined how he knew (and even how he didn't knew)

that in the end they were right, serving very fine
to snake, run, hoist the grove, turn back all of a sudden, when need
Is everything right, oh, god of the small cemeteries?
But who knows who knows when there's a mistake
In the offices of hell? who can say
That wasn't for a Prince or a judger of people

Irrisory for the world – with world in it?
So many preoccupations to the housewives – and to the doctors – he would give!
how to play to good and to good if them are missessed?

And the road which you love with was passed by her
Eyes in the eyes – victim and charl
You didn't have friends? You deceived your parents?

And now stop, watery, smells bad.

"“sim, fui um profeta”

o mal estar de uma efervescência de ruínas, das folhas

em tumulto, numa pesada respiração, num estertor
de velho. então, vi o fim: a queda sinuosa dos astros, o rosto
de um gelo azul, o ruído de ondas sobrepondo-se à imagem
do ventre rasgado até às entranhas. nenhum exorcismo me restituiu
a força. entrei na procissão dos sonâmbulos,
juntando a voz ao gemido comum. “ – quem é este?” –
“ – o taciturno poeta, o antigo portador de absolvição.”
e comentavam :
“de que nos serve, agora? . . . ” e a maré engrossava
como as nuvens do crepúsculo! entre os homens ainda há

“seek the first degree of happiness in the chorus
of the dead, a final howl of suffering in the obsessiveness
of oystermen . . . ”, and the words came to me
in a tumult, in heavy breaths, in a death rattle

of a blue ice, the sound of waves drowning out the image
of a belly rent to the entrails. no exorcism could restore
my strength. i entered the procession of the sleepwalkers,
uniting my voice to the common lament. “who is this?”
“the taciturn poet, the ancient bearer of absolution.”

“what good is he now? . . . ” and the tide billowed
like the clouds at twilight! among men there are some

– Search in the choir of the dead for the first grade
of happiness; in the obsession of oster fishers

In tumult, in a heavenly breathe, in a storm
As an oldman. I saw the end: the single fall of the stars, the face
from a blue ice, the noise of waves superimposed on the image
It's from my bed to my bed. No exorcism gave me back.
The strength. I got into the procision of the dreambules,
Together the voice to the common grow. Who is this? What is this? What is this? What is this? What is this?
– the poetful taciturn, the old absolution-carrier.
And they'd be commenting:
Wha does it suit us, now? . . . . and the tidal was burning

"meditação sobre ruínas
desembarcou numa sala sem dourados nem cadeiras:
madeiras velhas, jarras com flores de plástico, janelas
de vidros partidos para a auto-estrada. nem vento,
nem mar: só o ruído dos carros entrava pelas fendas
para ecoar no tecto (madeiras à vista entre os restos
de estuque). depois, na rua, pendurou-se nos ferros podres
de antigas varandas. percebia-se, por entre os arbustos
que invadiam tudo, uma vista que teria sido digna
de um quadro romântico. o vale, coberto de casas, e
os montes invadidos por ferro-velho, ocultam um passado
de rebanhos e pastores. mas talvez não se tenha ouvido aqui
a música da flauta. com efeito, esta casa limita-se
a guardar antigos silêncios, que o uso transformou em manchas
sépia na memória. agora, confundem-se com a cor das paredes;
e só abrigam tocas répteis, que apenas se adivinham,
no inverno, escondidos do universo. mas alguém passou por aqui,
há pouco; e um monte de madeira fumega, ainda, enquanto
o sol avança a partir do nascente, onde as cores frias
da madrugada não se dissipam, nem pássaro algum saúda
o nascer do dia.","meditation on ruins
he disembarked in a living room without chairs or gilt mouldings:
just rotting beams, vases with plastic flowers, windows
whose broken panes looked out onto the highway. no wind,
no sea: only the sound of cars entering through the cracks
to echo on the ceiling (rafters showing through the stucco
remains). outside he hung on to the rusted rails
of decrepit balconies. he discerned, through the underbrush
that was overrunning everything, a landscape worthy
of a romantic painting. the houses covering the valley and
the hills taken over by scrap iron hide a past
with flocks and shepherds. but perhaps the flute’s song
was never heard here. indeed, this house conserves nothing
but ancient silences, which the using has transformed into sepia
spots in memory. now they’re blended into the colour of the walls
and harbour only dens of scarcely discernible reptiles,
in winter, hidden from the universe. but someone was here

"receita para fazer azul
se quiseres fazer azul,
pega num pedaço de céu e mete-o numa panela grande,
que possas levar ao lume do horizonte;
depois mexe o azul com um resto de vermelho
da madrugada, até que ele se desfaça;
despeja tudo num bacio bem limpo,
para que nada reste das impurezas da tarde.
por fim, peneira um resto de ouro da areia
do meio-dia, até que a cor pegue ao fundo de metal.
se quiseres, para que as cores se não desprendam
com o tempo, deita no líquido um caroço de pêssego queimado.
vê-lo-ás desfazer-se, sem deixar sinais de que alguma vez
ali o puseste; e nem o negro da cinza deixará um resto de ocre
na superfície dourada. podes, então, levantar a cor
até à altura dos olhos, e compará-la com o azul autêntico.
ambas as cores te parecerão semelhantes, sem que
possas distinguir entre uma e outra.
assim o fiz – eu, abraão ben judá ibn haim,
iluminador de loulé – e deixei a receita a quem quiser,
algum dia, imitar o céu.","recipe for making the colour blue
if you wish to make the colour blue
take a piece of sky and put it in a pot
large enough to place on the flame of the horizon.
stir into the blue a pinch of early morning red
until it dissolves. pour everything
into a brass bowl that has been well washed
to eliminate all of the afternoon’s impurities.
finally, sift in a few smidgens of gold from the sand
of midday until the colour adheres to the bottom of the bowl.
to prevent the colours from separating with time,
drop a charred peach pit into the liquid.
it will disintegrate, leaving no telltale
sign, not even – from the black ash – an ochre trace
on the golden surface. you may then raise the colour
to eye level and compare it with genuine blue.
the two colours will look so alike
that you cannot distinguish one from the other.
this was how i did it – i, abraham ben judah ibn haim,
illuminator from the town of loulé. and i left the recipe
for whoever, one day, would imitate the sky.",pt_XX,en_XX,"Recipe to make blue
If you want to make blue,
Take it in a piece of sky and put it in a big pan,
that you can take to the horizon's light;
Then move the blue with a remain of red

So that nothing remains of the impuritys of the afternoon.
At the end, smile a remain of the sand
It's from the midday, until the color takes up to the metal deep.
If you want, so the colors won't understand
With time, get a burn of burned peace in the liquite.
You'll see him undressed, without leaving signs of that some time
There you put it; and even the black of the Ash will leave a remain of ocre
On the gilded surface. You can, then, up the color
up to the eyes, and compare it to the real blue.
The colors will be similar to you, without that
You can distinguish between the one and the one.

chego em frente do mar, das suas ondas,
das marés que setembro enfurece, dos cinzentos
e azuis que alternam com verdes estranhos;
uma voz trata da loucura, ou do olhar vazio
dos peixes, ou de um tema ressequido como as algas
da maré baixa; um vento percorreu a praia,
no silêncio da tarde, devolvendo ao corpo das águas
uma unidade antiga. o mar, no entanto, supõe
que o esqueçam. nos seus fundos dormem as imagens
que o sonho já não guarda; braços que se agarram
aos mastros do naufrágio. um barco abstracto
passou devagar pelo horizonte que a manhã não viu,
entrando no outro lado da terra, esquecido
por instantes da música dos portos. o poema, disseram-me,
ignorou essa distracção: atravessou
o limite da eternidade, vestiu-se com as palavras

i stand before the sea, before its waves,
before the tides stirred by september, before the grays
and blues that alternate with strange greens;
a voice speaks of madness, or of the empty gaze
of fish, or of a topic dried up like seaweed
at low tide; a wind swept the beach
in the silence of afternoon, restoring an ancient unity
to the body of the waters. the sea, meanwhile, thinks
it has been forgotten. its depths guard the images
no longer preserved in dreams, arms that grasp
onto shipwrecked masts. an abstract ship
sails slowly over the horizon that the morning didn’t see,
passing to the other side of the earth, oblivious
for the time being to the music of the ports. the poem,
i was told, didn’t notice this distraction: it crossed
the boundary of eternity, donned nocturnal
words, and allowed death to contaminate it.

all of its contradictions.",pt_XX,en_XX,"Ethical
I arrive in front of the sea, of their waves,
from the tides that september enrages, from the childness

A voice cares of crazy, or empty eyes
of the fishes, or of a resequite thing like the seaweeds
From the flow tide; a wind traversed the beach,
In the silence of the afternoon, returning to the body of the waters
An old unity. the sea, however, supposes
May you forget it. In your backsides the images sleep
that the dream doesn't keep anymore; arms that grab on
To the masters of the ship. An abstract ship
Slowly passed through the horizon that the morning didn't see,
Going into the other side of the earth, forgotten
For moments of the music of the ports. The poem, they told me,
You've ignored this distraction: You've traversed
The end of eternity, dressed with the words
Nocturns, let death contaminate it.

Slowly, replaining in a slow voice
All of your contradictions."

quando colhi os frutos daqueles ramos
que nunca deram sombra, a noite desceu
depressa, sem poente nem crepúsculo: a noite
que já estava dentro de cada fruto
e se fazia mais espessa de cada vez que os meus lábios
tocavam a ácida casca. que noite
começou então? não foi, sem dúvida, a noite
áspera do choro e do canto; nem a noite piedosa
que antecede a madrugada; nem sequer
a noite única do sonho e da insónia, confundindo-se
no curso sonâmbulo dos corpos que o torpor amante
contamina. noite sem fim – porque
não teve um princípio – e definitiva no olhar
cego de um reflexo sem memória: dando
o nome às coisas que nunca o tiveram; e roubando
substância a esses nomes – essa noite
anda pelo meio de mim, entre quem sou
e quem julgo ser, impedindo-me de ver cada um
dos lados em que estou. noite, então,
que caiu onde sempre esteve: amada, desejada,
repudiada repetição do que escrevo
quando escrevo – chamando, apenas,
a chama que não vejo nesse obscuro desejo.","homage to st john of the cross
when i plucked the fruit from those branches
that had never given shade, night fell
quickly, with no sunset or twilight – a night
already present in each fruit
and thicker each time my lips
touched their acid skin. what night
was in progress? surely not the bleak night
of weeping and song, nor the compassionate
night that precedes dawn, nor even
that singular night of dream and insomnia, confounded
in the hypnotic conduct of bodies ruled
by love’s torpor. a night without end, since
it had no beginning, definitive in its blind
stare, a reflection without memory that names
what had been nameless, and from the names
takes substance – this night runs
through the middle of me, between who i am
and who i think i am, preventing me from seeing either
of the sides i occupy. a night that fell, therefore,
where it had always been: a beloved, desired,
rejected repetition of what i describe
whenever i write – the fire i call
but do not see in that dark desire.",pt_XX,en_XX,"Tribute to Saint John of the Cross
When I hold the fruits of those boughs
that never gave shadow, the night came down
Swiftly, without pont or twilight: the night
that was already inside of every fruit
And it would be Thisser every time than my lips
They'd touch the sour shoulder. What a night.
it started then? it was not, not, the night
Hard of crying and singing; not even the pityful night
that before the night; not even
The unique night of dream and insomnia, confusing
In the sleep course of the bodys that torpor love
Contained. Endless night – because
You didn't have a prince – and final in your eyes
A blind of a memoryless reflex: giving
the name to the things that never had it; and swiping
Substance to these names – this night
It's in the middle of me, whom I am
And who I think to be, stopping me from seeing everyone
On the side I'm on. night, so,
that falls where it's always been: loved, desired,
Repudiate repetition of what I write
When I write – calling, just,
The flame that I don't see in this dark desire."

despe-te de verdades
das grandes primeiro que das pequenas
das tuas antes que de quaisquer outras

a teu lado
primeiro as que te impuseram eras ainda imbele
e não possuías mácula senão a de um nome estranho
depois as que crescendo penosamente vestiste
a verdade do pão a verdade das lágrimas
pois não és flor nem luto nem acalanto nem estrela
depois as que ganhaste com o teu sémen
onde a manhã ergue um espelho vazio
e uma criança chora entre nuvens e abismos

quando lhes forneceres a grande recordação
que todos esperam tanto porque a esperam de ti

a lad with a great future
strip yourself of truths
the great before the small
your own before any others
dig a pit and bury them
at your side
first those that they imposed on you when you were still a docile child
and had no stain except for that of a strange name
then those that as you grew you painfully put on
the truth of bread the truth of tears
for you are neither flower nor mourning nor consolation nor star
then those you won with your semen
where the morning raises high an empty mirror
and a child cries between clouds and an abyss
then those they’re going to place above your portrait
when you provide them with the great remembrance
they all expect so anxiously expecting it of you
then nothing, just you and your silence
and veins of coral tearing at our wrists
and now, my lord, we can proceed across
the naked plains
your body with clouds upon its shoulders
my hands full with a white beard
there, there will be no delay no shelter no arrival
just a square of fire above our heads
a street of stone to the end of the lights
and the silence of death as we pass",pt_XX,en_XX,"Tell to the Prince of Epaminendes,

Then them you won with your semen
Where the morning up an empty mirror
And a child cries atween clouds and abysmoses
And them that are to be put on top of your portrait

that everyone waits so much because they waits for you
Nothing after, just you and your silence
And coral veins rivening our pulces

"das coisas
nem todas as coisas marcam para nós
o tempo com tenacidade, nos seus halos.
muitas ocultam ou não nos devolvem
o pensamento com que as havíamos querido.

ó tanque que conténs a história do tempo,
hora a hora nas quatro estações.
tens o inverno, o verão, a primavera
e sobretudo o outono perfeito, tão imóvel.
e o miósporo e a ameixoeira
não só te dão as imagens da imagem
como te lançam as pétalas soltas
para que o arquétipo tombe sobre a imagem.
e não apenas do reino vegetal as figuras
visitam o teu espelho, ó tanque antigo,
como os peixes, as aves e os insectos
passam, no inteiro tempo em que tu guardas
os sinais do passado e do presente.
tanta coisa passou sem me lembrar
que passamos, só esta água
parada no seu círculo e a escorrer
tem uma força móvel e imóvel
que me puxa de idade para idade.
continuamente jorra, e sai pela caleira
rasa ao chão, espalhada nos terrenos.
e o tempo vai-se gastando como a água
que nunca tem em si o mesmo espelho
para as imagens vindas e perdidas.","on things
not all things mark time for us

you have winter, summer and spring
to show, and perfect, motionless autumn.
the plum tree and the windstay bush
give you not only images of the image
but also their fallen petals,
so that the archetype overlies the image.
and not only from the plant kingdom,
o ancient tank, do figures visit your mirror;
fishes, birds and insects pass
in the whole time where you preserve
the signs of the past and present.
so many things have passed, and yet i forget
that we pass, that only this water
enclosed in its circle and flowing
has a mobile and immobile force
that pulls me from age to age.

at ground level, spreading over the fields.
