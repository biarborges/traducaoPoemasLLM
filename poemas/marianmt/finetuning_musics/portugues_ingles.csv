"o sonho da linguagem
escreverás sobre a sujeição dos animais.
mas não hoje. lembra-te de como se move
a pantera, ainda, na jaula sem literatura
que lhe legaram. lembrar-te-ás. mas não hoje.
porque hoje é o dia em que as metáforas
despertam, a arca se abre, e a linguagem
se assemelha a uma invenção em aberto.
uma vigília de metáforas preenchendo a noite,
como um fogo-de-santelmo que, eternamente,
a cobrisse, a si e ao seu manto e aos seus símbolos.
hoje é o dia em que a noite se faz dia,
em que a linguagem celebra os animais
depois dos animais terem perecido,
mas sem que haja memória disso,
sequer nostalgia disso. apenas linguagem,
apenas sentido e som a ressoar dentro
do sentido, sem que a hipótese de um princípio
se imponha, sem que a hipótese de um fim se imponha.
haverás de despertar, tu também,
para a vigília das metáforas,
para o sonho da linguagem.","the dream of language
you’ll write about the subjection of animals.
but not today. remember how the panther
still moves in the literature-free cage
it inherited. you’ll remember. but not today.
because today’s the day when metaphors
awaken, the chest opens up, and language
resembles an invention in progress.
a vigil of metaphors filling up the night,
as if it and its mantle and its symbols
were covered by an eternal saint elmo’s fire.
today’s the day when night becomes day,
when language celebrates animals
after the animals have perished
but with no trace of them surviving
in memory or in longing. just language,
just meaning and sound echoing inside
meaning, with no possibility of a beginning
asserting itself, no possibility of an end.
you too will have to wake up
to the vigil of metaphors,
to the dream of language.",pt_XX,en_XX,"The dream of the word

Wake up, the ark opens, and the word
it resembles to an open creation.
A vigil of metaphorus full the night,
just like a saintly fire that, forever,
the cobrise, to you and to your manor and to your symons.
today is the day when the night becomes day,
in which the word happeness the animal
After the animal has been died,
But without a memory of this,
I don't even nostalgia of this. It's just words,
just sense and sound that resonate inside
of the sense, without the hypothesis of a principle
it imposes, without the chance of an end imposes it.
You'll have to wake up, so are you,
to the vigil of the metaphorus,
For the dream of the word."

na hora em que eu mais ruía
o sol aplainava o relvado, palmeiras
ondulavam num lago turvo
longe o escaravelho porvindoiro
que as reduziu a um coto
assemelhando-as a um ananás que degrada hoje
pelos jardins
o repuxo animava sem triunfo o pântano
da juventude
as varandas em fogo
o verão começando pelo fim
horas extraordinárias aquelas
em que as aves adiavam o repouso por causa
dos insectos do turno sequente
ourados absortos estrepitantes
a hora em que mais ninguém deitava como eu
a bicicleta sobre a falta
e se sentava na relva prendendo as lágrimas
as mãos tapando o rosto o rosto entre os geolhos e uma
roda atrás a girar
não havia o ecrã de bolso oportuno
era inevitável encarar o que não tem conserto
nem nunca terá
era do dia o instante altíloquo
uma harmónica crepitava nos auscultadores
feria de morte o touro da tarde
esse búfalo ermo que se aparta da manada
para ficar-se
os subidos candeeiros acendiam
havia um muro recém pintado
sujo já por um grafito de província
um cão passava ao largo levantava o focinho ao
perfume dos jantares
que chegava de onde
se entrevia o espalha-cor dos televisores
havia o farrapo de lua
como flanela posta sobre a ganga das alturas
agraudava os dós arrumados
na caixa do futuro
a hédera das extensões percorria aquela hora
uma ideia sulcava a charneca celeste
o coração alpinista no avesso dos volumes
rarefeito
o mundo era já uma seara de nojo
e fartura – belo desastroso feroz – lugar de forças
e destruições
eu tacteava de olhos fechados
puro intrínseco
procurava um celeiro urbano onde guardar
o ouro-sémen pronto a detonar
a libélula extrema o grilo inicial
a andorinha cujo ninho resulta de um cúmulo
de lama e ervas secas e rasoira
as superfícies alimentando-se no ar
nas minhas costas o exíguo refrigério
da biblioteca pública
àquela hora antro de nebulosos soldados
repousando da luta de guerrilha
hasta la derrota, siempre!
infligiam estragos mínimos a um inimigo
bronco mas relutante
apenas tombavam nas emboscadas aqueles
como eu mais sorumbáticos
tanto oito visível ainda sobre o chão
lavrado à força de rodar no mesmo sítio
ousara trespassar o pórtico do infinito
finava sempre inclinado sobre o jantar","[neil young]
that moment when i was really falling apart
and the sun lingered over the lawn, and the palms
billowed above the turbid lake
faraway the promised beetle
reduced those palms to a stump
until they seemed like a pineapple which these days
rots in the gardens
the fountain blandly animated the swamp
of the young
the balconies on fire
the summer beginning at its end
overtime hours those
in which the birds delayed their naps because
of the next shift of insects
hallucinating self-absorbed clamorous
at that hour no one else like me setting their bicycle
down on the dearth
sitting on the grass holding back tears
covering their face with their hands, face between their knees and a
wheel behind still spinning
there was no convenient pocket screen
facing up to that which can’t be fixed and never will be
was inevitable
it was on that day the eloquent moment
a harmonica crackled in my headphones
mortally wounding the afternoon’s bull
that solitary buffalo that steers clear of the herd
to die
the high lamps lit up
a newly painted wall
already marked with a small town’s graffito
a dog went past lifting its snout to the
scent of dinners
which came from where
the televisions’ color-blend rose in the air
there was the shred of moon
like flannel sewn onto the denim of the heights
it nurtured hoarded hurt
in the box of the future
the ivy of extensions twined through that hour
an idea furrowed the celestial fen
the mountaineer heart inside the volumes
rarefied
the world was already a glebe of lamentation
and overabundance – beautiful disastrous fierce – locus of forces
and ruin
i fingered with my eyes closed
pure intrinsic
searched out an urban granary where i could keep
the semen-gold ready to detonate
the extreme dragonfly the first cricket
the swallow who got up its nest in a cumulus
of mud and dried weeds who smooths
the surfaces feeding itself in the air
at my back the exiguous cooling
of the public library
at that hour a cavern of nebulous soldiers
resting from their war of resistance
hasta la derrota, siempre!
they inflicted little damage on a rough
but reluctant enemy
only those as sullen as i
walked into ambushes
so many figure eights still visible on the ground

"para a educação sentimental
tantas vezes se vive de uma arrebatada
noção dos contrastes mais fortes entre o bem e o
mal, entre a grandeza e a abjecção, entre as rápidas
peripécias de um heroísmo ansioso e o destino inexorável,
que o melodrama é da nossa mais funda natureza,
nostálgica, obscuramente nostálgica do coração radical,
do que vai à desfilada nos sonhos contraditórios,
do que engendra imagens capciosas e julga viver em liberdade,
mas é só imprudente e explosivo, mas esbarra
nas malhas deste mundo, nos imprevistos
da traição e da morte, ou tem de renunciar perante os rasgos
mais sublimes. a paixão dilacera bruscamente as personagens
apegadas à felicidade, os obstáculos
também têm protagonistas, ajustes de contas, cruéis fulgores,
perseguições, e nos casos desvairados de amor não há saída.
desse falhanço insuportável nasce o melodrama,
lírico, incontido, entre golfadas de espiral vertiginosa
com o sangue e a memória, com o que não tem remédio e a música trágica,
em que alguém vai morrer, alguém se perde alucinado,
e alguém se salva e porventura alguém escreve
a história e alguém lhe junta a música
para as emoções serem mais opressivas e talvez mais devoradoras
e mais fáceis, e alguém tem o desejo disso, um estremecimento
de arrepio e vulgaridade, um ávido prazer inconfessado.","sentimental education
we often live according to a rash
notion of stark contrasts between good
and evil, greatness and wretchedness, the swift deeds
of an avid heroism and the inexorable march of destiny,
melodrama being part of our deepest nature,
obscurely but stubbornly nostalgic for the radical heart,
which races at top speed in contradictory dreams,
which engenders seductive images and thinks it lives in freedom,
but it’s merely reckless and explosive, it stumbles
into the world’s snares, into unexpected
treachery and death, or it must renounce in the face of the most
sublime flashes. passion rudely lacerates people
attached to happiness. the obstacles we meet
also have protagonists, scores to settle, cruel splendors,
feverish pursuits. and in desperate cases of love there’s no way out.
from that unbearable failure is born lyrical, unbridled
melodrama, amid whirling, dizzying spurts
of blood and memory, of dashed hopes and tragic music,
in which someone dies, someone goes mad,
and someone is saved, and maybe someone writes down
the story, and someone else adds music
for the emotions to be more oppressive and perhaps more consuming
and facile, and someone desires this, it makes someone feel a shiver
of tingling banality, a voracious and unconfessed thrill.",pt_XX,en_XX,"it's for the midnessal education
it's so many times, it's living from a blind
a notion of the strongest contrasts between well and well
It's bad, between greatness and abjection, between the fast

That melodrama is of our deepest nature,
Nostalgic, darkly nostalgic of the radical heart,
of what goes to the party in the adverstory dreams,
of what begets captius images and thinks to live in freedom,
But it's just unruly and explosive, but it starts
in the nets of this world, in the unprevented
of treason and of death, or have to resign in front of the tides
More sublime. passion hurtly deceives the charls
closed to happiness, the obstacles
They've also have starences, adjustments of accounts, cruel flashes,
persecutions, and in white case of love, there is no out.
from this insufferable failure the melodrama is born,
Lyric, uncontained, between gloves of vertiginal spiral
With the blood and the memory, with what there has no remedium and the tragical music,
When someone is going to die, someone is lost hallucinate,
And someone saves and someone writes
The story and someone adds to the music
so the emotions can be more opressive and maybe more eyesting
And easier, and someone has the desire of that, a quiver
girl and vulgarity, an avid pleasure unconfessed."

They ask the cupid, that was there,
what of the three flowers would take,
Is it smoother, purer and prettyer?
smiling, the little man would make him:
Every beautifuls are, but I wanted
Violent lily, even little rose."

exaustos e curvados,
vão um a um, curvados,

escravos condenados,

a cada golpe tremem
os que de medo tremem,
e as pálpebras me tremem
quando o açoite vibra.
estala! e apenas gemem,
pavidamente gemem,
a cada golpe gemem,
que os desequilibra.
sob o açoite caem,
a cada golpe caem,
erguem-se logo. caem,
soergue-os o terror...
até que enfim desmaiem,
por uma vez desmaiem!
ei-los que enfim se esvaem
vencida, enfim, a dor...
e ali fiquem serenos,
de costas e serenos...
beije-os a luz, serenos,
nas amplas frontes calmas
ó céus claros e amenos,
doces jardins amenos,
onde se sofre menos,
onde dormem as almas!

the sharp and sudden pain
that stings me all of sudden,
appeared as a sudden flash,
of dazzling, dizzying white,
deranging what i saw,
costing me my vision,
causing all in view to flee,
in a gentle fading away.
it surrounded me
like a vast desert,
a vast, white desert,
vast and resplendent.
my whole being suspended,
i do not feel, i do not think,
i hover, suspended in the light....
what endless pleasure!
in the flood of light
bathing every corner of sky,
in the ecstasy of light,
i watch an endless caravan.
poor naked bodies,
reduced in the distance,
reduced and diminished
in the depths of my pupils!
on the vast plain of sand
on the distant horizon
looms the unending caravan
of immense human suffering,
eminent human suffering,
useless human suffering —
advancing with bowed heads!
bowed to the ground,
bowed and exhausted,
bowed in a single file,
march their thin figures.
condemned slaves
outlined in the sunset,
outlines of black silhouettes:
thin, wretched and vile.
those who tremble out of fear
tremble at every blow,
and i feel my eyelids tremble
whenever the whip snaps.
crack! they only moan,
drawn and pale they moan,
moan with every crack
that knocks them down.
under the whip they fall,
with every stroke they fall,
rise back up, then fall,
still struggle up, in fear,
until at last they pass out,
finally they’ve passed out!
look at them, now fainted,
their pain now defeated…
may they lie there, peaceful,
on their backs and peaceful,
and may the light caress
their broad and peaceful brows,
o clear and calm skies,
sweet calm gardens,
where the suffering is less,
where souls can rest!
the pain, a vast desert,
a vast, white desert,
vast and resplendent,
appeared as a sudden flash.
my whole being suspended,
i do not feel, i do not think,
i hover in the light, suspended
in a gentle fading away.
come swiftly, o death,
awake and come swiftly,
come swiftly to my aid,
come and wipe my sweat,

"a viagem de alexandre à índia
andaste de um ao outro lado da terra na vida interminável,
tiveste degredos, piedosos cíumes, a fé desvanescida,
amantes paradas na lavoura, roubando-te o rosto amado.
viste vestígios de que foste a sombra de ninguém,
olhos sem pudor, do reflexo dos ferros no tropel,
franjas do domínio pueril de alexandre, olhando gaugamela.
partiste num porto de transição para o levante,
com vazios para trás, todo o tempo a poder ver,
e ao primeiro inverno, pelos cardeais das suas cinzas,
começaste a travessia que não termina, a história que não acaba.
soubeste porque se vislumbra, em lágrimas, o pinheiro da juventude,
o nome quebrado num turvo ar medido sem corda,
e a maresia do vento de feição no segundo inverno.
em troca perseguiste o que rege o homem fortuito,
segredando em palácios de mármore que são apenas pedras,
dos fracassos a que jamais alguém ajoelhara.
ao terceiro inverno descobriste o hemisfério, e ao quarto,
sem ideia de guerra ou ordem para mudar o reino,
escolheste adornar os aquedutos sob o manto dos regatos,
sentado, na brisa no tanque, ao febril entardecer.
de quem te aproximaste, no seu trajecto interminado,
sem lugar senão o que esfria na mente recortada,
naquilo que se ramifica, tornando-se na própria teia,
contigo propagou o dever de passar em toda a parte.
e quando veio o quinto inverno, e o sexto, suturaste o sangue,
trouxeste a pele à curva dos rios, acolheste o que de resto se desmorona,
e pudeste enfim, na crença dos migradores furtivos, entender que
tudo se perde noutro lugar ainda, e após esse ainda noutro
e que ao fim de cada manhã noutra manhã
tudo é incerto, tão conforme o dente-de-leão no meio de searas,
tão emudecido como a veia exausta dos não sepultados.
na mansarda onde vagueia o dia e a noite
o vento responde, cortando o centeio e o calcário, e a vela
que brilha na luz de estrelas veladas, já desaparecidas,
pisadas, mudas, engolidas aos pés do sétimo inverno,
arpoa o coração e a ruína — os meridianos despem-se, voam
em vinte e cinco anos que há pouco se beijavam, e seja dito ou não dito
o prazer que inflige um pico de tormentos
por lábios que só as mulheres conhecem
no moinho das águas da morte em varanasi,
sacode a chama de quanto vale, dura e canta
o princípio e o fim do teu poder na terra.","alexandres`s travel to india
you wandered an interminable life across the earth,
suffered exile, piteous jealousy, futile faith,
labour-arrested lovers plundering your beloved’s face.
you saw traces of having been no one’s shadow,
impudent eyes, the reflection of iron on the rampage,
hints of alexander’s puerile dominance, contemplating gaugamela.
you set off from a transient port towards the levant,
leaving emptiness behind, seeing all of time,
and in the first winter, by the cardinals of its ashes,
you started the endless crossing, the incessant history.
you knew, because the pine tree of youth can be glimpsed through tears,
of the shattered name in a cloudy mood measured without ropes,
and of the favourable sea breeze in the second winter.
in exchange you pursued that which rules the fortuitous man,
whispering in marble palaces that are but stones,
failures to which no one had ever knelt.
by the third winter you discovered the hemisphere, and by the fourth,
non intent on war or order to change the kingdom,
you chose to adorn aqueducts with the mantle of streams,
sitting by the pool breeze, in the evening´s lingering fever.
whomever you approached, in their indefinite path,
without a place except that which fades inside a patchy mind,
in that which branches out and becomes the very web,
has spread with you the duty to pass through everywhere.
and by the fifth winter, and the sixth, you stitched up the blood,
brought the skin on to the river bends, welcomed that which falls apart,
and were at last capable, with the belief of a stealthy migrant, of understanding
that all is lost yet in another place, and after this in yet another
and that by the end of each morning in another morning
all is uncertain, just like a dandelion in a field of wheat,
as muted as the exhausted vein of the unburied.
in the attic where night and day roam
the wind replies, cutting the chalk and the rye, and the candle,
shimmering in the light of the veiled stars already gone,
trodden, voiceless, swallowed up by the seventh winter,
spears the heart and the ruin — the meridians undress, fly away
in twenty five years that were just kissing yesterday, and be it told or untold
the pleasure that brings a peak of torment, inflicted
by lips that only women know
in the turmoil of varanasi´s death waters,
tests the flame of the merit, endurance and song of
the beginning and the end of your power on earth.",pt_XX,en_XX,"The trip of alonexande to India
You walked from one to one side of the earth in the interminable life,
you had degrees, pityful cities, famelessed faith,
lovers stop by the labours, tasteing your loved face.
You've seen traces that you've been the shadow of anyone,
Eyes without poor, of the reflex of the fers in the tropel,
Freaks of the chieril domain of alexandre, looking gaugamela.
You left in a port of transition to the up,
With emptines back, all the time to be able to see,
And in the first winter, by the cardinals of their Ashes,
You start the traversy that doesn't end, the story that doesn't end.
You knowd because, in tears, the first of youth,
The name broken in a turbic air measured without a three,
And the seasy of the wind of affection in the second winter.
You persecuted what a fortuite man reigns,
secreting in palacys of marble that are only rocks,
from the fails that someone had never kneeled.
In the 3rd winter you discovered the hemisphere, and in the room,
Without idea of war or order to change the kingdom,
You chose to take the aqueducts which the dress of the waters,
You're smoking, in the bright in the vass, in the febrile dusk.
To those those those those those those those those those those those those those those those those those those those those those those those those were,
Without place but what colds in the corred mind,
Into thing that grows, turning into the web,
With you prophesed the obligation to go by everything.
And when the five winter came, and the six, you sutured the blood,
You brought the skin to the currow of the rivers, you hold what else falls,
And you could finally, in the believe of the furtive migrants, understand that
Everything is lost in another place still, and after that still in another place still
And that at the end of each morning in another morning
Everything is uncertain, as like the lion's teeth in the middle of nights,
It's as emudden as the exhausted vein of the unbuyed.
it's in the mezzain where the day walks and the night walks
the wind answers, slicing the rye and the calcarery, and the sail
That shines in the light of the same stars, already dissing,
foots, changes, swrapped by the feet of the 7th winter,
Arporates the heart and the ruine — the meridains hurt, fly
in tweet and five years after they kissed, and be said or not said
The pleasure that imposes a pic of torments
by lips that only women know
In the mower of the waters of death, in the waters of death, in the waters of death, in the waters of death, in the waters of death, in the waters of death, in the waters of death, in the waters of death, in the waters of death, in the waters of death, in the waters of death, in the waters of death, in the waters of death, in the waters of death, in the waters of death, in the waters of death, in the waters of death, in the waters of death, in the waters of death, in the waters of death, in the waters of death, in the waters of death, in the waters of death, in the waters of death, in the waters of death,
Shake the flame of how much worth, it sings and it sings
The beginning and the end of your power on the earth."

my hands in inward prayer, weeping!

cadeiras de napa cor de laranja
bordavam um balcão quase vazio.
numa esquina, para poder falar
olhos nos olhos, sentava-se um casal
adolescente. na testa dele – que
era dos dois o mais bonito – bailava
sozinha uma pérola de suor, sinal
de que haveria coisas difíceis para
dizer. mas, vendo bem, os tornozelos
dela eram tão finos que não iam
aguentar aquela confissão. bebi
correndo a minha água gelada para
