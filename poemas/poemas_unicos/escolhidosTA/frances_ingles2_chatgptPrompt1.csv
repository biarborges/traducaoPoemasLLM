"Votre âme est un paysage choisi
Que vont charmant masques et bergamasques
Jouant du luth et dansant et quasi
Tristes sous leurs déguisements fantasques.

Tout en chantant sur le mode mineur
L'amour vainqueur et la vie opportune
Ils n'ont pas l'air de croire à leur bonheur
Et leur chanson se mêle au clair de lune,

Au calme clair de lune triste et beau,
Qui fait rêver les oiseaux dans les arbres
Et sangloter d'extase les jets d'eau,
Les grands jets d'eau sveltes parmi les marbres.","Your soul is a chosen landscape
 On which masks and Bergamasques cast enchantment as they go,
 Playing the lute, and dancing, and all but
 Sad beneath their fantasy-disguises.

 Singing all the while, in the minor mode,
 Of all-conquering love and life so kind to them
 They do not seem to believe in their good fortune,
 And their song mingles with the moonlight,
 
 With the calm moonlight, sad and lovely,
 Which makes the birds dream in the trees,
 And the plumes of the fountains weep in ecstasy,
 The tall, slender plumes of the fountains among the marble sculptures.",fr_XX,en_XX","Your soul is a chosen landscape
Where charming masks and bergamasks pass by,
Playing the lute and dancing, almost
Sad beneath their whimsical disguises.

Even while singing in a minor key
Of conquering love and life's fair chances,
They seem not to believe in their own joy,
And their song mingles with the moonlight,

With the still, clear moonlight, sad and lovely,
That sets the birds dreaming in the trees
And makes the fountains sob with ecstasy—
Tall, slender fountains among the marble.", "Your soul is a chosen landscape
Which charming masks and Bergamasques go
Playing the lute and dancing and almost
Sad beneath their fanciful disguises.

While singing in a minor key
Victorious love and opportune life
They don't seem to believe in their happiness
And their song mingles with the moonlight,

With the calm, sad and beautiful moonlight,
Which makes the birds dream in the trees
And the fountains sob with ecstasy,
The great, slender fountains among the marble."
