"Minha terra tem palmeiras,
Onde canta o Sabiá;
As aves, que aqui gorjeiam,
Não gorjeiam como lá.

Nosso céu tem mais estrelas,
Nossas várzeas têm mais flores,
Nossos bosques têm mais vida,
Nossa vida mais amores.

Em cismar, sozinho, à noite,
Mais prazer eu encontro lá;
Minha terra tem palmeiras,
Onde canta o Sabiá.

Minha terra tem primores,
Que tais não encontro eu cá;
Em cismar –sozinho, à noite–
Mais prazer eu encontro lá;
Minha terra tem palmeiras,
Onde canta o Sabiá.

Não permita Deus que eu morra,
Sem que eu volte para lá;
Sem que disfrute os primores
Que não encontro por cá;
Sem qu’inda aviste as palmeiras,
Onde canta o Sabiá.","My homeland has many palm-trees
and the thrush-song fills its air;
no bird here can sing as well
as the birds sing over there

We have fields more full of flowers
and a starrier sky above,
we have woods more full of life
and a life more full of love.

Lonely night-time meditations
please me more when I am there;
my homeland has many palm-trees
and the thrush-song fills its air.

Such delights as my land offers
Are not found here nor elsewhere;
lonely night-time meditations
please me more when I am there;
My homeland has many palm-trees
and the thrush-song fills its air.

Don’t allow me, God, to die
without getting back to where
I belong, without enjoying
the delights found only there,
without seeing all those palm-trees,
hearing thrush-songs fill the air.
",pt_XX,en_XX,"My land has palm trees,
Where the thrush sings;
The birds that sing here
Do not sing as they do there.

Our sky has more stars,
Our lowlands have more flowers,
Our forests have more life,
Our life more loves.

In musing, alone at night,
More pleasure I find there;
My land has palm trees,
Where the thrush sings.

My land holds wonders
That I do not find here;
In musing — alone, at night —
More pleasure I find there;
My land has palm trees,
Where the thrush sings.

May God not allow me to die
Without returning there;
Without enjoying the wonders
I do not find here;
Without still beholding the palm trees,
Where the thrush sings.","My land has palm trees,
Where the thrush sings;
The birds that chirp here,
Don't chirp like they do there.

Our sky has more stars,
Our meadows have more flowers,
Our forests have more life,
Our life more loves.

In brooding alone at night,
I find more pleasure there;
My land has palm trees,
Where the thrush sings.

My land has delights,
I don't find such here;
In brooding—alone at night—
I find more pleasure there;
My land has palm trees,
Where the thrush sings.

God forbid that I die,
Without returning there;
Without enjoying the delights
I don't find here;
Without still seeing the palm trees,
Where the thrush sings."
