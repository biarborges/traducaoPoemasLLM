"o sonho da linguagem
escreverás sobre a sujeição dos animais.
mas não hoje. lembra-te de como se move
a pantera, ainda, na jaula sem literatura
que lhe legaram. lembrar-te-ás. mas não hoje.
porque hoje é o dia em que as metáforas
despertam, a arca se abre, e a linguagem
se assemelha a uma invenção em aberto.
uma vigília de metáforas preenchendo a noite,
como um fogo-de-santelmo que, eternamente,
a cobrisse, a si e ao seu manto e aos seus símbolos.
hoje é o dia em que a noite se faz dia,
em que a linguagem celebra os animais
depois dos animais terem perecido,
mas sem que haja memória disso,
sequer nostalgia disso. apenas linguagem,
apenas sentido e som a ressoar dentro
do sentido, sem que a hipótese de um princípio
se imponha, sem que a hipótese de um fim se imponha.

para o sonho da linguagem.","the dream of language

resembles an invention in progress.
a vigil of metaphors filling up the night,
as if it and its mantle and its symbols
were covered by an eternal saint elmo’s fire.
today’s the day when night becomes day,
when language celebrates animals
after the animals have perished
but with no trace of them surviving
in memory or in longing. just language,
just meaning and sound echoing inside

na hora em que eu mais ruía
o sol aplainava o relvado, palmeiras
ondulavam num lago turvo
longe o escaravelho porvindoiro
que as reduziu a um coto
assemelhando-as a um ananás que degrada hoje
pelos jardins
o repuxo animava sem triunfo o pântano
da juventude
as varandas em fogo
o verão começando pelo fim
horas extraordinárias aquelas
em que as aves adiavam o repouso por causa
dos insectos do turno sequente
ourados absortos estrepitantes
a hora em que mais ninguém deitava como eu
a bicicleta sobre a falta
e se sentava na relva prendendo as lágrimas
as mãos tapando o rosto o rosto entre os geolhos e uma
roda atrás a girar
não havia o ecrã de bolso oportuno
era inevitável encarar o que não tem conserto
nem nunca terá
era do dia o instante altíloquo
uma harmónica crepitava nos auscultadores
feria de morte o touro da tarde
esse búfalo ermo que se aparta da manada
para ficar-se
os subidos candeeiros acendiam
havia um muro recém pintado
sujo já por um grafito de província
um cão passava ao largo levantava o focinho ao
perfume dos jantares
que chegava de onde
se entrevia o espalha-cor dos televisores
havia o farrapo de lua
como flanela posta sobre a ganga das alturas
agraudava os dós arrumados
na caixa do futuro
a hédera das extensões percorria aquela hora
uma ideia sulcava a charneca celeste
o coração alpinista no avesso dos volumes
rarefeito
o mundo era já uma seara de nojo
e fartura – belo desastroso feroz – lugar de forças
e destruições
eu tacteava de olhos fechados
puro intrínseco
procurava um celeiro urbano onde guardar
o ouro-sémen pronto a detonar
a libélula extrema o grilo inicial
a andorinha cujo ninho resulta de um cúmulo
de lama e ervas secas e rasoira
as superfícies alimentando-se no ar
nas minhas costas o exíguo refrigério
da biblioteca pública
àquela hora antro de nebulosos soldados
repousando da luta de guerrilha
hasta la derrota, siempre!
infligiam estragos mínimos a um inimigo
bronco mas relutante
apenas tombavam nas emboscadas aqueles
como eu mais sorumbáticos
tanto oito visível ainda sobre o chão
lavrado à força de rodar no mesmo sítio

that moment when i was really falling apart
and the sun lingered over the lawn, and the palms
billowed above the turbid lake
faraway the promised beetle
reduced those palms to a stump
until they seemed like a pineapple which these days
rots in the gardens
the fountain blandly animated the swamp
of the young
the balconies on fire
the summer beginning at its end
overtime hours those
in which the birds delayed their naps because
of the next shift of insects
hallucinating self-absorbed clamorous
at that hour no one else like me setting their bicycle
down on the dearth
sitting on the grass holding back tears
covering their face with their hands, face between their knees and a
wheel behind still spinning
there was no convenient pocket screen
facing up to that which can’t be fixed and never will be
was inevitable
it was on that day the eloquent moment
a harmonica crackled in my headphones
mortally wounding the afternoon’s bull
that solitary buffalo that steers clear of the herd
to die
the high lamps lit up
a newly painted wall
already marked with a small town’s graffito
a dog went past lifting its snout to the
scent of dinners
which came from where
the televisions’ color-blend rose in the air
there was the shred of moon
like flannel sewn onto the denim of the heights
it nurtured hoarded hurt
in the box of the future
the ivy of extensions twined through that hour
an idea furrowed the celestial fen
the mountaineer heart inside the volumes
rarefied
the world was already a glebe of lamentation
and overabundance – beautiful disastrous fierce – locus of forces
and ruin
i fingered with my eyes closed
pure intrinsic
searched out an urban granary where i could keep
the semen-gold ready to detonate
the extreme dragonfly the first cricket
the swallow who got up its nest in a cumulus
of mud and dried weeds who smooths
the surfaces feeding itself in the air
at my back the exiguous cooling
of the public library
at that hour a cavern of nebulous soldiers
resting from their war of resistance
hasta la derrota, siempre!
they inflicted little damage on a rough
but reluctant enemy

walked into ambushes

"o corpo espacejado
perdia-se-lhe o corpo no deserto, que dentro dele aos poucos conquistava um espaço cada vez maior, novos contornos, novas posições, e lhe envolvia os órgãos que, isolados nas areias, adquiriam uma reverberação particular. ia-se de dia para dia espacejando. as várias partes de que só por abstracção se chegava à noção de um todo começavam a afastar-se umas das outras, de forma que entre elas não tardou que espumejassem as marés e a própria via-láctea principiasse a abrir caminho. a sua carne exercia aliás uma enigmática atracção sobre as estrelas, que em breve conseguiu assimilar, exibindo-as, aos olhos de quem o não soubesse, como luminosas cicatrizes cujo brilho, transmutado em sangue, lentamente se esvaía. ele mais não era, nessas ocasiões, do que um morrão, nas cinzas do qual, quase imperceptível, se podia no entanto detectar ainda a palpitação das vísceras, que a mais pequena alteração na direcção do vento era capaz de pôr de novo a funcionar. resolveu então plastificar-se. principiou pelas extremidades, pelos dedos das mãos e pelos pés, mas passado pouco tempo eram já os pulmões, os intestinos e o coração o que minuciosamente ele embrulhava em celofane, contra o qual as ondas produziam um ruído
aterrador.","the strewn body
his body was getting lost in the desert, which kept gaining more ground and redefining its borders inside him, causing his organs, isolated by the surrounding sands, to reverberate in a strange new way. day by day he was getting more strewn out. the various parts of what could only abstractly be conceived as a whole were beginning to spread apart, such that the ocean tides were soon foaming between them, and the milky way itself started cutting through. his flesh, in fact, exerted an enigmatic attraction on the stars, which in due course it managed to assimilate, exhibiting them (to the unknowing) as so many luminous scars whose glow, transformed into blood, slowly dwindled. on these occasions he was no more than an ember among the ashes, though one could still make out the faint throbbing of his guts, apt to be quickened by the slightest change in the wind’s direction. so he decided on a plastic-coated self. he began with his extremities, his fingers and feet, but soon he was meticulously wrapping his lungs, intestines and heart in cellophane, against which the waves made a frightful sound.",pt_XX,en_XX,"the spaced-out body

"para a educação sentimental
tantas vezes se vive de uma arrebatada
noção dos contrastes mais fortes entre o bem e o
mal, entre a grandeza e a abjecção, entre as rápidas
peripécias de um heroísmo ansioso e o destino inexorável,
que o melodrama é da nossa mais funda natureza,
nostálgica, obscuramente nostálgica do coração radical,
do que vai à desfilada nos sonhos contraditórios,
do que engendra imagens capciosas e julga viver em liberdade,
mas é só imprudente e explosivo, mas esbarra
nas malhas deste mundo, nos imprevistos
da traição e da morte, ou tem de renunciar perante os rasgos
mais sublimes. a paixão dilacera bruscamente as personagens
apegadas à felicidade, os obstáculos
também têm protagonistas, ajustes de contas, cruéis fulgores,
perseguições, e nos casos desvairados de amor não há saída.
desse falhanço insuportável nasce o melodrama,
lírico, incontido, entre golfadas de espiral vertiginosa
com o sangue e a memória, com o que não tem remédio e a música trágica,
em que alguém vai morrer, alguém se perde alucinado,
e alguém se salva e porventura alguém escreve
a história e alguém lhe junta a música
para as emoções serem mais opressivas e talvez mais devoradoras
e mais fáceis, e alguém tem o desejo disso, um estremecimento
de arrepio e vulgaridade, um ávido prazer inconfessado.","sentimental education
we often live according to a rash
notion of stark contrasts between good
and evil, greatness and wretchedness, the swift deeds
of an avid heroism and the inexorable march of destiny,
melodrama being part of our deepest nature,
obscurely but stubbornly nostalgic for the radical heart,
which races at top speed in contradictory dreams,
which engenders seductive images and thinks it lives in freedom,
but it’s merely reckless and explosive, it stumbles
into the world’s snares, into unexpected
treachery and death, or it must renounce in the face of the most
sublime flashes. passion rudely lacerates people
attached to happiness. the obstacles we meet
also have protagonists, scores to settle, cruel splendors,
feverish pursuits. and in desperate cases of love there’s no way out.
from that unbearable failure is born lyrical, unbridled
melodrama, amid whirling, dizzying spurts
of blood and memory, of dashed hopes and tragic music,
in which someone dies, someone goes mad,
and someone is saved, and maybe someone writes down
the story, and someone else adds music
for the emotions to be more oppressive and perhaps more consuming
and facile, and someone desires this, it makes someone feel a shiver
of tingling banality, a voracious and unconfessed thrill.",pt_XX,en_XX,"for sentimental education, we often live with an overwhelming notion of the strongest contrasts between good and evil, between greatness and abjection, between the rapid adventures of an anxious heroism and inexorable destiny, that melodrama is of our deepest nature, nostalgic, obscurely nostalgic of the radical heart, of what parades in contradictory dreams, of what engenders captious images and believes it lives in freedom, but is only imprudent and explosive, but comes up against the nets of this world, the unforeseen events of betrayal and death, or has to give up in the face of the most sublime flashes. passion abruptly tears apart the characters attached to happiness, obstacles also have protagonists, settling of accounts, cruel flashes, persecutions, and in the crazy cases of love there is no way out. from this unbearable failure comes the melodrama, lyrical, unrestrained, between gusts of a vertiginous spiral with blood and memory, with what has no remedy and tragic music, in which someone will die, someone gets lost in a hallucination, and someone is saved and perhaps someone writes the story and someone adds music to it so that the emotions are more oppressive and perhaps more devouring and easier, and someone has the desire for this, a shudder of shivering and vulgarity, an avid unconfessed pleasure."

i saw up ahead, beyond a bend in the road,
a church steeple towering above the houses of a hamlet or village.
the photographic image of that non-event has remained with me
like a horizontal wrinkle marring a trouser’s crease.
today it seems relevant...
from the road i associated that steeple with spirituality,
the faith of all ages, and practical charity.
when i arrived at the village, the steeple was a steeple
and, what’s more, there it was.

I want good, and I want evil, and in the end I want nothing.
I'm lying badly on my right, and badly on my left,
and badly on my consciousness of existing.
I'm universally ill, metaphysically ill,
but the worst thing is that my head hurts.
That's more serious than the meaning of the universe.
Once, near Oxford, on a country walk,
I saw the old tower of a church rise up from a bend in the road, in the near distance
above the houses of the village or town.
That null incident stuck in my mind,
like a transverse fold ruining the crease of trousers.
Now it comes to the point...
from the road I foresaw spirituality in that church tower
which was the faith of all ages, and effective charity.
From the town, when I got there, the church tower was the church tower,
and, what's more, it was there.
You are happy in Australia, as long as you don't go there."

"a viagem de alexandre à índia
andaste de um ao outro lado da terra na vida interminável,
tiveste degredos, piedosos cíumes, a fé desvanescida,
amantes paradas na lavoura, roubando-te o rosto amado.
viste vestígios de que foste a sombra de ninguém,
olhos sem pudor, do reflexo dos ferros no tropel,
franjas do domínio pueril de alexandre, olhando gaugamela.
partiste num porto de transição para o levante,
com vazios para trás, todo o tempo a poder ver,
e ao primeiro inverno, pelos cardeais das suas cinzas,
começaste a travessia que não termina, a história que não acaba.
soubeste porque se vislumbra, em lágrimas, o pinheiro da juventude,
o nome quebrado num turvo ar medido sem corda,
e a maresia do vento de feição no segundo inverno.
em troca perseguiste o que rege o homem fortuito,
segredando em palácios de mármore que são apenas pedras,
dos fracassos a que jamais alguém ajoelhara.
ao terceiro inverno descobriste o hemisfério, e ao quarto,
sem ideia de guerra ou ordem para mudar o reino,
escolheste adornar os aquedutos sob o manto dos regatos,
sentado, na brisa no tanque, ao febril entardecer.
de quem te aproximaste, no seu trajecto interminado,
sem lugar senão o que esfria na mente recortada,
naquilo que se ramifica, tornando-se na própria teia,
contigo propagou o dever de passar em toda a parte.
e quando veio o quinto inverno, e o sexto, suturaste o sangue,
trouxeste a pele à curva dos rios, acolheste o que de resto se desmorona,
e pudeste enfim, na crença dos migradores furtivos, entender que
tudo se perde noutro lugar ainda, e após esse ainda noutro
e que ao fim de cada manhã noutra manhã
tudo é incerto, tão conforme o dente-de-leão no meio de searas,
tão emudecido como a veia exausta dos não sepultados.
na mansarda onde vagueia o dia e a noite
o vento responde, cortando o centeio e o calcário, e a vela
que brilha na luz de estrelas veladas, já desaparecidas,
pisadas, mudas, engolidas aos pés do sétimo inverno,
arpoa o coração e a ruína — os meridianos despem-se, voam
em vinte e cinco anos que há pouco se beijavam, e seja dito ou não dito

you wandered an interminable life across the earth,
suffered exile, piteous jealousy, futile faith,
labour-arrested lovers plundering your beloved’s face.
you saw traces of having been no one’s shadow,
impudent eyes, the reflection of iron on the rampage,
hints of alexander’s puerile dominance, contemplating gaugamela.
you set off from a transient port towards the levant,
leaving emptiness behind, seeing all of time,
and in the first winter, by the cardinals of its ashes,
you started the endless crossing, the incessant history.
you knew, because the pine tree of youth can be glimpsed through tears,
of the shattered name in a cloudy mood measured without ropes,
and of the favourable sea breeze in the second winter.
in exchange you pursued that which rules the fortuitous man,
whispering in marble palaces that are but stones,
failures to which no one had ever knelt.
by the third winter you discovered the hemisphere, and by the fourth,
non intent on war or order to change the kingdom,
you chose to adorn aqueducts with the mantle of streams,
sitting by the pool breeze, in the evening´s lingering fever.
whomever you approached, in their indefinite path,
without a place except that which fades inside a patchy mind,
in that which branches out and becomes the very web,
has spread with you the duty to pass through everywhere.

brought the skin on to the river bends, welcomed that which falls apart,

its wounded wings while gasping for breath…

my hands in inward prayer, weeping!

like a white lilac whose flowers wither!

"extrema-unção
uma breve, amável mágoa à
flor dos olhos, um distante desapontamento,
morrias como se pedisses desculpa
por nos fazeres perder tempo.
tinhas pressa mas não o mostravas,
receavas que não estivéssemos preparados,
e, suspenso sobre nós, esperavas
que disséssemos tudo, que fizéssemos o apropriado.
morrer não é motivo de orgulho,
mas estavas cansado de mais para te justificares.
ainda por cima no mês de julho,
com as férias marcadas, ausentes os familiares.
tínhamos levado as crianças de casa,
feito os telefonemas, escolhido os dizeres.
o quarto fora arrumado, a cama mudada
com roupa lavada. só faltava morreres.","extreme unction
a brief and affable sorrow
surfacing in the eyes, a distant disappointment,
you died as if gently begging pardon
for making us lose time.
you were in a rush but didn’t show it,
you feared that we were not prepared,
and, hovering above us, you waited
for us to say it all, and do what needed to be done.
dying is no reason to be proud,
but you were too exhausted to explain yourself.
and worst of all, it was july,
vacations set, relatives already gone.
we had taken the children away,
made our phone calls, chosen our words.
the room was now in order, the bed remade
with freshly laundered sheets. nothing missing, but your death.",pt_XX,en_XX,"extreme unction

"tornozelos
foi na verdade a sede que me tirou
da estrada. num café de província,
cadeiras de napa cor de laranja
bordavam um balcão quase vazio.
numa esquina, para poder falar
olhos nos olhos, sentava-se um casal
adolescente. na testa dele – que
era dos dois o mais bonito – bailava
sozinha uma pérola de suor, sinal
de que haveria coisas difíceis para
dizer. mas, vendo bem, os tornozelos
dela eram tão finos que não iam
aguentar aquela confissão. bebi
correndo a minha água gelada para
não atrapalhar o choro dela; e, antes
de sair, dei comigo a pensar que nem
me importaria muito de ser traída, se
pudesse ter outra vez aquela idade.","ankles

off the street. into a café, serendipitous,
orange nappa chairs
bordering an almost-empty bar.

in a corner so they could speak
face-to-face. the boy – the more
attractive of the two – had a drop
of sweat dancing down his brow, a sign
that a difficult discussion lay
ahead. but then again, her ankles
were so weak that surely they couldn’t
withstand any type of confession. i gulped

orange leather chairs
lined an almost empty counter.

eye to eye, a teenage couple sat. on his forehead - he
was the more handsome of the two - a pearl of sweat danced
alone, a sign that there would be difficult things to

hold that confession. I drank my ice-cold water
quickly so as not to disturb her crying; and, before
