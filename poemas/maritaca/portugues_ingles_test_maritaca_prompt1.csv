"o sonho da linguagem
escreverás sobre a sujeição dos animais.
mas não hoje. lembra-te de como se move
a pantera, ainda, na jaula sem literatura
que lhe legaram. lembrar-te-ás. mas não hoje.
porque hoje é o dia em que as metáforas
despertam, a arca se abre, e a linguagem
se assemelha a uma invenção em aberto.
uma vigília de metáforas preenchendo a noite,
como um fogo-de-santelmo que, eternamente,
a cobrisse, a si e ao seu manto e aos seus símbolos.
hoje é o dia em que a noite se faz dia,
em que a linguagem celebra os animais
depois dos animais terem perecido,
mas sem que haja memória disso,
sequer nostalgia disso. apenas linguagem,
apenas sentido e som a ressoar dentro
do sentido, sem que a hipótese de um princípio
se imponha, sem que a hipótese de um fim se imponha.
haverás de despertar, tu também,
para a vigília das metáforas,
para o sonho da linguagem.","the dream of language

still moves in the literature-free cage
it inherited. you’ll remember. but not today.

awaken, the chest opens up, and language
resembles an invention in progress.
a vigil of metaphors filling up the night,
as if it and its mantle and its symbols
were covered by an eternal saint elmo’s fire.
today’s the day when night becomes day,
when language celebrates animals
after the animals have perished
but with no trace of them surviving
in memory or in longing. just language,
just meaning and sound echoing inside

asserting itself, no possibility of an end.

to the dream of language.",pt_XX,en_XX,"The dream of language

na hora em que eu mais ruía
o sol aplainava o relvado, palmeiras
ondulavam num lago turvo
longe o escaravelho porvindoiro
que as reduziu a um coto
assemelhando-as a um ananás que degrada hoje
pelos jardins
o repuxo animava sem triunfo o pântano
da juventude
as varandas em fogo
o verão começando pelo fim
horas extraordinárias aquelas
em que as aves adiavam o repouso por causa
dos insectos do turno sequente
ourados absortos estrepitantes
a hora em que mais ninguém deitava como eu
a bicicleta sobre a falta
e se sentava na relva prendendo as lágrimas
as mãos tapando o rosto o rosto entre os geolhos e uma
roda atrás a girar
não havia o ecrã de bolso oportuno
era inevitável encarar o que não tem conserto
nem nunca terá
era do dia o instante altíloquo
uma harmónica crepitava nos auscultadores
feria de morte o touro da tarde
esse búfalo ermo que se aparta da manada
para ficar-se
os subidos candeeiros acendiam
havia um muro recém pintado
sujo já por um grafito de província
um cão passava ao largo levantava o focinho ao
perfume dos jantares
que chegava de onde
se entrevia o espalha-cor dos televisores
havia o farrapo de lua
como flanela posta sobre a ganga das alturas
agraudava os dós arrumados
na caixa do futuro
a hédera das extensões percorria aquela hora
uma ideia sulcava a charneca celeste
o coração alpinista no avesso dos volumes
rarefeito
o mundo era já uma seara de nojo
e fartura – belo desastroso feroz – lugar de forças
e destruições
eu tacteava de olhos fechados
puro intrínseco
procurava um celeiro urbano onde guardar
o ouro-sémen pronto a detonar
a libélula extrema o grilo inicial
a andorinha cujo ninho resulta de um cúmulo
de lama e ervas secas e rasoira
as superfícies alimentando-se no ar
nas minhas costas o exíguo refrigério
da biblioteca pública
àquela hora antro de nebulosos soldados
repousando da luta de guerrilha
hasta la derrota, siempre!
infligiam estragos mínimos a um inimigo
bronco mas relutante
apenas tombavam nas emboscadas aqueles
como eu mais sorumbáticos

that moment when i was really falling apart
and the sun lingered over the lawn, and the palms
billowed above the turbid lake
faraway the promised beetle
reduced those palms to a stump
until they seemed like a pineapple which these days
rots in the gardens
the fountain blandly animated the swamp
of the young
the balconies on fire
the summer beginning at its end
overtime hours those
in which the birds delayed their naps because
of the next shift of insects
hallucinating self-absorbed clamorous
at that hour no one else like me setting their bicycle
down on the dearth
sitting on the grass holding back tears
covering their face with their hands, face between their knees and a
wheel behind still spinning
there was no convenient pocket screen
facing up to that which can’t be fixed and never will be
was inevitable
it was on that day the eloquent moment
a harmonica crackled in my headphones
mortally wounding the afternoon’s bull
that solitary buffalo that steers clear of the herd
to die
the high lamps lit up
a newly painted wall
already marked with a small town’s graffito
a dog went past lifting its snout to the
scent of dinners
which came from where
the televisions’ color-blend rose in the air
there was the shred of moon
like flannel sewn onto the denim of the heights
it nurtured hoarded hurt
in the box of the future
the ivy of extensions twined through that hour
an idea furrowed the celestial fen
the mountaineer heart inside the volumes
rarefied
the world was already a glebe of lamentation
and overabundance – beautiful disastrous fierce – locus of forces
and ruin
i fingered with my eyes closed
pure intrinsic
searched out an urban granary where i could keep
the semen-gold ready to detonate
the extreme dragonfly the first cricket
the swallow who got up its nest in a cumulus
of mud and dried weeds who smooths
the surfaces feeding itself in the air
at my back the exiguous cooling
of the public library
at that hour a cavern of nebulous soldiers
resting from their war of resistance
hasta la derrota, siempre!
they inflicted little damage on a rough
but reluctant enemy

walked into ambushes

always ending up bent over dinner",pt_XX,en_XX,"At the hour I was crumbling
The sun smoothed the lawn, palm trees
Waved in a murky lake

Of youth
Balconies ablaze
Summer starting at the end
Extraordinary hours those
When birds postponed their rest because of
The insects of the next shift
Gilded, noisy, absorbed
The hour when no one else laid as I did
My bike over the emptiness
And sat on the grass holding back tears
Hands covering the face, face in the arms and a wheel
Spinning behind
There was no opportune pocket screen
It was inevitable to face what has no fix
Nor ever will
It was the day's lofty moment
A harmonica crackled in the headphones
It mortally wounded the bull of the afternoon
That buffalo alone that leaves the herd
To stay
The raised streetlights lit up
There was a freshly painted wall
Already dirty by a provincial graffito
A dog passed by, lifted his muzzle to the scent of dinners
Coming from where
The spread of TV colors could be seen
There was a shroud of moon

Raked by force of revolving in the same spot

"o corpo espacejado

"para a educação sentimental
tantas vezes se vive de uma arrebatada
noção dos contrastes mais fortes entre o bem e o
mal, entre a grandeza e a abjecção, entre as rápidas
peripécias de um heroísmo ansioso e o destino inexorável,
que o melodrama é da nossa mais funda natureza,
nostálgica, obscuramente nostálgica do coração radical,
do que vai à desfilada nos sonhos contraditórios,
do que engendra imagens capciosas e julga viver em liberdade,
mas é só imprudente e explosivo, mas esbarra
nas malhas deste mundo, nos imprevistos
da traição e da morte, ou tem de renunciar perante os rasgos
mais sublimes. a paixão dilacera bruscamente as personagens
apegadas à felicidade, os obstáculos
também têm protagonistas, ajustes de contas, cruéis fulgores,
perseguições, e nos casos desvairados de amor não há saída.
desse falhanço insuportável nasce o melodrama,
lírico, incontido, entre golfadas de espiral vertiginosa
com o sangue e a memória, com o que não tem remédio e a música trágica,
em que alguém vai morrer, alguém se perde alucinado,
e alguém se salva e porventura alguém escreve
a história e alguém lhe junta a música
para as emoções serem mais opressivas e talvez mais devoradoras
e mais fáceis, e alguém tem o desejo disso, um estremecimento
de arrepio e vulgaridade, um ávido prazer inconfessado.","sentimental education
we often live according to a rash
notion of stark contrasts between good
and evil, greatness and wretchedness, the swift deeds
of an avid heroism and the inexorable march of destiny,
melodrama being part of our deepest nature,
obscurely but stubbornly nostalgic for the radical heart,
which races at top speed in contradictory dreams,
which engenders seductive images and thinks it lives in freedom,
but it’s merely reckless and explosive, it stumbles
into the world’s snares, into unexpected
treachery and death, or it must renounce in the face of the most
sublime flashes. passion rudely lacerates people
attached to happiness. the obstacles we meet
also have protagonists, scores to settle, cruel splendors,
feverish pursuits. and in desperate cases of love there’s no way out.
from that unbearable failure is born lyrical, unbridled
melodrama, amid whirling, dizzying spurts
of blood and memory, of dashed hopes and tragic music,
in which someone dies, someone goes mad,
and someone is saved, and maybe someone writes down
the story, and someone else adds music
for the emotions to be more oppressive and perhaps more consuming
and facile, and someone desires this, it makes someone feel a shiver
of tingling banality, a voracious and unconfessed thrill.",pt_XX,en_XX,"For sentimental education
So often one lives by an impulsive
Notion of the strongest contrasts between good and evil,
Between greatness and abjection, between the swift
Peripeties of an eager heroism and the inexorable fate,

Nostalgic, obscurely nostalgic of the radical heart,
Of what parades in contradictory dreams,
Of what engenders deceitful images and believes to live in freedom,
But is only reckless and explosive, but gets entangled
In the web of this world, in the unforeseen
Deceits and death, or must renounce before the most sublime gestures.
Passion brutally rends the characters attached to happiness,
Obstacles also have protagonists, settling of scores, cruel flashes,
Persecutions, and in the frantic cases of love there's no escape.
From this unbearable failure melodrama is born,
Lyric, unrestrained, amidst gouts of dizzying spiral
With blood and memory, with what has no remedy and tragic music,
In which someone will die, someone is lost in delirium,
And someone is saved and perchance someone writes
The story and someone adds the music
For emotions to be more oppressive and perhaps more devouring
And easier, and someone desires this, a shiver
Of goosebumps and vulgarity, a greedy pleasure unconfessed."

i saw up ahead, beyond a bend in the road,
a church steeple towering above the houses of a hamlet or village.
the photographic image of that non-event has remained with me
like a horizontal wrinkle marring a trouser’s crease.
today it seems relevant...
from the road i associated that steeple with spirituality,
the faith of all ages, and practical charity.
when i arrived at the village, the steeple was a steeple
and, what’s more, there it was.

I want good and I want evil, and in the end I want nothing.
I lie badly on the right, and badly on the left,
and badly lie upon the conscience of existing.
I am universally bad, metaphysically bad,
but the worst is that my head hurts.
This is more serious than the meaning of the universe.
Once, near Oxford, on a country walk,
I saw rise from a bend in the road, in the near distance
the old tower of a church above village houses or town.
This incident remained photographic for me
like a crosswise crease spoiling the fold of trousers.
Now it comes to mind...
From the road, I foresaw spirituality in that church tower
which was the faith of all ages, and the effective charity.
Upon arriving at the village, the church tower was just the church tower,
and, to top it all, it was there.
One is happy in Australia, provided one does not go there."

"a viagem de alexandre à índia
andaste de um ao outro lado da terra na vida interminável,
tiveste degredos, piedosos cíumes, a fé desvanescida,
amantes paradas na lavoura, roubando-te o rosto amado.
viste vestígios de que foste a sombra de ninguém,
olhos sem pudor, do reflexo dos ferros no tropel,
franjas do domínio pueril de alexandre, olhando gaugamela.
partiste num porto de transição para o levante,
com vazios para trás, todo o tempo a poder ver,
e ao primeiro inverno, pelos cardeais das suas cinzas,
começaste a travessia que não termina, a história que não acaba.
soubeste porque se vislumbra, em lágrimas, o pinheiro da juventude,
o nome quebrado num turvo ar medido sem corda,
e a maresia do vento de feição no segundo inverno.
em troca perseguiste o que rege o homem fortuito,
segredando em palácios de mármore que são apenas pedras,
dos fracassos a que jamais alguém ajoelhara.
ao terceiro inverno descobriste o hemisfério, e ao quarto,
sem ideia de guerra ou ordem para mudar o reino,
escolheste adornar os aquedutos sob o manto dos regatos,
sentado, na brisa no tanque, ao febril entardecer.
de quem te aproximaste, no seu trajecto interminado,
sem lugar senão o que esfria na mente recortada,
naquilo que se ramifica, tornando-se na própria teia,
contigo propagou o dever de passar em toda a parte.
e quando veio o quinto inverno, e o sexto, suturaste o sangue,
trouxeste a pele à curva dos rios, acolheste o que de resto se desmorona,
e pudeste enfim, na crença dos migradores furtivos, entender que
tudo se perde noutro lugar ainda, e após esse ainda noutro
e que ao fim de cada manhã noutra manhã
tudo é incerto, tão conforme o dente-de-leão no meio de searas,
tão emudecido como a veia exausta dos não sepultados.
na mansarda onde vagueia o dia e a noite
o vento responde, cortando o centeio e o calcário, e a vela
que brilha na luz de estrelas veladas, já desaparecidas,
pisadas, mudas, engolidas aos pés do sétimo inverno,
arpoa o coração e a ruína — os meridianos despem-se, voam
em vinte e cinco anos que há pouco se beijavam, e seja dito ou não dito
o prazer que inflige um pico de tormentos
por lábios que só as mulheres conhecem
no moinho das águas da morte em varanasi,
sacode a chama de quanto vale, dura e canta
o princípio e o fim do teu poder na terra.","alexandres`s travel to india
you wandered an interminable life across the earth,
suffered exile, piteous jealousy, futile faith,
labour-arrested lovers plundering your beloved’s face.
you saw traces of having been no one’s shadow,
impudent eyes, the reflection of iron on the rampage,
hints of alexander’s puerile dominance, contemplating gaugamela.
you set off from a transient port towards the levant,
leaving emptiness behind, seeing all of time,
and in the first winter, by the cardinals of its ashes,
you started the endless crossing, the incessant history.
you knew, because the pine tree of youth can be glimpsed through tears,
of the shattered name in a cloudy mood measured without ropes,
and of the favourable sea breeze in the second winter.
in exchange you pursued that which rules the fortuitous man,
whispering in marble palaces that are but stones,
failures to which no one had ever knelt.
by the third winter you discovered the hemisphere, and by the fourth,
non intent on war or order to change the kingdom,
you chose to adorn aqueducts with the mantle of streams,
sitting by the pool breeze, in the evening´s lingering fever.
whomever you approached, in their indefinite path,
without a place except that which fades inside a patchy mind,
in that which branches out and becomes the very web,
has spread with you the duty to pass through everywhere.
and by the fifth winter, and the sixth, you stitched up the blood,
brought the skin on to the river bends, welcomed that which falls apart,
and were at last capable, with the belief of a stealthy migrant, of understanding
that all is lost yet in another place, and after this in yet another
and that by the end of each morning in another morning
all is uncertain, just like a dandelion in a field of wheat,
as muted as the exhausted vein of the unburied.
in the attic where night and day roam
the wind replies, cutting the chalk and the rye, and the candle,
shimmering in the light of the veiled stars already gone,
trodden, voiceless, swallowed up by the seventh winter,
spears the heart and the ruin — the meridians undress, fly away
in twenty five years that were just kissing yesterday, and be it told or untold
the pleasure that brings a peak of torment, inflicted
by lips that only women know
in the turmoil of varanasi´s death waters,
tests the flame of the merit, endurance and song of
the beginning and the end of your power on earth.",pt_XX,en_XX,"The journey of alexander to india

fringes of the boyish dominion of alexander, watching gaugamela.

and to the first winter, by the cardinal points of his ashes,

high sea! vanquished waves
breaking with whispered, troubled sighs…
immaculate, weightless flight of gulls,
like snows appearing on the hilltops!
sun! a bird falling, still flapping
its wounded wings while gasping for breath…
to you, sweet tortured sunset, i lift
my hands in inward prayer, weeping!
o my charming verse of samain,
not yet daylight, already you’re moonlight,
like a white lilac whose flowers wither!
love! i carry your heart in my breast…
it pounds within me like this sea
in an endless, never withering kiss!...",pt_XX,en_XX,"from my window

in a desperate and murmuring sob...
flight of seagulls, light, immaculate,

oh my tormented sunset
I pray to you within, weeping, hands raised!
my verse of samain full of grace,
you're not yet a bright light, you're already moonlight
like a white lilac that fades away!

pulses within me like this sea
in an eternal kiss, thus, never undone!..."
"extrema-unção
uma breve, amável mágoa à
flor dos olhos, um distante desapontamento,
morrias como se pedisses desculpa
por nos fazeres perder tempo.
tinhas pressa mas não o mostravas,
receavas que não estivéssemos preparados,
e, suspenso sobre nós, esperavas
que disséssemos tudo, que fizéssemos o apropriado.
morrer não é motivo de orgulho,
mas estavas cansado de mais para te justificares.
ainda por cima no mês de julho,
com as férias marcadas, ausentes os familiares.
tínhamos levado as crianças de casa,
feito os telefonemas, escolhido os dizeres.
o quarto fora arrumado, a cama mudada
com roupa lavada. só faltava morreres.","extreme unction
a brief and affable sorrow
surfacing in the eyes, a distant disappointment,
you died as if gently begging pardon
for making us lose time.
you were in a rush but didn’t show it,
you feared that we were not prepared,
and, hovering above us, you waited
for us to say it all, and do what needed to be done.
dying is no reason to be proud,
but you were too exhausted to explain yourself.
and worst of all, it was july,
vacations set, relatives already gone.
we had taken the children away,
made our phone calls, chosen our words.
the room was now in order, the bed remade
with freshly laundered sheets. nothing missing, but your death.",pt_XX,en_XX,"last rites
a brief, amiable sorrow at
the bloom of the eyes, a distant letdown,
you died as if apologizing
for wasting our time.
you were in a hurry but didn't show it,
you feared we were not ready,
and, suspended above us, you waited
for us to say everything, to do what was right.
dying is not a matter of pride,
but you were too weary to explain yourself.
and even in the month of july,
with vacations scheduled, family absent.
we had taken the children out of the house,
made the phone calls, chosen the words.
the room had been tidied, the bed changed
with clean linens. all that was left was for you to die."

"a infancia da herberto helder
no princípio era a ilha

o espírito de deus

é um tumulto

precisos

"tornozelos
foi na verdade a sede que me tirou
da estrada. num café de província,
cadeiras de napa cor de laranja
bordavam um balcão quase vazio.
numa esquina, para poder falar
olhos nos olhos, sentava-se um casal
adolescente. na testa dele – que
era dos dois o mais bonito – bailava
sozinha uma pérola de suor, sinal
de que haveria coisas difíceis para
dizer. mas, vendo bem, os tornozelos
dela eram tão finos que não iam
aguentar aquela confissão. bebi
correndo a minha água gelada para
não atrapalhar o choro dela; e, antes
de sair, dei comigo a pensar que nem
me importaria muito de ser traída, se
pudesse ter outra vez aquela idade.","ankles
in the end it was thirst that got me
off the street. into a café, serendipitous,
orange nappa chairs
bordering an almost-empty bar.
a teenage couple crowded
in a corner so they could speak
face-to-face. the boy – the more
attractive of the two – had a drop
of sweat dancing down his brow, a sign
that a difficult discussion lay
ahead. but then again, her ankles
were so weak that surely they couldn’t
withstand any type of confession. i gulped
my ice water so as not to disturb
her crying; and, before leaving, found
myself thinking that i wouldn’t
even mind being cheated on, if
i could be that age again.",pt_XX,en_XX,"ankles
it was actually the thirst that took me
off the road. in a provincial café,
napa chairs orange in color
embroidered a nearly empty counter.
at a corner, to be able to speak
eye to eye, a teenage couple sat
his forehead – he was the prettier of the two –
a single pearl of sweat danced alone,
sign that there would be difficult things to say.
but, seeing well, her ankles
were so thin that they wouldn't
bear that confession. i drank
quickly my cold water to
not disturb her crying; and, before
leaving, i caught myself thinking that i wouldn't
mind much being cheated, if
i could be that age again."
