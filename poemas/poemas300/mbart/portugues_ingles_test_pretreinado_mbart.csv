"o sonho da linguagem
escreverás sobre a sujeição dos animais.
mas não hoje. lembra-te de como se move
a pantera, ainda, na jaula sem literatura
que lhe legaram. lembrar-te-ás. mas não hoje.
porque hoje é o dia em que as metáforas
despertam, a arca se abre, e a linguagem
se assemelha a uma invenção em aberto.
uma vigília de metáforas preenchendo a noite,
como um fogo-de-santelmo que, eternamente,
a cobrisse, a si e ao seu manto e aos seus símbolos.
hoje é o dia em que a noite se faz dia,
em que a linguagem celebra os animais
depois dos animais terem perecido,
mas sem que haja memória disso,
sequer nostalgia disso. apenas linguagem,
apenas sentido e som a ressoar dentro
do sentido, sem que a hipótese de um princípio
se imponha, sem que a hipótese de um fim se imponha.
haverás de despertar, tu também,
para a vigília das metáforas,
para o sonho da linguagem.","the dream of language

still moves in the literature-free cage
it inherited. you’ll remember. but not today.
because today’s the day when metaphors
awaken, the chest opens up, and language
resembles an invention in progress.
a vigil of metaphors filling up the night,
as if it and its mantle and its symbols
were covered by an eternal saint elmo’s fire.
today’s the day when night becomes day,
when language celebrates animals
after the animals have perished
but with no trace of them surviving
in memory or in longing. just language,
just meaning and sound echoing inside
meaning, with no possibility of a beginning
asserting itself, no possibility of an end.
you too will have to wake up
to the vigil of metaphors,
to the dream of language.",pt_XX,en_XX,"the dream of language you will write about the subjection of animals, but not today.

na hora em que eu mais ruía
o sol aplainava o relvado, palmeiras
ondulavam num lago turvo
longe o escaravelho porvindoiro
que as reduziu a um coto
assemelhando-as a um ananás que degrada hoje
pelos jardins
o repuxo animava sem triunfo o pântano
da juventude
as varandas em fogo
o verão começando pelo fim
horas extraordinárias aquelas
em que as aves adiavam o repouso por causa
dos insectos do turno sequente
ourados absortos estrepitantes
a hora em que mais ninguém deitava como eu
a bicicleta sobre a falta
e se sentava na relva prendendo as lágrimas
as mãos tapando o rosto o rosto entre os geolhos e uma
roda atrás a girar
não havia o ecrã de bolso oportuno
era inevitável encarar o que não tem conserto
nem nunca terá
era do dia o instante altíloquo
uma harmónica crepitava nos auscultadores
feria de morte o touro da tarde
esse búfalo ermo que se aparta da manada
para ficar-se
os subidos candeeiros acendiam
havia um muro recém pintado
sujo já por um grafito de província
um cão passava ao largo levantava o focinho ao
perfume dos jantares
que chegava de onde
se entrevia o espalha-cor dos televisores
havia o farrapo de lua
como flanela posta sobre a ganga das alturas
agraudava os dós arrumados
na caixa do futuro
a hédera das extensões percorria aquela hora
uma ideia sulcava a charneca celeste
o coração alpinista no avesso dos volumes
rarefeito
o mundo era já uma seara de nojo
e fartura – belo desastroso feroz – lugar de forças
e destruições
eu tacteava de olhos fechados
puro intrínseco
procurava um celeiro urbano onde guardar
o ouro-sémen pronto a detonar
a libélula extrema o grilo inicial
a andorinha cujo ninho resulta de um cúmulo
de lama e ervas secas e rasoira
as superfícies alimentando-se no ar
nas minhas costas o exíguo refrigério
da biblioteca pública
àquela hora antro de nebulosos soldados
repousando da luta de guerrilha
hasta la derrota, siempre!
infligiam estragos mínimos a um inimigo
bronco mas relutante
apenas tombavam nas emboscadas aqueles
como eu mais sorumbáticos

that moment when i was really falling apart
and the sun lingered over the lawn, and the palms
billowed above the turbid lake
faraway the promised beetle
reduced those palms to a stump
until they seemed like a pineapple which these days
rots in the gardens
the fountain blandly animated the swamp
of the young
the balconies on fire
the summer beginning at its end
overtime hours those
in which the birds delayed their naps because
of the next shift of insects
hallucinating self-absorbed clamorous
at that hour no one else like me setting their bicycle
down on the dearth
sitting on the grass holding back tears
covering their face with their hands, face between their knees and a
wheel behind still spinning
there was no convenient pocket screen
facing up to that which can’t be fixed and never will be
was inevitable
it was on that day the eloquent moment
a harmonica crackled in my headphones
mortally wounding the afternoon’s bull
that solitary buffalo that steers clear of the herd
to die
the high lamps lit up
a newly painted wall
already marked with a small town’s graffito
a dog went past lifting its snout to the
scent of dinners
which came from where
the televisions’ color-blend rose in the air
there was the shred of moon
like flannel sewn onto the denim of the heights
it nurtured hoarded hurt
in the box of the future
the ivy of extensions twined through that hour
an idea furrowed the celestial fen
the mountaineer heart inside the volumes
rarefied
the world was already a glebe of lamentation
and overabundance – beautiful disastrous fierce – locus of forces
and ruin
i fingered with my eyes closed
pure intrinsic
searched out an urban granary where i could keep
the semen-gold ready to detonate
the extreme dragonfly the first cricket
the swallow who got up its nest in a cumulus
of mud and dried weeds who smooths
the surfaces feeding itself in the air
at my back the exiguous cooling
of the public library
at that hour a cavern of nebulous soldiers
resting from their war of resistance
hasta la derrota, siempre!
they inflicted little damage on a rough
but reluctant enemy
only those as sullen as i
walked into ambushes
so many figure eights still visible on the ground
forcefully hoed up from repeatedly going round in the same place

"o corpo espacejado
perdia-se-lhe o corpo no deserto, que dentro dele aos poucos conquistava um espaço cada vez maior, novos contornos, novas posições, e lhe envolvia os órgãos que, isolados nas areias, adquiriam uma reverberação particular. ia-se de dia para dia espacejando. as várias partes de que só por abstracção se chegava à noção de um todo começavam a afastar-se umas das outras, de forma que entre elas não tardou que espumejassem as marés e a própria via-láctea principiasse a abrir caminho. a sua carne exercia aliás uma enigmática atracção sobre as estrelas, que em breve conseguiu assimilar, exibindo-as, aos olhos de quem o não soubesse, como luminosas cicatrizes cujo brilho, transmutado em sangue, lentamente se esvaía. ele mais não era, nessas ocasiões, do que um morrão, nas cinzas do qual, quase imperceptível, se podia no entanto detectar ainda a palpitação das vísceras, que a mais pequena alteração na direcção do vento era capaz de pôr de novo a funcionar. resolveu então plastificar-se. principiou pelas extremidades, pelos dedos das mãos e pelos pés, mas passado pouco tempo eram já os pulmões, os intestinos e o coração o que minuciosamente ele embrulhava em celofane, contra o qual as ondas produziam um ruído
aterrador.","the strewn body
his body was getting lost in the desert, which kept gaining more ground and redefining its borders inside him, causing his organs, isolated by the surrounding sands, to reverberate in a strange new way. day by day he was getting more strewn out. the various parts of what could only abstractly be conceived as a whole were beginning to spread apart, such that the ocean tides were soon foaming between them, and the milky way itself started cutting through. his flesh, in fact, exerted an enigmatic attraction on the stars, which in due course it managed to assimilate, exhibiting them (to the unknowing) as so many luminous scars whose glow, transformed into blood, slowly dwindled. on these occasions he was no more than an ember among the ashes, though one could still make out the faint throbbing of his guts, apt to be quickened by the slightest change in the wind’s direction. so he decided on a plastic-coated self. he began with his extremities, his fingers and feet, but soon he was meticulously wrapping his lungs, intestines and heart in cellophane, against which the waves made a frightful sound.",pt_XX,en_XX,"The spaced body lost its body in the desert, and within it, within it, it gained ever-larger space, new surroundings, new positions, and it encompassed organs that, isolated in the sand, acquired a particular reverberation. It walked day by day, spaced. The various parts of it that only by abstraction could get to the notion of the whole began to move apart from each other, so that between them the seas would soon sweep in and the railway itself would begin to make its way. Its flesh did indeed perform a mysterious attraction to the stars, and it soon managed to assimilate them, displaying to the eyes of those who did not know it, as bright scars whose brightness, transmuted into blood, slowly faded away. It was no more, in those oasis, than a moron, in whose waistlines, almost imperceptible, if you could still detect the palpitations of the veins, that the slightest change in the direction of the wind was able to get it back to work. So it decided to plaster itself. It began with the extremities, with the fingers of the hands and feet, but shortly thereafter it was the lungs, the intestines and the heart that he carefully wrapped in gelfan, against which the waves produced a terrifying noise."

"para a educação sentimental
tantas vezes se vive de uma arrebatada
noção dos contrastes mais fortes entre o bem e o
mal, entre a grandeza e a abjecção, entre as rápidas
peripécias de um heroísmo ansioso e o destino inexorável,
que o melodrama é da nossa mais funda natureza,
nostálgica, obscuramente nostálgica do coração radical,
do que vai à desfilada nos sonhos contraditórios,
do que engendra imagens capciosas e julga viver em liberdade,
mas é só imprudente e explosivo, mas esbarra
nas malhas deste mundo, nos imprevistos
da traição e da morte, ou tem de renunciar perante os rasgos
mais sublimes. a paixão dilacera bruscamente as personagens
apegadas à felicidade, os obstáculos
também têm protagonistas, ajustes de contas, cruéis fulgores,
perseguições, e nos casos desvairados de amor não há saída.
desse falhanço insuportável nasce o melodrama,
lírico, incontido, entre golfadas de espiral vertiginosa
com o sangue e a memória, com o que não tem remédio e a música trágica,
em que alguém vai morrer, alguém se perde alucinado,
e alguém se salva e porventura alguém escreve
a história e alguém lhe junta a música
para as emoções serem mais opressivas e talvez mais devoradoras
e mais fáceis, e alguém tem o desejo disso, um estremecimento
de arrepio e vulgaridade, um ávido prazer inconfessado.","sentimental education
we often live according to a rash
notion of stark contrasts between good
and evil, greatness and wretchedness, the swift deeds
of an avid heroism and the inexorable march of destiny,
melodrama being part of our deepest nature,
obscurely but stubbornly nostalgic for the radical heart,
which races at top speed in contradictory dreams,
which engenders seductive images and thinks it lives in freedom,
but it’s merely reckless and explosive, it stumbles
into the world’s snares, into unexpected
treachery and death, or it must renounce in the face of the most
sublime flashes. passion rudely lacerates people
attached to happiness. the obstacles we meet
also have protagonists, scores to settle, cruel splendors,
feverish pursuits. and in desperate cases of love there’s no way out.
from that unbearable failure is born lyrical, unbridled
melodrama, amid whirling, dizzying spurts
of blood and memory, of dashed hopes and tragic music,
in which someone dies, someone goes mad,
and someone is saved, and maybe someone writes down
the story, and someone else adds music
for the emotions to be more oppressive and perhaps more consuming
and facile, and someone desires this, it makes someone feel a shiver
of tingling banality, a voracious and unconfessed thrill.",pt_XX,en_XX,"for sentimental education so often comes from a repulsed notion of the strongest contrasts between good and evil, between grandeur and rejection, between the quick deaths of anxious heroism and the inevitable destiny, that melodrama is from our deepest nature, nostalgic, obscurely nostalgic of the radical heart, that it goes down into conflicting dreams, that it engenders vivid images and tries to live in freedom, but is only reckless and explosive, but gets lost in the evils of this world, in the unforeseens of betrayal and death, or has to give up in the face of the most sublime traits, passion abruptly dissolves the characters destined for happiness, the obstacles too have protagonists, calculation adjustments, cruel arrows, chastisement, and in cases of lost love there is no escape, and from that unbearable failure arises melodrama, lyric, unknown, between whirlwinds of vertiginous spiral with blood and memory, with which there is no medicine and tragic music, in which someone will die, someone will lose the hallucination, and someone will be saved, and perhaps someone will write the story and someone will join the music to make the emotions more oppressive and perhaps more delicious and easier, and someone has the desire for it, a stiffness of bitterness and vulgarity, an innate unconfessed pleasure."

in beauty and grace were the violas.

was sweetest, purest and most lovely?

They ask the cupid, who was there, which of those three flowers would you take, softer, purer and more beautiful?

"a viagem de alexandre à índia
andaste de um ao outro lado da terra na vida interminável,
tiveste degredos, piedosos cíumes, a fé desvanescida,
amantes paradas na lavoura, roubando-te o rosto amado.
viste vestígios de que foste a sombra de ninguém,
olhos sem pudor, do reflexo dos ferros no tropel,
franjas do domínio pueril de alexandre, olhando gaugamela.
partiste num porto de transição para o levante,
com vazios para trás, todo o tempo a poder ver,
e ao primeiro inverno, pelos cardeais das suas cinzas,
começaste a travessia que não termina, a história que não acaba.
soubeste porque se vislumbra, em lágrimas, o pinheiro da juventude,
o nome quebrado num turvo ar medido sem corda,
e a maresia do vento de feição no segundo inverno.
em troca perseguiste o que rege o homem fortuito,
segredando em palácios de mármore que são apenas pedras,
dos fracassos a que jamais alguém ajoelhara.
ao terceiro inverno descobriste o hemisfério, e ao quarto,
sem ideia de guerra ou ordem para mudar o reino,
escolheste adornar os aquedutos sob o manto dos regatos,
sentado, na brisa no tanque, ao febril entardecer.
de quem te aproximaste, no seu trajecto interminado,
sem lugar senão o que esfria na mente recortada,
naquilo que se ramifica, tornando-se na própria teia,
contigo propagou o dever de passar em toda a parte.
e quando veio o quinto inverno, e o sexto, suturaste o sangue,
trouxeste a pele à curva dos rios, acolheste o que de resto se desmorona,
e pudeste enfim, na crença dos migradores furtivos, entender que
tudo se perde noutro lugar ainda, e após esse ainda noutro
e que ao fim de cada manhã noutra manhã
tudo é incerto, tão conforme o dente-de-leão no meio de searas,
tão emudecido como a veia exausta dos não sepultados.
na mansarda onde vagueia o dia e a noite
o vento responde, cortando o centeio e o calcário, e a vela
que brilha na luz de estrelas veladas, já desaparecidas,
pisadas, mudas, engolidas aos pés do sétimo inverno,
arpoa o coração e a ruína — os meridianos despem-se, voam
em vinte e cinco anos que há pouco se beijavam, e seja dito ou não dito
o prazer que inflige um pico de tormentos
por lábios que só as mulheres conhecem
no moinho das águas da morte em varanasi,
sacode a chama de quanto vale, dura e canta
o princípio e o fim do teu poder na terra.","alexandres`s travel to india
you wandered an interminable life across the earth,
suffered exile, piteous jealousy, futile faith,
labour-arrested lovers plundering your beloved’s face.
you saw traces of having been no one’s shadow,
impudent eyes, the reflection of iron on the rampage,
hints of alexander’s puerile dominance, contemplating gaugamela.
you set off from a transient port towards the levant,
leaving emptiness behind, seeing all of time,
and in the first winter, by the cardinals of its ashes,
you started the endless crossing, the incessant history.
you knew, because the pine tree of youth can be glimpsed through tears,
of the shattered name in a cloudy mood measured without ropes,
and of the favourable sea breeze in the second winter.
in exchange you pursued that which rules the fortuitous man,
whispering in marble palaces that are but stones,
failures to which no one had ever knelt.
by the third winter you discovered the hemisphere, and by the fourth,
non intent on war or order to change the kingdom,
you chose to adorn aqueducts with the mantle of streams,
sitting by the pool breeze, in the evening´s lingering fever.
whomever you approached, in their indefinite path,
without a place except that which fades inside a patchy mind,
in that which branches out and becomes the very web,
has spread with you the duty to pass through everywhere.
and by the fifth winter, and the sixth, you stitched up the blood,
brought the skin on to the river bends, welcomed that which falls apart,
and were at last capable, with the belief of a stealthy migrant, of understanding
that all is lost yet in another place, and after this in yet another
and that by the end of each morning in another morning
all is uncertain, just like a dandelion in a field of wheat,
as muted as the exhausted vein of the unburied.
in the attic where night and day roam
the wind replies, cutting the chalk and the rye, and the candle,
shimmering in the light of the veiled stars already gone,
trodden, voiceless, swallowed up by the seventh winter,
spears the heart and the ruin — the meridians undress, fly away
in twenty five years that were just kissing yesterday, and be it told or untold
the pleasure that brings a peak of torment, inflicted
by lips that only women know
in the turmoil of varanasi´s death waters,
tests the flame of the merit, endurance and song of
the beginning and the end of your power on earth.",pt_XX,en_XX,"the journey of the arrow to India you walked from one side of the earth in an endless life, had thick, merciful eyes, vanished faith, lovers resting in the rag, robbing your beloved face. you saw evidence that you were the shadow of no one, eyes without power, the reflection of iron on the tropel, clear of the kingdom arrow of the arrow, gazing upon it. you departed in a harbor of transition to the east, with veils behind you, all the time you could see, and in the first winter, through the hearts of his thighs, you began the journey that does not end, the story that does not end. you know because if it shines, in tears, the pearl of youth, the name broken in a twisted, measuring air, and the sigh of the fierce wind in the second winter, in exchange you pursued what rules the wise man, hiding in marble palaces that are only stones, the weaknesses that no one has ever touched. in the third winter you discovered the hemisphere, and in the fourth, with no idea of war or order to change the kingdom, you chose to adorn the debris under the sailcloth, sitting, in the breeze in the tank, at the stormy twilight. whom you approached, in its endless trajectory, no place but what freezes in your cut mind, what branches, becoming your own bed, with you spread the duty to pass everywhere. and when the fifth winter came, and the sixth, you sucked the blood, brought your skin to the curve of the rivers, embraced what remains falling, and you could end up, in the belief of the wicked migrators, understanding that everything is lost in another place, and after that in another, and that at the end of every morning everything is uncertain, so as the tooth of the arrow in the middle of the evening, so familiar as the exaggerated vision of the unsealed, in the tooth of the arrow where day and night flies, the wind answers"

"a infancia da herberto helder
no princípio era a ilha
embora se diga
o espírito de deus
abraçava as águas
nesse tempo
estendia-me na terra
para olhar as estrelas
e não pensava
que esses corpos de fogo
pudessem ser perigosos
nesse tempo
marcava a latitude das estrelas
ordenando berlindes
sobre a erva
não sabia que todo o poema
é um tumulto
que pode abalar
a ordem do universo agora
acredito
eu era quase um anjo
e escrevia relatórios
precisos
acerca do silêncio
nesse tempo
ainda era possível
encontrar deus
pelos baldios
isto foi antes
de aprender a álgebra","the childhood of herberto helder
in the beginning was the island
although it’s said
that the spirit of god
hugged the waters
in those days
i’d lie down on the ground
to look at the stars
without ever thinking
that those bodies of fire
might be dangerous
in those days
i plotted the stars’ coordinates
by lining up marbles
on the grass
i didn’t know that every poem
is a tumult
that can upset
the order of the universe now
i believe
i was almost an angel
and wrote rigorous
reports
about silence
in those days
it was still possible
to find god
in the wastes
that was before
i learned algebra",pt_XX,en_XX,the childhood of the bright herb at first was the island although it's said the spirit of God embraced the waters at that time sitting on the earth to look at the stars and I didn't think these bodies of fire could be dangerous at that time marking the latitude of the stars ordering berlindes on the grass I didn't know that the whole poem is a tombstone that can shake the order of the universe now I believe I was almost an angel and I wrote accurate reports about silence at that time it was still possible to find God through buckets this was before I learned algebra
"tornozelos
foi na verdade a sede que me tirou
da estrada. num café de província,
cadeiras de napa cor de laranja
bordavam um balcão quase vazio.
numa esquina, para poder falar
olhos nos olhos, sentava-se um casal
adolescente. na testa dele – que
era dos dois o mais bonito – bailava
sozinha uma pérola de suor, sinal
de que haveria coisas difíceis para
dizer. mas, vendo bem, os tornozelos
dela eram tão finos que não iam
aguentar aquela confissão. bebi
correndo a minha água gelada para
não atrapalhar o choro dela; e, antes
de sair, dei comigo a pensar que nem
me importaria muito de ser traída, se
pudesse ter outra vez aquela idade.","ankles
in the end it was thirst that got me
off the street. into a café, serendipitous,
orange nappa chairs
bordering an almost-empty bar.
a teenage couple crowded
in a corner so they could speak
face-to-face. the boy – the more
attractive of the two – had a drop
of sweat dancing down his brow, a sign
that a difficult discussion lay
ahead. but then again, her ankles
were so weak that surely they couldn’t
withstand any type of confession. i gulped
my ice water so as not to disturb
her crying; and, before leaving, found
myself thinking that i wouldn’t
even mind being cheated on, if
i could be that age again.",pt_XX,en_XX,"spines was actually the seat that took me off the road. In a provincial coffee shop, orange-tinted kettle chairs lined an almost empty bar. In the corner, so I could speak eye-to-eye, there was a teenage couple sitting there. On his head — which was the most beautiful of the two — he was bathing himself a rose pearl, a sign that there was something difficult to say. But, you see, her spines were so thin they wouldn't support that confinement. I drank running through my frozen water so I wouldn't catch her cry, and before I left, I found myself thinking that I didn't care so much about being treated, if I could be that age again."
