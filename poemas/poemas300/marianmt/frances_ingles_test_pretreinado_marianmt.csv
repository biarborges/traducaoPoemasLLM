"je m’éveillai, c’était la maison natale,
il faisait nuit, des arbres se pressaient
de toutes parts autour de notre porte,
j’étais seul sur le seuil dans le vent froid,
mais non, nullement seul, car deux grands êtres
se parlaient au-dessus de moi, à travers moi.
l’un, derrière, une vieille femme, courbe, mauvaise,
l’autre debout dehors comme une lampe,
belle, tenant la coupe qu’on lui offrait,
buvant avidement de toute sa soif.
ai-je voulu me moquer, certes non,
plutôt ai-je poussé un cri d’amour
mais avec la bizarrerie du désespoir,
et le poison fut partout dans mes membres,
cérès moquée brisa qui l’avait aimée.
ainsi parle aujourd’hui la vie murée dans la vie.","the house where i was born (03)
i woke up, it was the house where i was born,
it was night, trees were crowding
on all sides around our door,
i was alone on the doorstep in the cold wind,
no, not alone, for two huge beings
were speaking to each other above me, through me.
one, behind, an old woman, stooped, mean,
the other standing upright outside like a lamp,
beautiful, holding the cup that had been offered her,
drinking greedily to calm her thirst.
did i think to mock her, surely not,
rather i let out a cry of love
but with the strangeness of despair,
and the poison ran throughout my body,
ceres, mocked, broke the one who loved her.
thus speaks the life walled up in life today.","You know, when you're busy, you'll have to go to bed.
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, like, you know, you know, you know, you know, like, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, like, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, like, you know, you know, you know, you know, like, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, like, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know...

"ô sidi-yahya sage de tous les sages
prête-moi une belle houria ivre de passion et une flûte
magique.
car demain, je partirai vers l'inconnu qui n'attendrai.
cette terre échappante de toutes les saisons amères.
je bénis la mer en feu.
cette mer massacrée et décapitée par les vagues enragées.
avec leurs chants tristes
elles revivent mon temps enivré écho par écho.
orphelin depuis l'âge de trois hivers rigoureux.
je suis né pour goûter la galette de la souffrance monotone.
on m'a apprit à rêver.
mais mes nuits étaient éphémères
oû les étoiles prémonitoires se broyaient.
ma voix humide, étouffante quelque fois écorche le vide
frange
qui de temps en temps suscite les incantations évasives
je suis baptisé par les écumes de nuages méditerranéens
et les ombres de saisons vièrges.
on m'a apprit à écrire les mots et les rythmes.
on m'a apprit que la gloire humaine est une voix apprivoisée
par le desir de la prouesse succulente et vénéneuse.
ma voix cette saliva rupture qui grouille dans la nuit comme
un gouffre de sang, comme une fournaise brûlante sans cesse
dans les brasiers du destin et de la passion.
je suis né dans un labyrinthe où les larmes et les sueurs se
trébuchaient en deluge transfilant
on m'a dit que ma voix ressemble à une source inondée par
l'apocalypse assoiffé.
certes, je suis né pour libérer ma voix, ma vocation et mon
émoi.
des vieux sages du village n'gadi pulvérisent des paroles
pétillantes pour chasser l'ennui et le cauchemar perdurant.
j'ai quitté mon village sans mener avec moi leurs
bénédictions.
j'ai laissé avec eux ma toison aux mille trous.
mon seul compagnon un talisman gravé par les mendiants du
souk-al-joutiya.
je suis devenu dépaysé comme une alouette éclopée.
j'ai parcouru les chemins de l'enfer et de l'avatar.
une image superstitieuse m'envahis, m'écrase.
adieu solitude écrasante et sans espoir.
bonjour la folie des rêves pamoisons.
dans mon ivresse
j'ai rencontré le bonheur en lambeaux.
soleil-vengeur
j'accuse tes rayons écorchants.
soleil-dieu exhalte mon endurance âpre.","a migrant's notebook (part 3)
o sidi-yahya , sage of all sages,
lend me a beautiful houria, and a magic flute,
wild with passion,
for tomorrow, i shall leave for the unknown
where no one await me,
to the land where all bitter seasons vanish.
i bless the sea of flame.
this sea of carnage massacred and decapitated by the ranging
waves,
with their woeful chanting rites,
revived my memory of that intoxicating time
echo by echo
orphaned since the age of three severe winters,
i was born to taste the humble pie of monotonous sufferance.
one taught me to dream,
but my nights were too ephemeral
where foretelling stars clash with each other.
my moist voice , choking from time to time,
grazes the empty fringe (of my throat)
which irritates me to let go my sotto voce (suppressed)curses.
i am baptised by the foams of mediterannean snow
and the shadows of virgin seasons.
i was taught to write the words and rhythm,
i was taught that the human pride is a voice
tamed by the desire of succulent and poisonous feat.
my voice with ruptured flow of fluid
which became agitated in the night
as a gush of blood,
as a relentlessly burning furnace
in the bright fires of destiny and of passion.
i was born in a labyrinth where tears and sweat clash into each
other
in a criss-crossing deluge.
i was told that my voice was like a source
inundated by the thirsty apocalypse.
i was born , for certain, to liberate my voice,
my longings, and my emotion.
the elders of the village n’gadi
gave me enlightening advice
to rid of the boredom and the lingering nightmare.
i left my village without their blessings.
i left them my sac of bric-a-brac full of holes.
my only companion was a talisman with the engravings
of the beggars of souk-al joutia .
i became disoriented like a lame lark.
i pursued all roads to hell and to avatar.
a foreboding invaded me , crushing my heart
so long, the oppressive loneliness and hopelessness
good morning, the folly of dizzy dreams.","God-desy for the needy, the needy, the needy, the needy, the needy, the needy, the needy, the needy, the needy, the needy, the needy, the needy, the needy, the needy, the needy, the needy.

when someone ignores your right of way,
when someone scratches your car,
when you spill your coffee, when you forget, when you miss,
when meetings run, when deadlines fall, when you forget to take home
bread and children

when those absent leave our memories,
cleaned from pictures, deleted by distances, weather and worries
when their faces become blurry,
vague, pale or imprecise

fears, hunger, hatred, despair, fury, horror, sorrow and tortures
poetry is useful
when the alarm clock rings, whistling, jovial
and you know you are alive, present, standing-up
in your living space full of people, sounds and memories

all that follows is from profane memory
the poets reinvented everything
they needed a man
to upstage the gods
and, like any man
far from home
with much weeping
to curse the wine-dark sea
and tear at his face
when the poet died
ten took his place and rewrote the story
and so man created the myth
i nailed hope to the four walls of my cell
there is no land more vast than memory
i hollowed out its mountains, drained its rivers
searched among the stones of all its ramparts
waiting for my errant lover to return

endures your deliriums

certainly one last breath signaled that she had made up her mind, while the room had no other exit
seeing her, i said to myself: her eye is golden and her mouth is a secret
we dressed her in a gown that suited her well
we did her hair, which i had cut
then the child left his cage and excused himself for forgetting something
i walk no doubt in what he forgot
i hear her voice when i look at her, by chance, on the side she’s on

tu rentres. tu quittes le rivage. tu retournes en terre. les amers quittent la mer.
soudain cette moitié du monde qui était en mer redevient terre – forêts, champs, campagne. a
son tour celle-ci devient l’océan. tu reviens au monde des vivants comme un grec débarqué
tournait le dos à l’inféconde. l’immensité se fait solide, moissonneuse, verte et blonde,
guéable. les nuages sont utile. tu écartes les buissons de la lisière, rentres dans le bois,
retournes à l’épais – l’impénétrable. la forêt de chênes chante.

l’oisiveté léopardienne; c’est quand les champs et les eaux, les forêts et les fleurs, les nuages
et les neiges assonent dans le zèle des saisons.

the infertile. immensity becomes solid, harvester, green and gold, fordable. the clouds are
useful. you push the bushes away from the edge, enter the wood, return to thickness – the
inpenetrable. the oak wood sings.

assonate in the zeal of seasons.
with this: repulsed, sensed, ulcerating, the funereal counter-current, the plot of destiny,

je viens de recevoir ta dernière lettre et j’y réponds immédiatement. tu me demandes si j’ai bien reçu ta dernière lettre et si j’ai l’intention d’y répondre. je me permets de te faire remarquer que l’envoi de ta dernière lettre fait que la lettre que tu m’as envoyée précédemment n’est plus désormais ta dernière lettre et que si je réponds comme je suis en train de le faire à ta dernière lettre, je ne réponds pas à celle qui est maintenant ton avant-dernière lettre. je ne peux donc satisfaire à la demande que tu me fais dans ta dernière lettre. j’observerai par ailleurs que ta dernière lettre ne répond pas, contrairement à ce que tu affirmes (je te cite: « j’ai bien reçu ta dernière lettre et j’y réponds immédiatement ») à la lettre où je te demandais, si je m’abuse (mais je ne m’abuse pas, j’ai les doubles) si tu avais bien reçu ma dernière lettre et si tu avais l’intention d’y répondre. en l’absence d’éclaircissements et de réponses de ta part sur ces deux points auxquels j’attache (à bon droit je pense) une certaine importance, je me verrai, à mon regret, obligé d’interrompre notre correspondance.
lettre 2
je n’ai pas encore reçu ta prochaine lettre mais j’y réponds immédiatement. tu m’y demandes si j’ai bien reçu ta dernière lettre et si j’ai l’intention d’y répondre. tu te demanderas peut-être comment, n’ayant pas encore reçu ta prochaine lettre, je peux savoir que tu m’y demandes si j’ai bien reçu ta dernière lettre et si j’ai l’intention d’y répondre. la réponse est simple: toutes tes lettres, et celle-ci sera la trois-cent-dix-septième (je les ai toutes, ainsi que les doubles de toutes mes lettres) commencent par: « as-tu reçu ma dernière lettre? si oui (et je serais fort étonné que tu ne l’aie pas reçue encore (si c’était le cas, fais-le moi savoir)), as-tu l’intention d’y répondre? ». c’est ainsi que commençait la première lettre que j’ai reçue de toi. c’est ainsi que commençait la deuxième, la troisième, et ainsi de suite jusqu’à ta dernière lettre, la trois-cent-seizième. raisonnant donc par induction, j’en déduis que ta prochaine lettre commencera comme les précédentes. je me considère en conséquence autorisé à y répondre comme si je l’avais dès maintenant reçue. et je te réponds comme suit: je viens de recevoir ta dernière lettre et j’y réponds immédiatement. tu me demandes si j’ai bien reçu ta dernière lettre et si j’ai l’intention d’y répondre. je me permets de te faire remarquer que l’envoi de ta dernière lettre fait que la lettre que tu m’as envoyée précédemment n’est plus désormais ta dernière lettre et que si je réponds comme je suis en train de le faire à ta dernière lettre, je ne réponds pas à celle qui est maintenant ton avant-dernière lettre. je ne peux donc satisfaire à la demande que tu me fais dans ta dernière lettre. j’observerai par ailleurs que ta dernière lettre ne répond pas, contrairement à ce que tu affirmes (je te cite: « j’ai bien reçu ta dernière lettre et j’y réponds immédiatement «) à la lettre où je te demandais, si je ne m’abuse (mais je ne m’abuse pas, j’ai les doubles) si tu avais bien reçu ma dernière lettre et si tu avais l’intention d’y répondre. en l’absence d’éclaircissements et de réponses de ta part sur ces deux points auxquels j’attache (à bon droit je pense) une certaine importance, je me verrai, à mon regret, obligé d’interrompre notre correspondance.
lettre 3
je viens de lire ta première lettre (elle date du 23 novembre 1960). tu m’as donc écrit, en moyenne, depuis cette date, une lettre toutes les six semaines deux tiers (il n’y a jamais eu d’intervalle de moins de six semaines et de plus de sept entre deux de tes lettres) et quelque chose m’a frappé. tu m’écrivais (je te le rappelle, au cas où tu l’aurais oublié): « as-tu reçu ma dernière lettre? si oui (et je serais fort étonné que tu ne l’aie pas reçue encore (si c’était le cas, fais-le moi savoir)), as-tu l’intention d’y répondre? ». or, je n’ai aucune trace, dans mes archives, où je conserve de manière systématique et absolue, toutes les lettres que je reçois, et des doubles de toutes celles que j’envoie, je n’ai aucune trace, dis-je, d’une lettre de toi antérieure à celle du 23 novembre 1960, dont je viens de te rappeler la première phrase. ni, d’ailleurs, ce qui est au moins aussi troublant, de cette lettre de moi à laquelle tu fais allusion au milieu de ta lettre du 23 novembre 1960 qui, dans mes archives, porte, de ma main, inscrit en haut à gauche du quart de feuille 21x27, format dont tu ne t’es jamais départi pendant toutes ces années, au crayon, le n°1. pourtant, je me souviens on ne peut plus clairement de l’arrivée de ta lettre du 23 novembre 1960 (je venais de rentrer chez moi après une réunion de travail avec des amis). l’écriture m’était inconnue, ainsi que la signature, q.b., (je ne connais toujours pas, après quarante ans, autre chose de ton nom que tes initiales). je t’ai répondu immédiatement, et notre correspondance, quarante ans plus tard, dure encore. comme tu me dis, dans cette même lettre, celle du 23 novembre 1960, que tu conserves dans tes archives des doubles de toutes les lettres que tu envoies comme de toutes celles que tu reçois (information que tu ne manques pas de répéter (je le remarque en relisant notre correspondance) dans toutes, je dis bien toutes tes lettres) tu as certainement conservé le double de celle dont tu parles au commencement de la lettre du 23 novembre 1960. tu pourras donc éclaircir aisément ce petit mystère.

letter 1
i’ve just received your last letter and am immediately replying. you’ve asked if i’ve received your last letter and if i intend to reply. if i may, please let me point out that your having sent your last letter makes the letter you previously sent no longer the most recent, and if i reply, as i am now doing, it is not in response to your second-to-last letter. i cannot, therefore, satisfy the requests you’ve made in your last letter. i would also observe, by the way, that your last letter does not respond, despite what you affirm (and i quote: “i’ve just received your last letter and am immediately replying”), to the letter in which i queried, lest i am mistaken (but i am not mistaken, i’ve got copies), if you had received my last letter and if you intended to reply. failing any clarification and response from you on these two points, to which i attach (for good reason, i think) particular importance, i shall, much to my regret, be obliged to interrupt our correspondence.
letter 2
i have yet to receive your next letter but shall immediately reply. you ask if i’ve received your last letter and if i intend to reply. you might well wonder how, not yet having received your next letter, i can know that you’ve asked me if i’ve received your last letter and if i intend to reply. the answer is simple: all of your letters, and this one will be your three hundred and seventeenth (i have them all, as well as copies of all of mine) begin thus: “have you received my last letter? if so (and i would be quite surprised if you had not yet (though, should that be the case, do let me know)), do you intend to reply?” that’s how you began your very first letter to me. that’s how you began your second letter, your third letter, and so on, until your last letter, the three hundred and sixteenth. reasoning by induction, i’ve deduced that your next letter will begin like the preceding ones. consequently, i consider myself authorized to reply to it as if i had already received it. and i reply with the following: i’ve just received your last letter and am immediately replying. you’ve asked if i’ve received your last letter and if i intend to reply. if i may, please let me point out that your having sent your last letter makes the letter you previously sent no longer the most recent and if i reply, as i am now doing, it is not in response to your second to last letter. i cannot, therefore, satisfy the requests you’ve made in your last letter. i would also observe, by the way, that your last letter does not respond, despite what you affirm (and i quote: “i’ve just received your last letter and am immediately replying”), to the letter in which i queried, lest i am mistaken (but i am not mistaken, i’ve got copies), if you had received my last letter and if you intended to reply. failing any clarification and response from you on these two points, to which i attach (for good reason, i think) particular importance, i shall, much to my regret, be obliged to interrupt our correspondence.
letter 3
i’ve just read your first letter (dated 23 november, 1960. you have therefore written, on average, since that date, one letter every six and two thirds weeks (there never was an interval shorter than six weeks or longer than seven weeks between two of your letters)) and something has struck me. you had written (i remind you, in case you have forgotten): “have you received my last letter? if so (and i would be quite surprised if you had not yet (though, should that be the case, do let me know)), do you intend to reply?” besides, i have no trace, in my archives, where i conserve, in a systematic and absolute fashion, all the letters i receive, and the doubles of those i send—i have no trace, i was saying, of any letter from you prior to the one dated 23 november, 1960, the one whose first sentence i’ve just called to your attention. nor, for that matter, which is at least as troubling, of that letter from me to you to which you allude in the middle of your letter to me of 23 november, 1960, which bears, in the upper left quarter of the 21x27cm sheet, the format from which you have not deviated in all of these years, in your handwriting, scrawled in pencil, the number 1. nonetheless, i remember—as one could not more clearly remember—the arrival of your letter of 23 november, 1960. (i had just come home from a working meeting with friends.) the handwriting was strange to me, as was the signature: q. b. (after forty years, i still know nothing more of your name but its initials.) i immediately replied and our correspondence carries on, forty years later. since you inform me in that very same letter, the one dated 23 november, 1960, that you conserve in your archives the doubles of all the letters you send and the ones you receive (information you don’t neglect to repeat (i realize now as i look over our correspondence) in all, i did say all of your letters) you have certainly kept a double of the one you mention at the beginning of the letter dated 23 november, 1960. you could therefore easily clarify this little mystery.
letter 4
i haven’t received a thing from you in weeks. what is happening?
letter 5 (fragments)
i have just received your last letter (finally) and am immediately
replying. you ask if i’ve received your last letter and if i intend to reply.

"j’eus dix ans le ciel en tête
j’empruntai ses ailes au soleil
pour voler vers ce lieu entre deux rives
j’élevai des tours de sable
qu’habitait l’ombre qui me servait de corps
corps mûri par un soleil d’extrême été
j’étais dans la pensée du vent
les tons de la lumière
composaient mon paysage
j’étais dans la couleur du jour
je grimaçais avec les pierres
où s’abritaient les scorpions
dans l’île les femmes portaient un masque
peut-être par pudeur
le ciel en tête je me faisais invisible
pour mieux voir frappais aux vitres
où se rassemblait le jour
en un hymne quotidien
je cherchais un sens à la forme –
au-delà le monde devait exister
j’eus vingt ans impatiente
d’aborder des continents neufs
je quittai la maison de mon père
livrai à la lumière ma liberté d’oiseau
entrai dans l’espace de l’obscur
je cherchai à ouvrir des portes invisibles
affirmai lire la matière même du silence
comme une langue natale
fis du passé un commencement
et du présent une double absence
corps vivant plus que mort
je refusais que la nuit me sépare
du jour et le jour de la nuit
veilleur du rêve que le rêve invente
que cherchais-je lorsque j’ouvrais les yeux
sur les couleurs du monde
que jamais ne perd de vue le soleil
de la mémoire seconde des mots
naît l’émotion la plus réelle
j’habite cette musique
que je ne puis être seule à entendre
ombre qui suit ou précède son ombre
aux frontières entre rêve et réel
je demeure en marge de moi-même
dans l’espace et dans le temps
comment savoir si en ce lieu
de nulle part où se libère la voix
je suis venue de moi-même
ou s’il s’est imposé","i was ten years old head full of sky
i was ten years old head full of sky
i borrowed the sun’s wings
to fly toward that spot between two shores
i built towers of sand
where that shadow lived which served as my body
body ripened by a sun of extreme summer
i was in the wind’s thoughts
intonations of light
composed my landscape
in the color of day
i scowled with the stones
where scorpions sheltered
on the island, women went masked
perhaps out of modesty
sky in my head i would make myself invisible
to see better, knocked at windowpanes
where the day gathered
in an ordinary hymn
i looked for meaning in form –
somewhere out there the world must exist
i was twenty years old impatient
to shore up at new continents
i left my father’s house
gave my avian liberty up to the light
entered the space of darkness
i tried to open invisible doors
claimed to read the very stuff of silence
like a mother tongue
made a beginning of the past
and a double absence of the present
body more alive than dead
i refused to let night separate me
from day or day from night
watcher of dreams whom a dream invented
what was i looking for when i opened my eyes
on the colors of the world
which the sun never lets out of its sight
from words’ second memory
real feeling is born
i inhabit that music
which i can’t be the only one to hear
shadow which follows or precedes its shadow
on the border between dream and real
i stay on my own margins
in space and time
how to know if in this nowhere
place where a voice sets itself free
i came of my own free will
or if it was imposed on me","But I'd like to say that I don't want to be

il pleuvait doucement dans toutes les salles,
j’allais d’une à une autre, regardant
l’eau qui étincelait sur les miroirs
amoncelés partout, certains brisés ou même
poussés entre des meubles et les murs.
c’était de ces reflets que, parfois, un visage
se dégageait, riant, d’une douceur
de plus et autrement que ce qu’est le monde.
et je touchais, hésitant, dans l’image
les mèches désordonnées de la déesse,
je découvrais sous le voile de l’eau
son front triste et distrait de petite fille.
étonnement entre être et ne pas être,
main qui hésite à toucher la buée,

i woke up, it was the house where i was born.
it was raining softly in all the rooms,
i went from one to another, looking at
the water that shone on the mirrors
piled up everywhere, some broken or even
pushed between the furniture and the walls.
it was from these reflections that sometimes a face
would emerge, laughing, of a gentleness
that was different from what the world is.
and, with a hesitant hand, i touched in the image
the tossled hair of the goddess,
beneath the veil of the water
i could see the sad, distracted face of a little girl.
bewilderment between being and not being,
hand that is reluctant to touch the mist,
then i listened as the laughter faded away
in the halls of the empty house.
here nothing but forever the gift of the dream,
the outstretched hand that does not cross
the fast flowing water where memories vanish.","You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,

"féerie
sept femmes nues
avec pour toute parure
un torque autour du cou
avancent vers moi dans la forêt
elles sont belles à se damner
les cheveux blonds ou roux
comme des traînes en allées
dans le vent qui se replie
elles chantent des couplets perdus
et ravivent les anciens dieux vaincus
celle-ci au visage couvert d’éphélides
se tient debout face à moi elle dit
“je t’ai reconnu. ton nom est colère “
elle entoure mon sexe de sa main
ses yeux verts arrimés aux miens
pendant que tous les corps s’enlacent
et que sourdent les murmures
je demeure immobile incapable de choisir
entre ma civilisation et celle oubliée
mais quelqu’un entaille mon poignet
lape le sang qui s’égoutte
avant de le répandre avec la langue
dans chaque orifice de mon corps
elle qui m’a parlé recueille ma semence
et la répand sur mon torse
avant de rejoindre le groupe lascif
me laissant stupide sous les feuillages
surveillé par l’œil à demi assoupi du hibou
semblable à l’œil de la guerre
des rires s’éloignent dans la pénombre
je devine encore une voix moqueuse
aube rauque et cristalline
écorchée sur la peau du monde
ce très long serpent vorace
la voix confuse me parvient par bribes
portées par le vent qui réunit :
“colère, tu continueras à rôder sur les chemins
jusqu’au jour où tu trouveras ton véritable nom”
mais déjà toute magie s’est égarée
au plus profond de la plus sombre des forêts.","fairyland
seven naked women
all wearing for finery
a torque around the neck
advancing towards me in a forest
they are wickedly beautiful
redheads or blondes
like the leafy borders avenues
in the wind which enfolds them
they sing lost couplets
and revive ancient vanquished gods
this one with a freckled face
stands before me and says
‘i recognize you. your name is anger’
she takes my sex in her hand
her green eyes moored to mine
whilst both bodies entwine
and murmurs softly depart
i remain still unable to choose
between my civilization and one forgotten
but someone cuts my wrist
laps the blood that runs
before spreading it with the tongue
into every orifice of my body
she who spoke to me gathers my seed
and smears it over my torso
before rejoining the lustful group
leaving me foolish beneath the leafage
surveyed by the half asleep eye of an owl
resembling the eye of war
laughter grows distant in the half-light
i can still discern a mocking voice
dawn husky and crystalline
flayed on the skin of the world
this long voracious serpent
the confused voice reaches me in fragments
carried on the wind which reunites
‘anger, you will continue to wander the paths
until the day you find your true name’
but already all magic was lost
to the deepest depths of the darkest forests","Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real Real

i am lying in the hollow of a boat,
my forehead and eyes against the curved planks
where i can hear the undercurrents
striking the bottom of the boat.
all at once, the prow rises up,
and i think that we’ve come to the estuary,
but i keep my eyes against the wood
that smells of tar and glue.
too vast, too luminous the images
that i have gathered in my sleep.
why rediscover, outside,
the things that words tell me of,
but without convincing me,
i desire a higher or less somber shore.
and yet i give up this ground that stirs
beneath the body waking to itself, i get up,
i go from room to room in the house,
they are endless now,
i can hear the cries of voices behind doors,
i am seized by these sorrows that knock
against the ruined casings, i hurry on,
the lingering night is too heavy for me,
frightened, i go into a room cluttered with desks,
look, i’m told, this was your classroom,
see on the walls the first images you looked at,
look, the tree, look, there, the yelping dog,
and the geography map on the yellow wall,
this fading of names and forms,
this effacing of mountains and rivers
by the whiteness that freezes language.
look, this was your only book. the isis of the plaster
on the wall of this room, which is pealing away,
never had, nor ever will have anything other
