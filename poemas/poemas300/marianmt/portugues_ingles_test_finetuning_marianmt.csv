"o sonho da linguagem
escreverás sobre a sujeição dos animais.
mas não hoje. lembra-te de como se move
a pantera, ainda, na jaula sem literatura

despertam, a arca se abre, e a linguagem
se assemelha a uma invenção em aberto.
uma vigília de metáforas preenchendo a noite,
como um fogo-de-santelmo que, eternamente,
a cobrisse, a si e ao seu manto e aos seus símbolos.
hoje é o dia em que a noite se faz dia,
em que a linguagem celebra os animais
depois dos animais terem perecido,
mas sem que haja memória disso,
sequer nostalgia disso. apenas linguagem,
apenas sentido e som a ressoar dentro

se imponha, sem que a hipótese de um fim se imponha.

na hora em que eu mais ruía
o sol aplainava o relvado, palmeiras
ondulavam num lago turvo
longe o escaravelho porvindoiro
que as reduziu a um coto
assemelhando-as a um ananás que degrada hoje
pelos jardins
o repuxo animava sem triunfo o pântano
da juventude
as varandas em fogo
o verão começando pelo fim
horas extraordinárias aquelas
em que as aves adiavam o repouso por causa
dos insectos do turno sequente
ourados absortos estrepitantes
a hora em que mais ninguém deitava como eu
a bicicleta sobre a falta
e se sentava na relva prendendo as lágrimas
as mãos tapando o rosto o rosto entre os geolhos e uma
roda atrás a girar
não havia o ecrã de bolso oportuno
era inevitável encarar o que não tem conserto
nem nunca terá
era do dia o instante altíloquo
uma harmónica crepitava nos auscultadores
feria de morte o touro da tarde
esse búfalo ermo que se aparta da manada
para ficar-se
os subidos candeeiros acendiam
havia um muro recém pintado
sujo já por um grafito de província
um cão passava ao largo levantava o focinho ao
perfume dos jantares
que chegava de onde
se entrevia o espalha-cor dos televisores
havia o farrapo de lua
como flanela posta sobre a ganga das alturas
agraudava os dós arrumados
na caixa do futuro
a hédera das extensões percorria aquela hora
uma ideia sulcava a charneca celeste
o coração alpinista no avesso dos volumes
rarefeito
o mundo era já uma seara de nojo
e fartura – belo desastroso feroz – lugar de forças
e destruições
eu tacteava de olhos fechados
puro intrínseco
procurava um celeiro urbano onde guardar
o ouro-sémen pronto a detonar
a libélula extrema o grilo inicial
a andorinha cujo ninho resulta de um cúmulo
de lama e ervas secas e rasoira
as superfícies alimentando-se no ar
nas minhas costas o exíguo refrigério
da biblioteca pública
àquela hora antro de nebulosos soldados
repousando da luta de guerrilha
hasta la derrota, siempre!
infligiam estragos mínimos a um inimigo
bronco mas relutante
apenas tombavam nas emboscadas aqueles
como eu mais sorumbáticos

that moment when i was really falling apart
and the sun lingered over the lawn, and the palms
billowed above the turbid lake
faraway the promised beetle
reduced those palms to a stump
until they seemed like a pineapple which these days
rots in the gardens
the fountain blandly animated the swamp
of the young
the balconies on fire
the summer beginning at its end
overtime hours those
in which the birds delayed their naps because
of the next shift of insects
hallucinating self-absorbed clamorous
at that hour no one else like me setting their bicycle
down on the dearth
sitting on the grass holding back tears
covering their face with their hands, face between their knees and a
wheel behind still spinning
there was no convenient pocket screen
facing up to that which can’t be fixed and never will be
was inevitable
it was on that day the eloquent moment
a harmonica crackled in my headphones
mortally wounding the afternoon’s bull
that solitary buffalo that steers clear of the herd
to die
the high lamps lit up
a newly painted wall
already marked with a small town’s graffito
a dog went past lifting its snout to the
scent of dinners
which came from where
the televisions’ color-blend rose in the air
there was the shred of moon
like flannel sewn onto the denim of the heights
it nurtured hoarded hurt
in the box of the future
the ivy of extensions twined through that hour
an idea furrowed the celestial fen
the mountaineer heart inside the volumes
rarefied

and overabundance – beautiful disastrous fierce – locus of forces
and ruin

pure intrinsic
searched out an urban granary where i could keep
the semen-gold ready to detonate
the extreme dragonfly the first cricket
the swallow who got up its nest in a cumulus
of mud and dried weeds who smooths
the surfaces feeding itself in the air
at my back the exiguous cooling
of the public library
at that hour a cavern of nebulous soldiers
resting from their war of resistance
hasta la derrota, siempre!
they inflicted little damage on a rough
but reluctant enemy

of an avid heroism and the inexorable march of destiny,
melodrama being part of our deepest nature,
obscurely but stubbornly nostalgic for the radical heart,
which races at top speed in contradictory dreams,
which engenders seductive images and thinks it lives in freedom,
but it’s merely reckless and explosive, it stumbles
into the world’s snares, into unexpected
treachery and death, or it must renounce in the face of the most
sublime flashes. passion rudely lacerates people
attached to happiness. the obstacles we meet
also have protagonists, scores to settle, cruel splendors,
feverish pursuits. and in desperate cases of love there’s no way out.
from that unbearable failure is born lyrical, unbridled
melodrama, amid whirling, dizzying spurts
of blood and memory, of dashed hopes and tragic music,
in which someone dies, someone goes mad,
and someone is saved, and maybe someone writes down
the story, and someone else adds music
for the emotions to be more oppressive and perhaps more consuming
and facile, and someone desires this, it makes someone feel a shiver

tiveste degredos, piedosos cíumes, a fé desvanescida,
amantes paradas na lavoura, roubando-te o rosto amado.
viste vestígios de que foste a sombra de ninguém,
olhos sem pudor, do reflexo dos ferros no tropel,
franjas do domínio pueril de alexandre, olhando gaugamela.
partiste num porto de transição para o levante,
com vazios para trás, todo o tempo a poder ver,
e ao primeiro inverno, pelos cardeais das suas cinzas,
começaste a travessia que não termina, a história que não acaba.
soubeste porque se vislumbra, em lágrimas, o pinheiro da juventude,
o nome quebrado num turvo ar medido sem corda,
e a maresia do vento de feição no segundo inverno.
em troca perseguiste o que rege o homem fortuito,
segredando em palácios de mármore que são apenas pedras,
dos fracassos a que jamais alguém ajoelhara.
ao terceiro inverno descobriste o hemisfério, e ao quarto,
sem ideia de guerra ou ordem para mudar o reino,
escolheste adornar os aquedutos sob o manto dos regatos,
sentado, na brisa no tanque, ao febril entardecer.
de quem te aproximaste, no seu trajecto interminado,
sem lugar senão o que esfria na mente recortada,
naquilo que se ramifica, tornando-se na própria teia,
contigo propagou o dever de passar em toda a parte.
e quando veio o quinto inverno, e o sexto, suturaste o sangue,
trouxeste a pele à curva dos rios, acolheste o que de resto se desmorona,
e pudeste enfim, na crença dos migradores furtivos, entender que
tudo se perde noutro lugar ainda, e após esse ainda noutro
e que ao fim de cada manhã noutra manhã
tudo é incerto, tão conforme o dente-de-leão no meio de searas,
tão emudecido como a veia exausta dos não sepultados.

you wandered an interminable life across the earth,
suffered exile, piteous jealousy, futile faith,
labour-arrested lovers plundering your beloved’s face.
you saw traces of having been no one’s shadow,
impudent eyes, the reflection of iron on the rampage,
hints of alexander’s puerile dominance, contemplating gaugamela.
you set off from a transient port towards the levant,
leaving emptiness behind, seeing all of time,
and in the first winter, by the cardinals of its ashes,
you started the endless crossing, the incessant history.
you knew, because the pine tree of youth can be glimpsed through tears,
of the shattered name in a cloudy mood measured without ropes,
and of the favourable sea breeze in the second winter.
in exchange you pursued that which rules the fortuitous man,
whispering in marble palaces that are but stones,
failures to which no one had ever knelt.
by the third winter you discovered the hemisphere, and by the fourth,
non intent on war or order to change the kingdom,
you chose to adorn aqueducts with the mantle of streams,
sitting by the pool breeze, in the evening´s lingering fever.
whomever you approached, in their indefinite path,
without a place except that which fades inside a patchy mind,
in that which branches out and becomes the very web,
has spread with you the duty to pass through everywhere.
and by the fifth winter, and the sixth, you stitched up the blood,
brought the skin on to the river bends, welcomed that which falls apart,
and were at last capable, with the belief of a stealthy migrant, of understanding
that all is lost yet in another place, and after this in yet another

all is uncertain, just like a dandelion in a field of wheat,
as muted as the exhausted vein of the unburied.

shimmering in the light of the veiled stars already gone,

in twenty five years that were just kissing yesterday, and be it told or untold
