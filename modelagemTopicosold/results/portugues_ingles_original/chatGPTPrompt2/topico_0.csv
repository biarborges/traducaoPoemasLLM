There are no places, never were, not even ancient.
There's what we see in them, their dust-brick mark that makes them disappear.
Only thus can we arrive. Only softly, to remember.
Not to touch the lilac columns or make the crossing on the tangerine sailboat.

"nada existe que não tivesse começado.
mesmo na lonjura, decisiva porção iluminada,
em territórios despojados de todo o fim, em
areais de mares a desaguar desconhecidamente,
mais não olhamos senão a extensão do que vimos.
se campos da livónia vão dar a campos da mazúria,
se mosaicos amaciam na água de banhos mornos,
e além houver só cemitérios seguindo cemitérios, e
a meio deles, parado sem vento, o bosque de bétulas,
se o sol é o lume do azeite a esmiolar o pão
ou o clarão lascado nas muralhas de helsingør,
se o enredo da morte é igual em toda a parte,
seja na flauta de santa maria ou no gaiteiro de tallinn,
é porque modulamos num lugar o que lastrou de outro.
mesmo sem querer, ou sejam sombras afastando-se,
mais não tecemos que a linha de acasos e acertos
que uma corrente conduz, a cada um, em separado,
à passagem mais sensível do acabamento.
mesmo isolando os lugares numa função laboriosa,
detalhando as suas divergências, e as pontas extremas
— a parecença entre o que são e o que pensámos serem,
mesmo nas regiões cruzadas por comboios extensos,
onde a noite cairá em escamas de lavanda,
seguiremos a mesma história — afundamos os pés no mesmo solo.
naquilo por que vamos repetidamente levados,
ansiando o que se manifeste acolá na próxima enseada,
alisando com a mão os castanheiros onde inscrevemos, depois
de outros, nossos sinuosos nomes, nossos amores,
sempre tornamos ao ponto em que tudo se repete e inicia,
de que atingimos apenas um minuto só — um instante,
a lâmina que medeia o ano que passa e o ano que vem.","nothing exists that hasn’t had a beginning.
nothing exists that hasn’t had a beginning.
even in the distance, a clear lit speck,
in territories stripped from all limits, on
sands that flow from unknown seas,
we only contemplate the extent of what we perceived.
if fields in livonia lead to fields in masuria,
if tiles are smoothed in tepid bath waters,
and further on graveyard follows graveyard, and
in their midst, inert in the lack of wind, the birch wood stands,
if the sun is the flame of the olive oil crumbling the bread
or the chipped lightening on the walls of helsingør,
if the death plot is everywhere the same,
be it in the santa maria flute or in the tallinn concertina
it is because we modulate in one place what has seeped from another.
even unwillingly, or perhaps it’s the shadows on the move,
we weave no more than a row of chances and discretions
along a current which takes each one of us, separately,
to the most sensitive final passage.
even if laboriously we detach the places,
detailing their diversions and extremes
— the similarity between what they are and what we thought they were,
even throughout regions intersected by extensive trains,
where night will fall in scales of lavender,
we’ll follow the same story — we sink our feet in the same mud.
in that which repeatedly sucks us in,
as we yearn for whatever comes to pass further in the next cove
smoothing with our hands the oak trees on whose bark we inscribe,
like others before us, our sinuous names, our loves,
we constantly return to the point where all is repeated and begun,
of which we grasp a mere minute — an instant,
the blade mediating between this year and the next.",pt_XX,en_XX,"Nothing exists that hadn't once begun its tale,
even in the distance, a decisive portion aflame,
in territories stripped of any end, in
sands of seas flowing into the unknown,
we behold only the extension of what we've seen.
whether Livonian fields transition to Mazurian plains,
or mosaics soften in the water of warm baths,
and beyond lie only cemeteries following cemeteries, and
in their midst, still without wind, the birch forest,
whether the sun is the oil lamp crumbling bread
or the gleam chipped into the walls of Helsingør,
whether the plot of death is the same everywhere,
be it in Santa Maria's flute or Tallinn's bagpiper,
it's because we modulate in one place what weighed from another.
even unintentionally, as shadows drift apart,
we weave nothing more than the line of chances and hits
that a current guides, each one, individually,
to the most sensitive passage of completion.
even isolating places in a laborious function,
detailing their divergences, and the farthest ends
— the likeness between what they are and what we thought them to be,
even in regions traversed by lengthy trains,

in what we're repeatedly led towards,
longing for what may reveal itself beyond the next cove,

"tempo circular
na sombra das folhas de nossos passos
sob um manto de nuvens o dia escureceu; o outono
gerou e apagou novas e efémeras
constelações, e à janela, olhando os cumes nevados ao
longe envoltos no orvalho de um doce sofrimento,
nossos olhos envelheceram; as nossas lembranças e aqueles
que amámos teceram palavras esquecidas; e a vida,
seguindo e caindo sem fim, pareceu apagar-se
como espuma numa recordação fugaz, um bloco de gelo,
transparente, esculpindo e transformando os aspectos do tempo ou
que os gansos agarravam com as asas as frágeis
penas do seu ser, as faziam estilhaçar.
mas era justamente por os anos passados pesarem
sobre nós, voltarem, ou desaparerem, que as terras e os
vales se sentia que suspiravam, que marcavam grãos de areia
no rosto, como outrora em connemara; que se sentia que a natureza
estava prestes a transformar-se, que a nossa sombra estava
prestes a desaparecer; que a neve caía, ia caindo, a neve dos teixos
deixando passar a neve; e que o inverno chegava com
as suas raízes escoradas pela água, e que a ronda do ano
dava outra volta fortuita na charneca, outra volta
na primavera e no verão; outro sopro do seu espírito, como um
gerânio que as pétalas desenham num curso incessante, invisível, e caíssem
na cratera da inocência, dos que vivem, dos que morrem.","circular time

snow dusted peaks robed in sweet suffering dew,

we loved weaved a forgotten word; and life,

about to disappear; the snow was falling, kept falling, the yew snow
letting the snow through; and winter arrived with
its roots dipped in water, and the turn of the year

na hora em que eu mais ruía
o sol aplainava o relvado, palmeiras
ondulavam num lago turvo
longe o escaravelho porvindoiro
que as reduziu a um coto
assemelhando-as a um ananás que degrada hoje
pelos jardins
o repuxo animava sem triunfo o pântano
da juventude
as varandas em fogo
o verão começando pelo fim
horas extraordinárias aquelas
em que as aves adiavam o repouso por causa
dos insectos do turno sequente
ourados absortos estrepitantes
a hora em que mais ninguém deitava como eu
a bicicleta sobre a falta
e se sentava na relva prendendo as lágrimas
as mãos tapando o rosto o rosto entre os geolhos e uma
roda atrás a girar
não havia o ecrã de bolso oportuno
era inevitável encarar o que não tem conserto
nem nunca terá
era do dia o instante altíloquo
uma harmónica crepitava nos auscultadores
feria de morte o touro da tarde
esse búfalo ermo que se aparta da manada
para ficar-se
os subidos candeeiros acendiam
havia um muro recém pintado
sujo já por um grafito de província
um cão passava ao largo levantava o focinho ao
perfume dos jantares
que chegava de onde
se entrevia o espalha-cor dos televisores
havia o farrapo de lua
como flanela posta sobre a ganga das alturas
agraudava os dós arrumados
na caixa do futuro
a hédera das extensões percorria aquela hora
uma ideia sulcava a charneca celeste
o coração alpinista no avesso dos volumes
rarefeito
o mundo era já uma seara de nojo
e fartura – belo desastroso feroz – lugar de forças
e destruições

puro intrínseco
procurava um celeiro urbano onde guardar
o ouro-sémen pronto a detonar
a libélula extrema o grilo inicial
a andorinha cujo ninho resulta de um cúmulo
de lama e ervas secas e rasoira

nas minhas costas o exíguo refrigério
da biblioteca pública

repousando da luta de guerrilha

that moment when i was really falling apart

billowed above the turbid lake
faraway the promised beetle

until they seemed like a pineapple which these days
rots in the gardens

the televisions’ color-blend rose in the air

like flannel sewn onto the denim of the heights

pure intrinsic
searched out an urban granary where i could keep

but reluctant enemy

o pequeno lumaréu que à boca do abrigo
longas frias horas crepitou
atufamos mochilas
testados couros e ataduras
aprumados os cabelos

fiapos de carne seca
tragos de café fumegante

sondar esta parte sujada do lugar

planará por ravinas desfiladeiros
misturado com o pó e o estrépito dos cascos com que
erramos à beira dos abismos

se acanhará

dos penhascos –

i’m watching her:
sweet the alp in the angle of her jaw
when she wakes
the canvas soaked at dawn
the grass outside darkens just as the sun rising
dilutes sleep
the mules feed off the fleeting
boreal pastures
before us a way opens up
luminously
glued to keeping quiet
to moving
but a breeze already inflames
making us want for a lake, placing
a range on the horizon
a less uncrossable elevation
than the lowlands of lived life
we say goodbye to the humid moss
fingered between thighs
stir the last pleasure out of the little
campfire that crackled
at the shelter’s opening through the long cold hours
we stuff rucksacks
leather and straps tested
we fixed our hair
munch a bit of flour
shredded bits of jerky
swigs of steaming coffee
we, the soldiers of alexander
whom nights of whiskey never fell
whose boots don’t weigh a thing
nor shame the fevers
the rectangle left by the tent
will remain for a while marking the plot of grass
stones ringing what had been
a scintillating flame later gone dark
now pasture to the scent of the timid
animals that will wander in
sounding out this sullied bit of the scene
at this very moment our scent
sails through narrow ravines
mixed with the dust and the clamor of hoofs that brings us
straying close on the edge of precipices
our own echoing
will embarrass us
but within – more silence even than the gorse
on the cliff sides –
and hardened, soaked with mist, atypical
arching over our maps
opening compasses
jotting quick notes about the way
and the error
more goat than us more mountainous: life
this leather hard to tan",pt_XX,en_XX,"[annemarie schwarzenbach]
I gaze upon her:
the sweet apex at the angle of her jaw
as she awakens
the canvas soaked in dawn
beyond, the grass stains as much as the starry vault
diluting the slumber
mules feeding on the fatuous
northern pastures
before us, a path articulates
illuminating
adhering to the silence
to the movement
yet already a breath ignites
restoring to us the desire for a lake, setting
the mountain range on the horizon
an elevation less impassable
than the plain of the lived
we bid farewell to the moist moss
traced between thighs
we shake off what remains of pleasure
the faint glow that at the shelter's mouth
creaked for long, cold hours
we stuff our backpacks
tested leathers and bindings
hair neatly arranged
we bring to our teeth a bit of flour
strands of dried meat
sips of steaming coffee
we, soldiers of Alexander
to whom the whiskey of evenings never fell
and the boots do not weigh
nor do the fevers shame
the rectangle where the tent lingered
will be marked for a time in the grass
with the stones surrounding what once was
the flickering flame that later darkened
and is fodder for the timid
fauna that will come
to probe this soiled part of the place
by then, our scent
will drift through ravines and gorges
mixed with dust and the clatter of hooves with which
we wander on the brink of abysses
we will produce echoes that our modesty
will shy away from
but within – more taciturn than the roar
of cliffs –
and harsh, arid, rare
arching the gaze over maps
unveiling compasses
making small notes about the course
and the deceit
more goat than us, more mountainous: life

metade solar outra metade
adentrada na noite que divide e reparte irmãmente os dois
pedaços da mesma ideia:
redonda achatada nos polos insegura no seu tombo
escuridão afora
a cabeça pendular metida entre ombros
sombras
na órbita do absurdo a cumprir a curvatura que lhe cabe
errando distorcendo a silenciosa
nitidez dos hemisférios
enfeitada de gázeos, orifícios, rodeada
de visíveis

muito depois, tortuosos
brincando de se mostrar de se encobrir na açoteia
dos eventos
onde uma língua lambe partículas, intenta locuções
ou a mudez dos vaga-lumes
mas tudo de tudo se afasta
por mais que um braço nosso se retese para o nada
partindo do centro, desalcançando
e o todo se despenhe, móbil
veloz rebobinado, o retroverso inteiro, e vejamos passar
pelo buraco de uma agulha o camelo
do raciocínio
e neva nesta geometria
tanto
resplandece muito como se às mãos um lume
viesse entreter as trevas

queimando as ervas
enterrando os sinais
inclinando a esfera do pensamento para a água
seguimos por pequenas pistas ano a ano
menos nítidas
o sono alaga submerge com um peso nocturno

é no sossego de um quarto extinto rumoroso
que a nossa esfera abate na mole dos seus fantasmas

a outra e à única claridade
e nesse vácuo ou abertura nesse
floco de neve ampliado uma magnólia floresce e floresce

à potestade
enquanto o lugar das medidas dos medos e das merdas
arrefece na lâmpada do tecto
aquietam-se em ocultas complexidões as ondas
órfãs do disjuntor
frequentam vibrações fabulares exteriores à evidência

half solar the other half
plunged in night that divides and fraternally shares two
scraps of the same idea:
round flattened at the poles insecure in its fall
out of darkness
the pendular head sunk between shoulders
shadows
the orbit of the absurd fulfilling its incumbent curvature
wandering distorting the silent
clarity of hemispheres
festooned in eyes of beryl, orifices, surrounded
by visibilities
panoramas breaking off that linger
long afterwards, coiling
a game of veiling and unveiling on the rooftop terrace
of events
where a tongue licks particles, proffers phrases
or the muteness of fireflies
but everything scatters from everything else
even though we thrust an arm into the void
out from the center, it’s thwarted
and everything crashes, velocious
mobile rewinding, an utter retroversion, and we can see
the camel of reason
pass through the eye of a needle
and it snows in this geometry
such
resplendence really as though a flame were handed to us
to fill the darkness
this is how we are upon the the face of the earth
burning the weeds
burying the signs
tipping the sphere of thinking into the water
each year we go down a series of narrow paths
ever dimmer
inundated, sleep is submerged under nocturnal weight
the body shudders with anonymity
it’s in the calm of a room humming with death
that our sphere falls into its crowd of ghosts
the ceiling opens on the celestial fire
on a different, a singular clarity
and in this emptiness, this opening, in this
high burgeoning snowflake a magnolia blooms and blooms
the immense sequoia of the world retires
to its dominion
while dimensions of fear and crap cool in their own venue
the naked bulb in the middle of the ceiling
the orphan waves of the circuit breaker are hushed
in hidden complexities
attend to fable-like vibrations beyond evidence
fade

erupted in the heavy breath of alveoli

shines brightly as if a flame
came to entertain the darkness in our hands

the other and only clarity

amplified snowflake a magnolia blooms and blooms
the immense sequoia of the world gathers
to the power

cools in the ceiling lamp
hidden complexities quiet in the waves

frequent fabulous vibrations external to evidence

nas nossas ruas, ao anoitecer,
há tal soturnidade, há tal melancolia,
que as sombras, o bulício, o tejo, a maresia
despertam-me um desejo absurdo de sofrer.
o céu parece baixo e de neblina,
o gás extravasado enjoa-me, perturba;
e os edifícios, com as chaminés, e a turba
toldam-se duma cor monótona e londrina.
batem carros de aluguer, ao fundo,
levando à via-férrea os que se vão. felizes!
ocorrem-me em revista exposições, países:
madrid, paris, berlim, s. petersburgo, o mundo!
semelham-se a gaiolas, com viveiros,
as edificações somente emadeiradas:
como morcegos, ao cair das badaladas,
saltam de viga em viga os mestres carpinteiros.
voltam os calafates, aos magotes,
de jaquetão ao ombro, enfarruscados, secos;
embrenho-me, a cismar, por boqueirões, por becos,
ou erro pelos cais a que se atracam botes.
e evoco, então, as crónicas navais:
mouros, baixéis, heróis, tudo ressuscitado!
luta camões no sul, salvando um livro a nado!
singram soberbas naus que eu não verei jamais!
e o fim da tarde inspira-me; e incomoda!
de um couraçado inglês vogam os escaleres;
e em terra num tinir de louças e talheres
flamejam, ao jantar alguns hotéis da moda.
num trem de praça arengam dois dentistas;
um trôpego arlequim braceja numas andas;
os querubins do lar flutuam nas varandas;
às portas, em cabelo, enfadam-se os lojistas!
vazam-se os arsenais e as oficinas;
reluz, viscoso, o rio, apressam-se as obreiras;
e num cardume negro, hercúleas, galhofeiras,
correndo com firmeza, assomam as varinas.
vêm sacudindo as ancas opulentas!
seus troncos varonis recordam-me pilastras;
e algumas, à cabeça, embalam nas canastras
os filhos que depois naufragam nas tormentas.

desde manhã à noite, a bordo das fragatas;
e apinham-se num bairro aonde miam gatas,
e o peixe podre gera os focos de infecção!

que mortifica e deixa umas loucuras mansas!
o aljube, em que hoje estão velhinhas e crianças,
bem raramente encerra uma mulher de “dom”!
e eu desconfio, até, de um aneurisma
tão mórbido me sinto, ao acender das luzes;
à vista das prisões, da velha sé, das cruzes,
chora-me o coração que se enche e que se abisma.
a espaços, iluminam-se os andares,
e as tascas, os cafés, as tendas, os estancos
alastram em lençol os seus reflexos brancos;
e a lua lembra o circo e os jogos malabares.
duas igrejas, num saudoso largo,
lançam a nódoa negra e fúnebre do clero:
nelas esfumo um ermo inquisidor severo,
assim que pela história eu me aventuro e alargo.
na parte que abateu no terremoto,
muram-me as construções rectas, iguais, crescidas;
afrontam-me, no resto, as íngremes subidas,
e os sinos dum tanger monástico e devoto.
mas, num recinto público e vulgar,
com bancos de namoro e exíguas pimenteiras,
brônzeo, monumental, de proporções guerreiras,
um épico doutrora ascende, num pilar!
e eu sonho o cólera, imagino a febre,
nesta acumulação de corpos enfezados;
sombrios e espectrais recolhem os soldados;
inflama-se um palácio em face de um casebre.

dos arcos dos quartéis que foram já conventos;

derramam-se por toda a capital, que esfria.

enlutam-me, alvejando, as tuas elegantes,
curvadas a sorrir às montras dos ourives.

descem dos magasins, causam-me sobressaltos;
custa-lhes a elevar os seus pescoços altos
e muitas delas são comparsas ou coristas.

eu acho sempre assunto a quadros revoltados:
entro na brasserie; às mesas de emigrados,
ao riso e à crua luz joga-se o dominó.

passeios de lajedo arrastam-se as impuras.

um sopro que arripia os ombros quase nus.
cercam-me as lojas, tépidas. eu penso
ver círios laterais, ver filas de capelas,
com santos e fiéis, andores, ramos, velas,
em uma catedral de um comprimento imenso.
as burguesinhas do catolicismo
resvalam pelo chão minado pelos canos;
e lembram-me, ao chorar doente dos pianos,
as freiras que os jejuns matavam de histerismo.
num cutileiro, de avental, ao torno,
um forjador maneja um malho, rubramente;
e de uma padaria exala-se, inda quente,
um cheiro salutar e honesto a pão no forno.
e eu que medito um livro que exacerbe,
quisera que o real e a análise mo dessem;
casas de confecções e modas resplandecem;
pelas vitrines olha um ratoneiro imberbe.

que espartilhada escolhe uns xales com debuxo!
sua excelência atrai, magnética, entre luxo,
que ao longo dos balcões de mogno se amontoa.

a sua traîne imita um leque antigo, aberto,
nas barras verticais, a duas tintas. perto,

desdobram-se tecidos estrangeiros;
plantas ornamentais secam nos mostradores;
flocos de pós de arroz pairam sufocadores,
e em nuvens de cetins requebram-se os caixeiros.
mas tudo cansa! apagam-se nas frentes
os candelabros, como estrelas, pouco a pouco;
da solidão regouga um cauteleiro rouco;
tornam-se mausoléus as armações fulgentes.

um parafuso cai nas lajes, às escuras:
colocam-se taipais, rangem as fechaduras,
e os olhos dum caleche espantam-me, sangrentos.
e eu sigo, como as linhas de uma pauta
a dupla correnteza augusta das fachadas;
pois sobem, no silêncio, infaustas e trinadas,
as notas pastoris de uma longínqua flauta.
se eu não morresse, nunca! e eternamente
buscasse e conseguisse a perfeição das cousas!
esqueço-me a prever castíssimas esposas,
que aninhem em mansões de vidro transparente!
ó nossos filhos! que de sonhos ágeis,
pousando, vos trarão a nitidez às vidas!

numas habitações translúcidas e frágeis.

e as frotas dos avós, e os nómadas ardentes,
nós vamos explorar todos os continentes
e pelas vastidões aquáticas seguir!

sem árvores, no vale escuro das muralhas!...
julgo avistar, na treva, as folhas das navalhas
e os gritos de socorro ouvir estrangulados.
e nestes nebulosos corredores
nauseiam-me, surgindo, os ventres das tabernas;
na volta, com saudade, e aos bordos sobre as pernas,
cantam, de braço dado, uns tristes bebedores.
eu não receio, todavia, os roubos;
afastam-se, a distância, os dúbios caminhantes;
e sujos, sem ladrar, ósseos, febris, errantes,
amareladamente, os cães parecem lobos.
e os guardas, que revistam as escadas,
caminham de lanterna e servem de chaveiros;
por cima, as imorais, nos seus roupões ligeiros,

vespers
when evening falls across our streets
and sullen melancholy fills the air,
the tagus, the tang, the shadows and bustle
bring me an absurd desire to suffer.
the sky hangs low and seems all hazy;
the gas from the streetlamps makes me queasy;
the tumult of buildings, chimneys and people
is cloaked in a dullish, londonish hue.
oh lucky travellers in hired coaches
now hieing to the railway station! countries
and exhibitions file past me: madrid,
paris, berlin, st petersburg, the world!
the timber frames of future buildings
resemble cages for keeping animals;
like swooping bats the carpenters leap
from beam to beam at the sound of the bell.
clusters of callous, tar-smeared caulkers
return from the slipways, coats on their shoulders;
i wander through alleys that lead to the river
or walk by the wharves where boats are docked.
i evoke the ocean chronicles: the moors,
old vessels and heroes – all resurrected!
shipwrecked camões swims his book to shore! (1)
great carracks that i’ll never see ride the waves!
the twilight inspires, and also disturbs me!
an english battleship launches its cutters
while swank hotels on land bedazzle
with china and flatware clinking at dinner.
two dentists argue inside a streetcar;
a clumsy clown is struggling on stilts;
children flit, like cherubs, on balconies;
hatless, bored shopkeepers wait at their doors!
the shipyards and workshops are emptying out;
the river glints thickly, the workwomen hurry;
and a black school of herculean fishwives
bursts out of nowhere, joking, laughing.
wagging sumptuous hips they come!
their manly torsos remind me of pillars;
and some, in the baskets on their heads,
rock sons who’ll one day drown in storms.
on frigates – barefoot! – they unload coal (2)
from dawn to dusk, then crowd together
in a neighbourhood where cats meow
and the rotting fish breed infection!
ii
after dark
prisoners bang on the bars of their cells –
a sound that rattles my nerves with shame!
the aljube jail, for old women and children,
rarely encloses a titled lady!
i feel so ill as the lights come on
i worry i might have an aneurysm;
the sight of the jails, crosses, cathedral,
fills and sinks my heart with tears.
one floor after another lights up,
and cafés, restaurants, tobacco and other shops
spread like a sheet their white reflections.
the moon brings jugglers, the circus, to mind.
on an ancient square two churches raise
the clergy’s black, funereal spectre;
i sketch there a lonely, dour inquisitor,
daring to extend myself into history.
in quarters which the earthquake flattened
equal, straight buildings wall me in; (3)
everywhere else i face steep streets
and the tolling of pious, monastic bells.
but gracing a common, public square
with lovers’ benches and lithe pepper trees
a war-sized monument cast in bronze
stands, on a pillar, for an epic that was! (4)
and in this assemblage of stunted bodies
i think of the fever, imagine the cholera;
returning soldiers look sombre as ghosts;
a gleaming palace stands opposite a hovel.
mounted patrolmen set out from the archways
of army barracks that once were convents;
the middle ages! others, on foot,
range through the capital, now turning cold.
sad town! i dread you’ll arouse a dead passion
in me! i mourn upon seeing your elegant
ladies so white in the lamp-lit distance,
leaning and smiling at jewellers’ windows.
coming down from the department stores,
the florists and dressmakers wrench my gut;
they’re hardly able to hold up their heads,
and many are walk-ons and chorus girls.
even in sordid human tableaus
i, with my pince-nez, find subject matter:
i enter the beerhouse; at the immigrants’ tables,
harshly lit, they laugh and play dominoes.
iii
by gaslight
and i go back out. the night’s weight crushes.
impure women roam the sidewalks.
o languid hospitals! ill-clad shoulders
shiver from drafts where streets open up.
warm shops surround me. i think i’m seeing
flanking candles, rows of chapels
with saints and the faithful, flowers, more candles,
more saints, in a vastly long cathedral.
the bourgeois women of catholicism
slip on the ground that’s tunnelled by drainpipes.
to me they recall, with their whining pianos,
the nuns who, fasting, died of madness.
an aproned knife maker, working the lathe,
redhotly wields his blacksmith’s hammer;
and bread, still warm, from the baker’s oven
sends forth its honest, wholesome smell.
and i, whose goal is a book that galls,
want it to show and examine what’s real.
boutiques shine with the latest fashions;
a street urchin gapes at their window displays.
o long descents! could i but paint
with skilled, sincere, salubrious verses
the delicate shimmering of your streetlamps
and all your romantic moonlit pallor!
that sensual, corseted creature selecting
printed shawls – she moves like a snake!
her excellence is a magnet amidst
the finery piled on mahogany counters.
and that old dame with coiled plaits!
her train with its vertical, two-tone stripes
mocks a spread fan! her mecklenburg horses
wait with the carriage, pawing the pavement.
decorative plants wilt on the tables
where clerks unroll their foreign fabrics;
in clouds of satins they bow and smile;
rice powder hovers and chokes the air.
but all grows weary! slowly, like stars,
the storefronts’ hanging lights go dim;
the glittering buildings become mausoleums;
a lone, hoarse voice hawks lottery tickets.
and there on a corner: “please, sir! take pity!”
whenever i pass him, that little old man,
bald and eternal, begs for alms:
the teacher at school who taught me latin!
iv
the dead hours
the lofty ceiling of air, of oxygen,
runs between the facing rooftops;
the stars’ tired eyes shed tears of light;
blue dreams of transmigration exalt me.
below all that, what portals! what streets!
i hear, in the dark, a screw hit the ground,
the clacking of shutters, the jangle of locks;
and the bloodshot eyes of a buggy scare me.
i follow, like lines on a music stave,
the stately double row of façades
while pastoral notes from a distant flute
trill, in the silence, a gloomy warning.
oh, if i’d never die! if forever
i’d seek and attain the perfection of things!
i lose myself envisioning wives
who chastely nest in clear-glass mansions!
dear sons! what swift dreams, alighting,
will bring sharp clarity to your lives!
i want the mothers and sisters you love
to live in luminous, fragile homes.
ah! like our grandfathers’ fleets, like fervent
nomads, like the ruddy race to come, (5)
we’ll go and explore every continent
and sail across the watery expanses!
but how, if we live enclosed by stone
in a dark and treeless valley of walls?
i think i see knives flash in the shadows
and hear a strangled cry for help.
and along these murky corridors
the taverns, if i peer in, appall me.
some sorry drunks are staggering home
and sing, arms joined, for old time’s sake.
but i’m not afraid of being robbed;
the dubious characters fall behind me.
the scrawny and mangy dogs don’t bark;
they look a little like yellowish wolves.
and those keepers of keys, the night watchmen,
scan with their lanterns each entryway;
above them loose women, in scanty robes,
smoke and cough at the balcony windows.

of tomblike buildings tall as hills,
human pain, like a baleful sea,

hail marys
in our streets, at nightfall,
such gloom, such melancholy,
that shadows, the bustle, the tejo, the sea air
awaken in me an absurd desire to suffer.
the sky seems low and misty,
the escaping gas sickens me, disturbs me;
and the buildings, with the chimneys, and the crowd
are veiled in a monotonous and london-like hue.
rental cars honk in the distance,
taking those who go. happy!
exhibitions, countries come to mind:
madrid, paris, berlin, st. petersburg, the world!
the buildings, only wooden structures,
resemble cages with aviaries:
like bats, at the tolling of the bells,
the master carpenters leap from beam to beam.
the caulkers return in droves,
with their jackets slung over their shoulders, charred and dry;
i wander, lost in thought, through alleyways, through lanes,
or wander along the docks where boats dock.
and then i evoke naval chronicles:
moors, galleys, heroes, all resurrected!
camões fights in the south, saving a book by swimming!
magnificent ships set sail that i will never see!
and the end of the evening inspires me; and troubles me!
from a british battleship row the cutters;
and on land, in the clattering of dishes and cutlery,
some trendy hotels blaze at dinner.
in a square, two dentists argue;
a stumbling harlequin brandishes crutches;
the cherubs of home float on balconies;
at the doors, the shopkeepers grow weary in their hair!
the arsenals and workshops empty out;
the river glistens, viscous, the workers hurry;
and in a black shoal, herculean, jocular,
running with determination, the fishwives emerge.
swaying their opulent hips!
their manly trunks remind me of pillars;
and some, balancing on their heads, cradle in baskets
the children who later perish in storms.
barefoot! in the coal unloading areas,
from morning till night, aboard the frigates;
they crowd into a district where cats meow,
and rotten fish breeds infection!

deep night
knocks on the bars, in the prisons. a sound
that torments and leaves a gentle madness!
the aljube, where today there are old women and children,
rarely holds a woman of ""dom""!
and i even suspect an aneurysm
i feel so morbid, as the lights come on;
at the sight of prisons, the old cathedral, the crosses,
my heart weeps, filling and sinking.
at intervals, the floors light up,
and the taverns, cafes, shops, and tobacco shops
spread their white reflections like a sheet;
and the moon recalls the circus and the juggling games.
two churches, in a nostalgic square,
cast the black and funereal stain of the clergy:
in them i conjure up a severe inquisitorial hermit,
whenever i venture into and expand history.
in the part that collapsed in the earthquake,
the straight, identical buildings wall me in;
the steep climbs challenge me in the rest,
and the bells toll in a monastic and devout tone.
but in a public and mundane setting,
with courting benches and small pepper trees,
bronze, monumental, of warlike proportions,
a former epic ascends on a column!
and i dream of cholera, imagine fever,
in this accumulation of sickly bodies;
dark and spectral, the soldiers withdraw;
a palace burns across from a hovel.
cavalry patrols depart
from the arches of the former convent barracks;
middle ages! some on foot, others at a slow pace,
spread through the entire cooling capital.
sad city! i fear you will rekindle
a dead passion in me! in the distance, the lampposts
mourn, casting light on your elegant figures,
bent and smiling at the jewelers' shop windows.
and more: the seamstresses, the florists
descend from the shops, startling me;
it's hard for them to lift their high necks,
and many of them are actresses or chorus girls.
and i, with a single-lens opera glass,
always find material for rebellious scenes;
i enter a brasserie; at the tables of emigrants,
dominoes are played amidst laughter and harsh light.

by gaslight
and i leave. the night weighs heavy, crushing. on
the cobblestone sidewalks the impure drag themselves.
o soft hospitals! from the doorways
a breath chills bare shoulders.
the shops surround me, warm. i imagine
side altars, rows of chapels,
with saints and worshippers, processions, branches, candles,
in a cathedral of immense length.
the catholic bourgeois girls
traverse a minefield littered with pipes;
and they remind me, as they cry over sick pianos,
of the nuns who died of hysteria from fasting.
in a cutlery shop, the blacksmith at his forge,
wields a hammer with a red-hot intensity;
and from a bakery, still warm,
a healthy and honest smell of baking bread wafts.
and as i contemplate a book that magnifies,
i wish reality and analysis would offer it to me;
houses of fashion and style gleam;
a young pickpocket eyes the windows.

the slender diffusion of your reflections,

that accumulates along the mahogany counters.

her train mimics an ancient, open fan,
in vertical bars, in two shades. nearby,

foreign fabrics are unfurled;
ornamental plants wither on display;
powder flakes hover oppressively,
and in clouds of satin, the shop assistants sway.

dim in the storefronts, like stars, little by little;
a hoarse ticket seller grumbles in solitude;
the glistening frames become mausoleums.

asks me for alms, an old man,

da estrada eu previa espiritualidade a essa torre de igreja

i toss in bed, uncomfortable on my right side, on my left side,

i’m universally uncomfortable, metaphysically uncomfortable,
but what’s even worse is my headache.
that’s more serious than the meaning of the universe.
once, while walking in the country around oxford,
i saw up ahead, beyond a bend in the road,
a church steeple towering above the houses of a hamlet or village.
the photographic image of that non-event has remained with me
like a horizontal wrinkle marring a trouser’s crease.
today it seems relevant...
from the road i associated that steeple with spirituality,
the faith of all ages, and practical charity.

"receita para fazer azul
se quiseres fazer azul,
pega num pedaço de céu e mete-o numa panela grande,
que possas levar ao lume do horizonte;
depois mexe o azul com um resto de vermelho
da madrugada, até que ele se desfaça;
despeja tudo num bacio bem limpo,
para que nada reste das impurezas da tarde.
por fim, peneira um resto de ouro da areia
do meio-dia, até que a cor pegue ao fundo de metal.
se quiseres, para que as cores se não desprendam
com o tempo, deita no líquido um caroço de pêssego queimado.
vê-lo-ás desfazer-se, sem deixar sinais de que alguma vez
ali o puseste; e nem o negro da cinza deixará um resto de ocre
na superfície dourada. podes, então, levantar a cor
até à altura dos olhos, e compará-la com o azul autêntico.
ambas as cores te parecerão semelhantes, sem que
possas distinguir entre uma e outra.
assim o fiz – eu, abraão ben judá ibn haim,
iluminador de loulé – e deixei a receita a quem quiser,
algum dia, imitar o céu.","recipe for making the colour blue
if you wish to make the colour blue
take a piece of sky and put it in a pot
large enough to place on the flame of the horizon.
stir into the blue a pinch of early morning red
until it dissolves. pour everything
into a brass bowl that has been well washed
to eliminate all of the afternoon’s impurities.
finally, sift in a few smidgens of gold from the sand
of midday until the colour adheres to the bottom of the bowl.
to prevent the colours from separating with time,
drop a charred peach pit into the liquid.
it will disintegrate, leaving no telltale
sign, not even – from the black ash – an ochre trace
on the golden surface. you may then raise the colour
to eye level and compare it with genuine blue.
the two colours will look so alike
that you cannot distinguish one from the other.

illuminator from the town of loulé. and i left the recipe
for whoever, one day, would imitate the sky.",pt_XX,en_XX,"Recipe for Making Blue

If you wish to make blue, my dear,
Take a piece of sky and put it near,
In a large pot, over the horizon's flame,
Mix the blue with a touch of red, same
As the dawn, until it fades from view.
Pour it all into a clean basin, so true,
To rid it of impurities of the day soon past.
Lastly, sift a bit of gold from the noon's cast,
Until the color adheres to the metal's base.
If you desire the colors to embrace
Eternally, in the liquid, a burnt peach pit drop,
Will keep the hues from fading or stop.
Watch it dissolve without a trace,
No ash will mar the golden grace.
Then lift the color to your eyes,
And compare it to the true blue skies.
Both hues will seem alike, serene,
Indistinguishable, as if in a dream.
Thus, did I, Abraham Ben Judah Ibn Haim,
The illuminator of Loulé, claim,
And left this recipe for those who aspire
To mimic the heavens' celestial fire.",0

for the images that come and go.",pt_XX,en_XX,"of things
not all things mark for us
time with tenacity, in their halos.
many hide or do not return to us
the thought with which we had wanted them.
oh imagined thing, reflection in water,
oh tank that contains the history of time,
hour by hour in the four seasons.
you have winter, summer, spring
and above all the perfect, so still, autumn.
and the myospora and the plum tree
not only give you the images of the image
but also throw loose petals at you
so that the archetype falls upon the image.
and not only from the plant kingdom the figures
visit your mirror, oh ancient tank,
but the fishes, the birds, and the insects
pass, in the whole time that you keep
the signs of the past and the present.
so many things passed without my remembering
that we pass, only this water
still in its circle and flowing
has a mobile and immobile force
that pulls me from age to age.
it continually gushes and flows through the gutter
shallow to the ground, spread in the fields.
and time is spent like water
that never holds the same mirror
for the images that come and go.",0
