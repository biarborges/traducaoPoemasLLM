"da menina e moça
pensando-vos estou filha
vossa mãe me está lembrando
enchem-se-me os olhos d’água
nela vos estou lavando:
nascestes filha antre mágoa
para bem filha vos seja
que no vosso nascimento
vos ouve a fortuna inveja:
morto era o contentamento
nenhuma alegria ouvistes,
vossa mãe era finada,
nos outras éamos tristes:
nada em dor em dor crescida
não sei onde isto há de ir ter
vejo-vos filha fermosa
cos olhos verdes crescer:
não era esta graça vossa
para nascer em desterro
mal haja a desaventura
que pôs mais nisto que o erro:
tinha aqui sua sepultura
vossa mãe e mágoa a nós
não éreis vos filha não
para morrerem por vós:
não houve em fados razão
nem se consente rogar
de vosso pai hei mor dó
que de si s’á de queixar:
eu vos ouvi a vós só
primeiro que outrem ninguém
não fôreis vós seu não fora
não sei se fiz mal se bem:
mas não pode ser senhora
para mal nenhum nascerdes
com este riso gracioso
que tendes sobr’olhos verdes:
conforto mais duvidoso
me é este que tomo assi
deus voos dê milhor ventura
da que tevestes té ‘qui:
que a dita e a fermosura
dizem patranhas antigas
que pelejaram um dia
sendo dantes muito amigas:
muitos hão que é fantasia
eu que vi tempos e anos
nenhuma cousa duvido
como ela é caso de danos:
mas nenhum mal nom é crido
o bem só é esperado
e na crença e na esperança
em ambas há i mudança
em ambas há i cuidado","from menina e moça
i’m thinking of you, dear girl,
your mother’s memory haunts me.
my eyes fill up with tears,
they are bathing you gently.
you were born amid sorrow—
may it yet prove a blessing.
since fortune, struck with envy,
singled you out at birth.
gone forever was contentment,
you heard no joyful voices.
your mother’s life had ended,
while ours went on in sadness.
in anguish born and raised!
i don’t know where all this is going.
i’ve watched you grow, my girl,
with green eyes so lovely.
beauty like yours wasn’t meant
to be born in exile. curses on
fate! this was clearly a work
of malevolence, not a mistake.
here lies your mother,
and we languish in grief.
you did nothing, my girl,
to incur a loss so great.
the fates spurn reason,
and will admit no protest.
i pity your poor father,
for the pain he must lament.
i heard you crying, alone,
before anyone else. you’d not
be here, had i not been there.
still, i ask if i did right.
but surely it can’t be wrong
for you to have been born
with that elegant smile of yours,
those dazzling green eyes.
it’s an unlikely comfort
that i take for myself.
may god grant you the grace
that has eluded you till now.
beauty and good fortune,
or so the old story goes,
were once the best of friends,
but became bitterly opposed.
many hold that it’s fantasy,
but in my life i’ve seen
enough not to doubt it:
fate inflicts great damage.
no harm is ever believed;
we always expect the good.
in hoping and believing
lies an element of change,
an element of concern.",pt_XX,en_XX,"Of the girl and young lady
thinking of you, daughter
your mother is reminding me
my eyes fill with tears
I am washing you in her:
you were born a daughter amidst sorrow
may it be for your good as a daughter
that at your birth
fortune envied you:
happiness was dead
you heard no joy,
your mother was gone,
we were all sad:
nothing in pain, growing in pain
I don't know where this will end up
I see you, beautiful daughter,
growing with green eyes:
this grace was not meant for you
to be born in exile
cursed be the misfortune
that put more in this than the mistake:
your mother had her grave here
and sorrow to us
you were not her daughter, no,
for them to die for you:
there was no reason in fate
nor is it allowed to plead
for your father I have more sorrow
for him to complain about himself:
I heard you only
before anyone else, no one else
you were not his, it was not
I do not know if I did wrong or right:
but it cannot be, lady,
for you to be born into any ill
with this graceful smile
you have beneath green eyes:
this comfort is more uncertain
that I take in this way
may God give you a better fortune
than what you have had so far:
for happiness and beauty
say old lies
that once fought, being very friendly before:
many say it is fantasy
I, who have seen times and years
doubt nothing
how it is a matter of harm:
but no evil is believed
only good is awaited
and in belief and hope
there is change in both
there is care in both.",4
"porque o melhor, enfim,
é não ouvir nem ver…
passarem sobre mim
e nada me doer!
— sorrindo interiormente,
co’as pálpebras cerradas,
às águas da torrente
já tão longe passadas. —
rixas, tumultos, lutas,
não me fazerem dano...
alheio às vãs labutas,
às estações do ano.

a poda, a cava, e a redra,
e eu dormindo um sono
debaixo duma pedra.
melhor até se o acaso
o leito me reserva
no prado extenso e raso
apenas sob a erva
que abril copioso ensope…
e, esbelto, a intervalos
fustigue-me o galope
de bandos de cavalos.
ou no serrano mato,
a brigas tão propício,
onde o viver ingrato
dispõe ao sacrifício
das vidas, mortes duras
ruam pelas quebradas,
com choques de armaduras
e tinidos de espadas…
ou sob o piso, até,
infame e vil da rua,
onde a torva ralé
irrompe, tumultua,
se estorce, vocifera,
selvagem nos conflitos,
com ímpetos de fera
nos olhos, saltos, gritos…
roubos, assassinatos!
horas jamais tranquilas,
em brutos pugilatos
fraturam-se as maxilas...
e eu sob a terra firme,
compacta, recalcada,
muito quietinho. a rir-me
de não me doer nada.","in the end, it’s better
in the end, it’s better
not to hear or see…
to feel no pain at all
as all passes over me!
inwardly smiling,
eyelids closed,
at the floodwaters
off in the distance.
brawls, tussles, feuds,
all doing me no harm…
now a stranger to useless labor,
to the changing seasons.
summer passes, then autumn,
shearing, ploughing, hoeing—
while i sleep soundly,
underneath a rock.
better still if fortune
reserves a bed for me
in a wide meadow,
just beneath the grass
that april generously soaks…
and a band of horses
to pummel me now and then
with their gallant trotting.
or on the scrubby hills
where skirmishes play out,
where worthless life
assents to the sacrifice
of the living, bitter deaths
sweeping down the ravine,
to the crack of gunshot
and the clang of swords…
or even beneath
the mean, grubby streets
where the frightful throng
erupts in a tumult…
loudly jostling
in savage conflict,
feral gleams in their eyes,
leaping and shouting!
thievery and murder!
never a moment of peace
as jawbones shatter
in scrappy fistfights…
and i, so very still
beneath the tamped earth,
laughing so hard
because it doesn’t hurt.",pt_XX,en_XX,"Because the finest way,
is not to see or hear…
Let them pass over my bay,
and feel no pain, my dear!
— Smiling deep within,
with eyelids shut tight,
to the waters rushing in,
already out of sight. —
Fights, tumult, strife,
could never harm my core...
unfazed by the toil of life,
or the changing of the floor.
Summer, autumn fleeting,
pruning, tilling, never near,
and I, in slumber greeting
beneath a rock so clear.
Even better if by chance
my resting place is found
in a meadow, vast expanse,
beneath fresh green, the ground
soaked by April's rain…
and there, slender and free,
let the galloping refrain
of horse herds reach out to me.
Or in the mountain's wild,
where battles fiercely brew,
life's harshness reconciled
to sacrifice anew,
souls, in hard deaths, tumbled
down the rugged slope,
with armor clashing crumbled
and swords in clanging scope…
Or beneath the streets, so low,
infamous and mean,
where the mob's dark glow
erupts, a raging scene,
twisting, shouting wild,
ferocious in their brawl,
like beasts, unreconciled,
in eyes, leaps, and call…
Robberies, murders, tales!
Never a tranquil hour,
in brutish, fateful pales
shattering jaw in power...
But I, beneath firm ground,
dense and tightly pressed,
so quietly profound,
laughing, unoppressed.",4

[sobre a fotografia de uma criança encontrada morta numa praia da turquia]
o meu pai chamou-me e pediu-me que escolhesse
um brinquedo – só um – de que gostasse muito; e
que separasse outro brinquedo para o aylan, que
ainda não sabia escolher, mas só um, e tinha de
ser pequeno. o meu pai explicou-me que nessa
noite ia fazer de tudo quase nada numa trouxa
leve; porque assim, quando o aylan e eu caíssemos
de sono, ele e a minha mãe poderiam levar-nos ao
colo sem ficarem para trás. havia lágrimas nos olhos
do meu pai quando contou que, na manhã seguinte,
teríamos de deixar a nossa terra; mas logo se
recompôs, dizendo que kobanî também já não era
bem a nossa terra, que a nossa casa era a ruína da
nossa casa, que toda a síria não passava de um tímpano
exausto de tanto estrondo e dois olhos cansados,
mas tão cansados, de chamas e de sangue. o meu pai
achava que o aylan era demasiado pequeno para
compreender e, por isso, dissera-lhe apenas que
iríamos dar um passeio de barco, que passaríamos
o dia numa praia e que, enquanto eu e a minha mãe
nadássemos no mar até ficarmos sem fôlego, ele
podia simplesmente deitar-se de bruços na areia,
como tanto gostava. o meu pai nunca nos mentiu.","lungs

a toy – just one – that i liked the most; and
to pick out another toy for aylan, who
was still too young to choose, but just one, and
it had to be small. my father told me that
tonight he’d wrap up our things in a light
bundle; this way, once aylan and i fell
asleep, he and my mother could carry us
without staying behind. there were tears in my father’s
eyes when he said that, tomorrow morning,
we’d have to leave our land; but he quickly
pulled it together, saying kobanî wasn’t really
our land anymore, that our home was the ruins
of our home, that all of syria was nothing but an eardrum
exhausted from all the noise and two eyes, tired,
so tired, of seeing flames and blood. my father
thought aylan was too little to
understand, so he just told him that
we were going on a boat ride, that we’d spend
the day on a beach and that, while my mother and i
swam in the sea until we were breathless, he
could simply lie face down in the sand,

bem remanesce no contorno puído de cidades

viemos de longe, de patíbulos que ninguém contará,
evocando pontos brumosos e vagas escolhas,
a custo apartados da dor de uma época a outra sobrepondo-se,
para ver enfim esquivas as mansardas donde partimos
– ainda a maioria sorria nos terreiros, tantos anos –
e perceber que o caminho se faz lançando mão
ao que dele continuamente resvala, inaudível – apagando-se.

Evoking misty points and vague choices,
Barely separated from the pain of one era overlapping another,

and understand that the path is made by grasping
what continuously slips away from it, inaudible - fading.

“que só nos convirá em sorte acenar, acenar sempre, e sem remorso,
pois que é no que perdido foi que fomos deixando que se viva.”

regressa e entrar humildemente por engano pela morte dentro

reaching from the city’s houses and din
