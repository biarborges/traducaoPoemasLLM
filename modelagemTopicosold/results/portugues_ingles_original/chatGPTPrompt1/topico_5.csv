"carta ao pai
agora que o senhor
mais assemelha pedaço
de carne com dois olhos
dirigidos ao teto escuro
no leito em que provável
só não há-de morrer só
porque nem a própria
saliva poderá engolir
por si na companhia
somente desta sonda
que o alimenta
me pergunto se ainda
em validade a proibição
da mãe em confessar
ao senhor os hábitos
amorosos das mucosas
que são minhas
e se deveras me amaria
tanto menos soubesse
quanta fricção já tiveram
que não lhes cabia
biológica ou religiosa
-mente e se também
pediria para sua filhoa
a morte que desejou
a tantos de minha laia
quando surgiam na tela
da glboo da record
da manchete do sbt
que sempre constituíram
seu cordão umbilical
com a tradição
e se deveras faria
sobrevir a eles
grande destruição
pela violência
com que urrava
seus xingamentos
típicos de macho
nascido no interior
desse pais de machos
interiores e quebrados
em seus orgulhos falhos
de crer que o pai
é o que abarrota
geladeiras e não deixa
que falte à mesa
o alimento que nutre
as mesmas mucosas
em que corre
o seu sangre
mas não seu deus
e ora neste leito partido
o cérebro em veias
como riachos insistentes
em correr
fora das margens
se o senhor
soubesse o dolo
com que manchei
a mesa
de todos os patriarcas
ainda pergunto-me
se me receberia
com a mansidão
que aceita na testa
o beijo desta sua filhoa
que nada mais é
que a sua imagem
e semelhança invertidas
tal espelho
que refletisse opostos
de gênero e religião
ou o desenho
animado na infância
de uma sala de justiça
onde numa tela
podia-se observar
um mundo ao avesso
e se o pai e o pai
odeiam deveras
o gerado nas normas
da biologia e religião
mais tarde porém geridos
na transgressão das leis
que o pai e o pai
impõem-nos na ciência
de sermos todos falhos
nessa terra onde procriar
é tão frequente
que gere prazer
nenhum e olho

com essas pupilas
que talvez jamais
reflitam o pai
mas ora veem o pai
eu
mesmo pedaço
de carne
com dois olhos
peço perdão
em silêncio
pois sequer posso
dizer que não
mais há tempo

pelo medo adversativo
de talvez abalar

on the forehead from

as reflects opposites
of gender and religion

from my childhood
of a hall of justice

you could watch a world gone wrong

"morticínio ancestral
quando minha avó torcia o pescoço
dos frangos, não raras vezes
chegando a decapitá-los,
e os lançava ao chão frio de cimento
para aquela dança assustadora,
não havia em seu rosto
paixão, prazer, ou pena.
na escuridão escondida dentro do meio-dia,
aqueles morticínios eram os atos
mais honestos na violência
daquela casa e daquela infância.
afogando na água fervente
os cadáveres sem cabeça
[que ficara de banda no quintal
interrogando seu criador],
ela passava a depená-los, ágil,
qual fosse ela um gavião-pedrês.
como o cafuné do crânio da onça
no crânio da capivara,
ou o abraço anelar das garras do carcará
ao redor do corpo todo-torso da cobra,
nada naquela velha
era cogitado
para além da missão simples:
alimentar a prole.
como todo animal que não questiona
a cadeia alimentar diante da fome,
minha avó foi o bicho mais inocente
da minha casa e da minha selva.
mais do que os gatos e pombos,
mais do que os jabutis e coelhos,
com certeza
era mais inocente minha avó
do que as cachorras da casa,
aquelas cachorras grandes e gordas
com os dentes afiados — mas inúteis,
esperando também daquela mamífera-anciã
que manchasse ela as mãos de sangue.","ancestral slaughter
when my grandmother used to wring
the necks of chickens, not infrequently
to the point of decapitation,
and dropped them to the cold cement floor
and that shocking dance,
on her face there was no trace
of passion, pleasure, or pity.
in the darkness hidden within the noonday,
those killings were the most honest acts
in the violence of that house,
that childhood.
after plunging into boiling water
those headless corpses
[who’d stood in brood in the yard
questioning their creator],
she began to pluck them, with all
the agility of a gray-lined hawk.
like the caress of the jaguar’s skull
on the capybara’s, or the annulate
embrace of the caracara’s claws
on a snake’s all-torso body,
nothing in that old woman
was cognized
beyond a simple mission:
to feed her offspring.
as any animal does not question
the food chain in the face of hunger,
my grandmother was of all animals
the most innocent in my house
and in my forest.
more than cats and pigeons,
more than tortoises and rabbits,
this is far more certain:
my grandmother was more innocent
even than our household dogs,
our big, fat dogs
with sharp — but useless — teeth,
also waiting for that age-old mammal
to drench her hands in blood.",pt_XX,en_XX,"ancestral slaughter

in my house and my jungle.

quem quer que lhe tivesse concebido os ossos, era então visível o objectivo de os fazer florir. deles brotaria a pele, o céu, a encenação da glória. tudo isso mais não eram, entretanto, do que imagens em apuros, imagens atacadas por memórias em conflito com o presente, ou mesmo com o passado onde pareciam radicar, e que, esbeiçando-se nos bordos, davam lugar a que o esquecimento sobre elas actuasse como uma espécie de ácido sulfúrico.
de cada vez que o invadia, a enxurrada da memória ascendia-lhe assim a um tal nível da consciência que os seus próprios ossos, deixando de ser pontos fixos e estáveis aos quais ele se pudesse segurar, vinham, desmantelados, boiar à superfície das águas borrascosas, de mistura

"sete anos de pastor jacob servia
labão, pai de raquel, serrana bela;
mas não servia ao pai, servia a ela,
e a ela só por prémio pretendia.
os dias, na esperança de um só dia,
passava, contentando-se com vê-la;
porém o pai, usando de cautela
em lugar de raquel lhe dava lia.
vendo o triste pastor que com enganos
lhe fora assi negada a sua pastora,
como se a não tivera merecida;
começa de servir outros sete anos,
dizendo: — mais servira, se não fora
para tão longo amor tão curta a vida.","jacob
for seven years, the shepherd jacob slaved
for the father of beautiful rachel, working not for the man,
but only for her, knowing ever since he began
that she alone was the only reward he craved.
his days, dreaming of the wedding that lay ahead,
passed by, content to see her from time to time,
until her father plotted his duplicitous crime,
by placing leah in jacob’s marriage bed.
learning the cruel deception, jacob, in tears,
had lost the one he loved, as if, somehow,
he hadn’t truly earned the proper wife.
but he starts all over again, for seven more years,
saying, “if life wasn’t so short, beginning right now,
i\'d serve even longer for rachel, the love of my life.”",pt_XX,en_XX,"Seven years as a shepherd Jacob served
Laban, father of Rachel, the fair mountain girl;
But he didn't serve the father, he served her,
And only to her did he aim for reward.
The days, in hope of just one day,
He spent, contenting himself with seeing her;
But the father, using caution,
Instead of Rachel, gave him Leah.
Seeing the sad shepherd that with deceit
His shepherdess had been denied to him,
As if he hadn't deserved her;
He begins to serve another seven years,
Saying: - I would have served more, if it weren't
For such a short life for such a long love.",5
"abdicação
toma-me, ó noite eterna, nos teus braços
e chama-me teu filho. eu sou um rei
que voluntariamente abandonei
o meu trono de sonhos e cansaços.
minha espada, pesada a braços lassos,
em mãos viris e calmas entreguei,
e meu ceptro e coroa — eu os deixei
na antecâmara, feitos em pedaços.
minha cota de malha, tão inútil,
minhas esporas, de um tinir tão fútil,
deixei-as pela fria escadaria.
despi a realeza, corpo e alma,
e regressei à noite antiga e calma
como a paisagem ao morrer do dia.","abdication

and take me into your arms. i’m a king
who relinquished, willingly,
my throne of dreams and tedium.

i surrendered to strong and steady hands,
and in the anteroom i abandoned
my shattered scepter and crown.
my spurs that jingled to no avail
and my useless coat of mail
i left on the cold stone steps.
i took off royalty, body and soul,
and returned to the night so calm, so old,

"retrato de uma princesa desconhecida
para que ela tivesse um pescoço tão fino
para que os seus pulsos tivessem um quebrar de caule
para que os seus olhos fossem tão frontais e limpos

de corpo dobrado e grossas mãos pacientes
