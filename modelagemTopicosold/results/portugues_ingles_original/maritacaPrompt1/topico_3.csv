"a viagem de alexandre à índia
andaste de um ao outro lado da terra na vida interminável,
tiveste degredos, piedosos cíumes, a fé desvanescida,
amantes paradas na lavoura, roubando-te o rosto amado.
viste vestígios de que foste a sombra de ninguém,
olhos sem pudor, do reflexo dos ferros no tropel,
franjas do domínio pueril de alexandre, olhando gaugamela.
partiste num porto de transição para o levante,
com vazios para trás, todo o tempo a poder ver,
e ao primeiro inverno, pelos cardeais das suas cinzas,
começaste a travessia que não termina, a história que não acaba.
soubeste porque se vislumbra, em lágrimas, o pinheiro da juventude,
o nome quebrado num turvo ar medido sem corda,
e a maresia do vento de feição no segundo inverno.
em troca perseguiste o que rege o homem fortuito,
segredando em palácios de mármore que são apenas pedras,
dos fracassos a que jamais alguém ajoelhara.
ao terceiro inverno descobriste o hemisfério, e ao quarto,
sem ideia de guerra ou ordem para mudar o reino,
escolheste adornar os aquedutos sob o manto dos regatos,
sentado, na brisa no tanque, ao febril entardecer.
de quem te aproximaste, no seu trajecto interminado,
sem lugar senão o que esfria na mente recortada,
naquilo que se ramifica, tornando-se na própria teia,
contigo propagou o dever de passar em toda a parte.
e quando veio o quinto inverno, e o sexto, suturaste o sangue,
trouxeste a pele à curva dos rios, acolheste o que de resto se desmorona,
e pudeste enfim, na crença dos migradores furtivos, entender que
tudo se perde noutro lugar ainda, e após esse ainda noutro
e que ao fim de cada manhã noutra manhã
tudo é incerto, tão conforme o dente-de-leão no meio de searas,
tão emudecido como a veia exausta dos não sepultados.
na mansarda onde vagueia o dia e a noite
o vento responde, cortando o centeio e o calcário, e a vela
que brilha na luz de estrelas veladas, já desaparecidas,
pisadas, mudas, engolidas aos pés do sétimo inverno,
arpoa o coração e a ruína — os meridianos despem-se, voam
em vinte e cinco anos que há pouco se beijavam, e seja dito ou não dito
o prazer que inflige um pico de tormentos
por lábios que só as mulheres conhecem
no moinho das águas da morte em varanasi,
sacode a chama de quanto vale, dura e canta
o princípio e o fim do teu poder na terra.","alexandres`s travel to india
you wandered an interminable life across the earth,
suffered exile, piteous jealousy, futile faith,
labour-arrested lovers plundering your beloved’s face.
you saw traces of having been no one’s shadow,
impudent eyes, the reflection of iron on the rampage,
hints of alexander’s puerile dominance, contemplating gaugamela.
you set off from a transient port towards the levant,
leaving emptiness behind, seeing all of time,
and in the first winter, by the cardinals of its ashes,
you started the endless crossing, the incessant history.
you knew, because the pine tree of youth can be glimpsed through tears,
of the shattered name in a cloudy mood measured without ropes,
and of the favourable sea breeze in the second winter.
in exchange you pursued that which rules the fortuitous man,
whispering in marble palaces that are but stones,
failures to which no one had ever knelt.
by the third winter you discovered the hemisphere, and by the fourth,
non intent on war or order to change the kingdom,
you chose to adorn aqueducts with the mantle of streams,
sitting by the pool breeze, in the evening´s lingering fever.
whomever you approached, in their indefinite path,
without a place except that which fades inside a patchy mind,
in that which branches out and becomes the very web,
has spread with you the duty to pass through everywhere.
and by the fifth winter, and the sixth, you stitched up the blood,
brought the skin on to the river bends, welcomed that which falls apart,
and were at last capable, with the belief of a stealthy migrant, of understanding
that all is lost yet in another place, and after this in yet another
and that by the end of each morning in another morning
all is uncertain, just like a dandelion in a field of wheat,
as muted as the exhausted vein of the unburied.
in the attic where night and day roam
the wind replies, cutting the chalk and the rye, and the candle,
shimmering in the light of the veiled stars already gone,
trodden, voiceless, swallowed up by the seventh winter,
spears the heart and the ruin — the meridians undress, fly away
in twenty five years that were just kissing yesterday, and be it told or untold
the pleasure that brings a peak of torment, inflicted
by lips that only women know
in the turmoil of varanasi´s death waters,
tests the flame of the merit, endurance and song of
the beginning and the end of your power on earth.",pt_XX,en_XX,"The journey of alexander to india
you've traveled from one end of the earth to the other in endless life,
you've had banishments, pious jealousies, faith that faded away,
lovers standing still in the fields, stealing your beloved's face.
you've seen traces that you were the shadow of no one,
eyes without shame, the reflection of the iron in the rush,
fringes of the petty realm of alexander, watching gaugamela.
you left from a transitional port towards the east,
with emptiness behind, all the time to look back,
and by the first winter, by the cardinal points of its ashes,
you began the crossing that never ends, the story that doesn't end.
you knew why the pine of youth is glimpsed in tears,
the name broken in a murky air measured without a string,
and the brine of the wind in its mood in the second winter.
in exchange you pursued what governs the casual man,
whispering in marble palaces that are merely stones,
of the failures to which no one had ever kneeled.
by the third winter you discovered the hemisphere, and by the fourth,
without an idea of war or order to change the realm,
you chose to adorn the aqueducts under the mantle of brooks,
sitting in the breeze by the tank, at feverish dusk.
with whom you drew close, in their endless path,
without a place but what chills the cut mind,
in what branches out, becoming the web itself,
with you the duty to pass everywhere was propagated.
and when the fifth and sixth winters came, you staunched the blood,
you brought the skin to the curve of the rivers, embraced what else collapses,
and you could finally, in the belief of the stealthy migrants, understand that
everything is lost somewhere else, and after that somewhere else again
and that at the end of each morning there is another morning,
everything is uncertain, as the dandelion in the midst of fields,
as silent as the vein exhausted of the unburied.
in the attic where day and night wander
the wind responds, cutting the rye and limestone, and the sail
that shines in the light of veiled stars, already gone,
trampled, mute, swallowed at the feet of the seventh winter,
spears the heart and the ruin — the meridians strip off, fly
in twenty-five years that recently kissed each other, and whether said or unsaid
the pleasure that inflicts a peak of torment
by lips that only women know
in the mill of the death waters in varanasi,
it shakes the flame of its worth, hardens and sings
the beginning and the end of your power on earth.",3

"a europa em roterdão
dói-me o coração da europa, com as suas veias inchadas
pelo vento do ocidente, e as mãos gretadas pelo gelo
dos invernos. sentei-me com a europa num bar de roterdão,
desenhando na cabeça os mapas do mundo; e obriguei-a
a beber o café holandês, com os seus lábios doentes,
como se a europa não fosse o continente insone
dos últimos milénios, varrido pelos temporais da
mitologia, de crença abalada por um terror ateu.
vi a europa nesse café de roterdão, antes de sair
para as ruas desenhadas a compasso e esquadro;
perguntei-lhe para onde queria ir; e ouvi o seu
murmúrio despir-se de uma palidez plural, como
se ela quisesse ser o rosto único da multidão,
e passear num anonimato de rua cosmopolita,
ouvindo as vozes que lhe falam de ilhas e praias,
restituindo-lhe um sonho de antigas viagens.
vejo nos seus olhos um reflexo das gruas e
guindastes do porto de roterdão, e apago-o com
a borracha da eternidade, para que ela se sente
na esplanada onde lhe peço que me fale; e
ela olha-me, em silêncio, com a voz alucinada
num eco de loucura; e ouço-a dizer-me que
não sabe em que tempo vive, como se fosse
eu que lhe tivesse de ensinar o caminho.
pego na sua mão; e ela desfaz-se nas linhas
improváveis do poema, onde se projecta uma
sombra que eu perco, na noite de roterdão.","europe in rotterdam
the heart of europe is hurting me, with its veins swollen
by the wind out of the west, and its hands cracked by the ice
of winters. i sat down with europe in a rotterdam bar,
drawing the maps of the world in my mind; i made her
drink a dutch coffee, with her sick lips,
as though europe were not the insomniac continent
of the latest millennia, swept by the storms of
mythology, belief shaken by an atheist terror.
i saw europe in that café in rotterdam, before going out
into the streets drawn by compass and set square;
i asked her where she would like to go; and heard her
murmur slip out of her plural paleness, as though
she’d wanted to be the crowd’s single face,
and walk anonymously down the cosmopolitan street,
hearing the voices which speak of to her of islands and beaches,
that restore her dream of ancient voyages.
in her eyes i see a reflection of the cranes and
winches of rotterdam port, and i rub it out
with eternity’s eraser, so that she’ll sit
on the esplanade where i ask her to talk to me; and
she looks at me, in silence, with her voice crazed
by an echo of madness; and i listen to her tell me that
she doesn’t know what period she lives in, as though
it had to be me that had shown her the path.

colorido e o cinto azul que eu trazia sempre largo

as escadas de madeira rangentes
ao compasso dos passos, sentidas ainda
à distância de vinte anos,
todas nós em submissa fila a responder à chamada,
""presente"" parecia-me então lógico e certo
como assistir à oração na capela e ler as epístolas
(de são paulo aos coríntios:

tem uma voz bonita e lê tão bem, e depois
mandavam-me apertar o cinto para ficar
mais composta em cima do banquinho,
à direita do padre
e o fascínio das confissões,
as vozes sussuradas na fina madeira
castanha a esconder uma falta,
o cheiro do chão encerrado e da cera das velas
e quando deixei de acreditar em pecados
e comecei a achar que as palavras não prestam
e que era inútil
inútil a teia de madeira

over the sea, looking up ‘gulls’ in the dictionary
corrections in red and the passé simple,
writing nous fûmes vous fûtes ils fûrent a hundred times

like a drill sergeant her face turning angry
and red (i have too many globules! faites attention)

pooling beneath the desks,

and the algebraic equations
with x as unknown

to be good, and neither the little saint nor candy,
but the sweet word fondling me from within,
our white smocks spotted with bright hued gouache
the blue belt i always wore draped
like a swashbuckler
creaking wooden stairs
rhyming to steps
twenty years on,
falling into formation to the roll,
“present” seemed so logical and certain then,
like going to prayers in the chapel and reading the epistles
(saint paul to the corinthians:
in that time…),
you have such a beautiful voice and read so well,
and then they made me tighten my belt,
primped in my pew
to the right of the priest

voices murmuring through the fine wooden web
dissembling defects,
smell of the waxed floor and the wax of the candles
and when i stopped believing in sin,
knew words didn’t do any good,
that the wooden web

oh, old notebook
where I wrote my French compositions
my vacation: I enjoyed the holidays very much
je suis allée à la plage (with two 'e's,
the 'être' verb requires concordance), j'ai beaucoup
nagé and then it would end with the sun setting
over the sea and I would look up seagulls in the dictionary
the corrections in red and the passé simple,
writing a hundred times nous fûmes vous fûtes ils fûrent
the sunny afternoons
and madame denise who said toi ma petite
with a sergeant's look and her angry face turning red
(there are too many red blood cells in me, faites attention)
and the look that contradicted everything
in tenderness remplit
and the rules memorized and the verbal endings
ais, ais, ait,
the extra study hour and the late afternoon sun
seeping through the desks,
the nun distractedly watching in psalms
me daydreaming with the book open
once upon a time there was a little boy
and the third degree equations with one
unknown
ah, clear afternoons when it was good
to be good, neither the saintly nor the lollipop
but the sweet word caressing me inside,
the all white aprons splashed with colorful gouache
and the wide blue sash that swung loose
like a swordswoman's
the creaky wooden stairs
to the rhythm of footsteps, felt even now
at the distance of twenty years,
all of us in submissive line to answer the roll call,
""present"" seemed logical and right then
like attending prayer in the chapel and reading the epistles
(of paul to the corinthians:
in those days...),
he has a beautiful voice and reads so well, and then
they made me tighten my sash to sit more
composed on the stool,
at the right of the priest
and the fascination of confessions,
whispered voices in the fine brown wood
hiding a lack,
the smell of the closed floor and the candle wax
and when I stopped believing in sins
and started thinking words were useless
and that it was pointless
pointless the wooden lattice

"a neve e o amor
neste dia de calor ardente, estou esperando a neve.
sempre estive à sua espera.
quando menino, li recordações da casa dos mortos
e vi a neve caindo na estepe siberiana
e no casaco roto de fédor dostoievski.
amo a neve porque ela não separa o dia da noite
nem afasta o céu das aflições da terra.
une o que está separado:
os passos dos homens condenados ao gelo escurecido
e os suspiros de amor que se perdem no ar.
é necessário ter um ouvido muito afiado
para ouvir a música da neve caindo, algo quase silencioso
como o roçar da asa de um anjo, caso os anjos existissem,
ou o estertor de um pássaro.
não se deve esperar a neve como se espera o amor.
são coisas diferentes. basta abrirmos os olhos para ver a neve
cair no campo desolado. e ela cai em nós, a neve branca e fria
que não queima como o fogo do amor.
para ver o amor os nossos olhos não bastam,
nem os ouvidos, nem a boca, nem mesmo os nossos corações
que batem na escuridão com o mesmo rumor
da neve caindo nas estepes
e nos telhados das cabanas escuras
e no casaco roto de fédor dostoievski.
para ver o amor, nada basta. e tanto o frio do inverno como o calor escaldante
o afastam de nós, de nossos braços abertos
e de nossos corações atormentados.
fiel à minha infância, prefiro ver a neve
que une o céu e a terra, a noite e o dia,
a ser a presa indefesa do amor,
o amor que não é branco nem puro nem frio como a neve.","snow and love

i’ve been waiting for it always.

i love snow because it doesn’t separate day from night
or distance heaven from the sufferings of earth.
it unites what’s separate:
the footsteps of those condemned to darkened ice
and sighs of love vanishing in the air.
one has to have a fine-tuned ear
to hear the music of falling snow, something almost silent
like the touch of an angel’s wing, assuming there are angels,
or the dying breath of a bird.
one shouldn’t wait for snow the way one waits for love.
they are different things. it’s enough to open our eyes to see the snow
falling on a deserted field. and it falls on us, cold white snow
that doesn’t burn like the flame of love.
to see love our eyes do not suffice,
nor our ears, nor our mouth, nor even our hearts
that beat in the dark with the same sound
as snow falling on the steppes

to see love, nothing suffices. both winter cold and searing heat
keep it from us, from our open arms
and our tormented hearts.

aproveitando a sombra débil e ambulante.
sentado na boleia, as rédeas na mão morena
descuidadas, um homem cisma, confia
do caminho ao macho lento a decisão.
outros homens a pé e mulheres novas
entretêm de riso a caminhada espessa.
logo após, sobre os burros, os pertences.

de alguma enfermidade menos limpa
e neles cravam dentes de fome milenária.
dizem que as mulheres estão na intimidade
das estrelas e a troco de uns mil-réis
lêem nas mãos destinos coloridos.
dizem que roubam quintais e assaltam capoeiras,
e os aldeões, em pânico secreto,
os expulsam com voz impiedosa e decidida mão
das cercanias do seu chão governado.

em negócios sempre escuros de animais,
em que fazem passar por uma estampa

têm por costume, depois de embriagados,
trocar com as bengalas possantes e vistosas
pancadaria rija, de que morrem.

dizem que não têm deus e que se casam

solitário trepador pela encosta de avintes. não

e mesmo foram mais apátridas sofrendo de uma pátria que não haja.

requebro de meia-tijela, nostalgia dos analfabetos,
e outras coisas medíocres e mesquinhas da vulgaridade, como ele não. ou de ser
prato de não-resistência para os concertistas que tocam para as pessoas que julgam
que gostam de música mas não gostam. ainda por cima
era um arrivista, um pedante convencido da aristocracia que não tinha,
um reaccionário ansiando por revoluções que libertassem as oligarquias
da polónia, coitadinhas, e outras. e, para cúmulo,
a gente começa a desconfiar de que não era sequer um romântico,
pelo menos da maneira que ele fingiu ser e deixou entender que era.
uma arte de compor a música como quem escreve um poema,
a força que se disfarça em languidez, um ar de inspiração
ocultando a estrutura, uma melancolia harmónica por sobre
a ironia melódica (ou o contrário), a magia dos ritmos
usada para esconder o pensamento – e escondê-lo tanto,
que ainda passa por burro de génio este homem que tinha o pensamento nos dedos,
e cuja audácia usava a máscara do sentimento ou das formas livres
para criar-se a si mesmo. tão hábil na sua cozinha, que pode servir-se
morno, às horas da saudade e da amargura,
quente, nas grandes ocasiões da vida triunfal,
e frio, quando só a música dirá o desespero vácuo
de ser-se piano e nada mais no mundo.","chopin: an inventory

two dozen preludes; a score of nocturnes;

one berceuse, one barcalole, one fantasy, one tarantella, etc.,

a talent for concertizing; many mundane successes; an unhappy passion;
a celebrated liaison with a famous woman; other assorted liaisons;
a country without sure borders or definite independence;
the french europe of romanticism; several friendships with the eminent;
and scarcely thirty-nine years of life. others lived less, wrote more,
tasted more bitterly the classically bitter bread of exile, were ignored
or persecuted, died forsaken, didn’t linger in alcoves
or salons of glory, confined themselves less to the instrument they had mastered most,
and were exiled longer in suffering for a non-existent country.
besides, almost all the others escaped the repugnant possibility
of becoming a melody for virgins, a rhythm for the castrated,
a sham, a languishing, a nostalgia of illiterates,
and other vulgar, mediocre, and ungenerous things – as he did not. or of becoming
a piece de non-résistance for performers who play for those who believe
they like music but really don’t. and what’s more,
he was a parvenu, a pedant sure of an aristocracy he couldn’t claim,
a reactionary anguished over revolutions that would liberate, among others,
the oligarchies of poland – poor things. and, finally,
one begins to suspect he was not even a romantic,
at least not in the sense he pretended or let others believe he was.
a knack for composing music as one writes a poem,
a power disguising itself in languor, an air of inspiration
concealing the structure, a harmonious melancholy above

treachery and death, or it must renounce in the face of the most

the shore, we know security is your preferred dream.

of all you desired and lose, without appeal,

borne by the wind, under the eaves of the roofs?
nothing will you be able to carry, in a last spasm.
you yourself will be captured, in the momentous afternoon,
when it was your desire and you lose without appeal
under the law of the common people or any order
praetorian, sentenced to a biblical motive
and the resignation of a Roman existence.
today you have only the imitation of your face
in the mirror. and nothing else you must defend
when the works of god rise up
(beyond the gaze, see, you still have the entire world...).",3
"oh as casas as casas as casas
oh as casas as casas as casas
as casas nascem vivem e morrem
enquanto vivas distinguem-se umas das outras
distinguem-se designadamente pelo cheiro
variam até de sala pra sala
as casas que eu fazia em pequeno
onde estarei eu hoje em pequeno?
onde estarei aliás eu dos versos daqui a pouco?
terei eu casa onde reter tudo isto
ou serei sempre somente esta instabilidade?
as casas essas parecem estáveis
mas são tão frágeis as pobres casas
oh as casas as casas as casas
mudas testemunhas da vida
elas morrem não só ao ser demolidas
elas morrem com a morte das pessoas
as casas de fora olham-nos pelas janelas
não sabem nada de casas os construtores
os senhorios os procuradores
os ricos vivem nos seus palácios
mas a casa dos pobres é todo o mundo
os pobres sim têm o conhecimento das casas
os pobres esses conhecem tudo
eu amei as casas os recantos das casas
visitei casas apalpei casas
só as casas explicam que exista
uma palavra como intimidade
sem casas não haveria ruas
as ruas onde passamos pelos outros
mas passamos principalmente por nós
na casa nasci e hei-de morrer
na casa sofri convivi amei
na casa atravessei as estações
respirei – ó vida simples problema de respiração
oh as casas as casas as casas","oh houses houses houses
oh houses houses houses
houses are born and live and die
while alive they stand out from each other
they stand out namely by their smell
they differ even from room to room
ah the houses i built in my childhood
where might i be today in my childhood?
where might i be in a little while from these verses?
will i have a house to store all of this in
or will i always be just this instability?
unlike me houses seem stable
but they’re so fragile poor houses
oh houses houses houses
silent witnesses of life
they die not only when demolished
they die with the death of people
houses look at us through their windows
builders landlords and real estate agents
know nothing about houses
rich people have their palaces
but the house of the poor is the whole world
it’s the poor who know about houses
the poor know everything
i loved houses their nooks and corners
i visited houses i fondled houses
only houses can explain
why a word like intimacy exists
without houses there would be no streets
the streets where we cross paths with others
and especially with ourselves
in a house i was born and i’ll die
in a house i suffered i lived with others i loved
in a house i went through the seasons
i breathed – o life simple problem of respiration
oh houses houses houses",pt_XX,en_XX,"oh the houses the houses the houses

"you are welcome to elsinore
entre nós e as palavras há metal fundente
entre nós e as palavras há hélices que andam
e podem dar-nos morte violar-nos tirar
do mais fundo de nós o mais útil segredo
entre nós e as palavras há perfis ardentes
espaços cheios de gente de costas
altas flores venenosas portas por abrir
e escadas e ponteiros e crianças sentadas
à espera do seu tempo e do seu precipício
ao longo da muralha que habitamos
há palavras de vida há palavras de morte
há palavras imensas, que esperam por nós
e outras, frágeis, que deixaram de esperar
há palavras acesas como barcos
e há palavras homens, palavras que guardam
o seu segredo e a sua posição
entre nós e as palavras, surdamente,
as mãos e as paredes de elsinore
e há palavras nocturnas palavras gemidos
palavras que nos sobem ilegíveis à boca
palavras diamantes palavras nunca escritas
palavras impossíveis de escrever
por não termos connosco cordas de violinos
nem todo o sangue do mundo nem todo o amplexo do ar
e os braços dos amantes escrevem muito alto
muito além do azul onde oxidados morrem
palavras maternais só sombra só soluço
só espasmos só amor só solidão desfeita
entre nós e as palavras, os emparedados
e entre nós e as palavras, o nosso dever falar","you are welcome to elsinore
between us and words there’s molten metal
between us and words there are spinning propellers
that can kill us ravish us wrench
from our inner depths the most worthwhile secret
between us and words there are burning profiles
spaces full of people with their backs turned
tall poisonous flowers closed doors
and stairs and ticking clocks and seated children
waiting for their time and their precipice
along the walls in which we live
there are words of life words of death
there are vast words that wait for us
and other, fragile words that have stopped waiting
there are words lit up like boats
and there are words that are men, words that conceal
their secret and their position
between us and words, without a sound,
the hands and walls of elsinore
and there are words of night words that are moans
illegible words that rise to our lips
diamond words unwritten words
words that can’t be written
because here we don’t have any violin strings
we don’t have all the world’s blood or the air’s whole embrace
and the arms of lovers write high overhead
far beyond the blue where they rust and die
maternal words just shadow just sobbing
just spasms just love just solitude’s dissolution
between us and words those who are walled in,
and between us and words our duty to speak",pt_XX,en_XX,"You are welcome to Elsinore
Between us and the words there's molten metal
Between us and the words there are gears that move
And can give us death, violate us, extort
The most useful secret from the depths of us
Between us and the words there are burning profiles
Spaces filled with people with their backs turned
High poisonous flowers doors to open
And stairs and pointers and children sitting
Waiting for their time and their precipice
Along the wall that we inhabit
There are words of life and words of death
There are immense words, waiting for us
And others, fragile, that have stopped waiting
There are lit words like boats
And there are word-men, words that hold
Their secret and their stance
Between us and the words, silently,
The hands and the walls of Elsinore
And there are nocturnal words words moans
Words that rise unreadable to our mouths
Words diamonds words never written
Words impossible to write
For we don't have with us violin strings
Nor all the blood of the world nor all the embrace of the air
And the arms of lovers write very high
Very far beyond the blue where rusted they die
Maternal words just shadow just wail
Just spasms just love just solitude undone
Between us and the words, the trapped
And between us and the words, our duty to speak",3
