“eu cá também não gosto, há mais coisas
além deste desconchavo”, dizia marianne
moore da poesia. de resto, conseguia
ver mitocôndrias e as demais
pequenas vidas – olho fixo
na miúda mancha de aguarela
comprimida entre vidros de lamela
redonda a pupila em maravilha
prévia ao mistério: saber o que era.
mais importa observar ou designar?
eu erro no olhar receio às vezes
esqueço a árvore onde deixei as chaves
e o caderno, depois não sei chamar
o quê, espécie ou parentesco, ache embora
sossego na língua arcana dos plátanos
atrás das placas do jardim botânico.
portanto sirvo mal, sou outra, fora
do baralho, turista aqui em tanto
do que me dá prazer e algum trabalho.
mas não está dito ainda (ou está) se insisto
à minha pouca escala nisto eu
é porque não desligo e toco e falho

‘i, too, dislike it: there are things that are important
beyond all this fiddle,’ marianne moore said about
poetry. in any case, she was able
to see mitochondria and all the other
tiny lives – eye fixed
on the minute blotch of watercolor
compressed between two glass slides
the pupil round with wonder
just before mystery: to know what it was.
is it more important to observe or to designate?
i fear sometimes i look askew
forget the tree where i left my keys
and my notebook, then i don’t know what to call
what, kind or relation, though i find
tranquility in the arcane language of the plane trees
behind the plaques in the botanical garden.
so i serve badly, i’m other, the odd one
out, a tourist here in so much
that pleases me and is work.
but it’s still not said (or is) if i insist
on my small scale in this myself

“I don’t like it either, there are more things

moore of poetry. besides, I could
see mitochondria and other
small lives – I stare fixedly

does it matter more to observe or to name?

I forget the tree where I left my keys

peace in the arcane language of the plane trees

"texto de apresentação
1.
é-me indiferente: poeta, poetisa
dependerá do ritmo ou da medida –
prefiro tradutora, mas admito
que por vezes não dobro e sou narcisa.
2.
a minha primeira poesia era
sobre chuva e choro. hoje seria
prosa, ou sobre chuva e a pólvora:
chove fora viola o vento o vidro,
a rua nunca é como os prospectos –
o meu bilhete ao mundo, espeto-o
com delicado verbo ao coração.
rebenta, murcho músculo entupido –
mil vezes fosse a vida a excepção.
3.
se o rigor do verso não visa qualquer prova
senão procura –
ou provar o que seja de sabor.
se não escrevo por encomenda
senão por ventura serôdia
4.
posso posar, certamente,
para a máquina fotográfica,
moldar a boca ao disparo ou regular
a abertura ao diafragma. dependente
do papel revelador –
modelo artista presa, sou como todos:
as vidas que não toco interessam-me
num desequilíbrio de voracidade e avareza.

1.
for me it makes little difference: poet, poetess –
depends on the measure, and the stress –
i prefer translator, but admit
that i sometimes can’t be plied, i’m a narcissist.
2.
my earliest poetry was about rain
and weeping. today it would be
prose and rain, or gunpowder:
it's raining out, wind rapes the window,
a street is never like the brochures –
with fine eloquence i stab my note
to the world through my heart.
it bursts, withered muscle bloat –
a thousand times that life were more than art.
3.
if the line’s strict measure doesn’t aim to show
but is a seeking instead –
or is the taste of what it finds . . .
if i don’t write to order,
but showered by latter rain.
4.
certainly, i can pose
for the camera,
mold my mouth to the click, close
down the diaphragm. it depends
how the roll is developed –
model artist prey, i’m like everyone:
the lives i don’t touch interest me
in uneven parts of avarice and voracity.
before they know me, period,
they know me periodically.",pt_XX,en_XX,"introductory text

plágio manhoso do big-bang

mas a região mais central do nada, o pátio
furioso da potência
e neste lugar de substâncias, de objectos
as palavras são figuras do imundo, coisas que
sobraram do estampido inaugural desse dia inicial inteiro
e limpo que culminou no lugar a menos deste texto
breve logaritmo sem aplicação ou saída

de afirmar o que propende para o infindo

e dá pelo nome de imprevisto, ou acidente

para falarmos do meio de obter o poema,
a retórica não serve. trata-se de uma coisa simples, que não
precisa de requintes nem de fórmulas. apanha-se

no meio do campo, nem das que se vendem nas lojas
ou nos mercados. é uma flor de sílabas, em que as
pétalas são as vogais, e o caule uma consoante. põe-se
no jarro da estrofe, e deixa-se estar. para que não morra,
basta um pedaço de primavera na água, que se vai
buscar à imaginação, quando está um dia de chuva,
ou se faz entrar pela janela, quando o ar fresco
da manhã enche o quarto de azul. então,
a flor confunde-se com o poema, mas ainda não é
o poema. para que ele nasça, a flor precisa
de encontrar cores mais naturais do que essas
que a natureza lhe deu. podem ser as cores do teu
rosto – a sua brancura, quando o sol vem ter contigo,
ou o fundo dos teus olhos em que todas as cores
da vida se confundem, com o brilho da vida. depois,
deito essas cores sobre a corola, e vejo-as descerem
para as folhas, como a seiva que corre pelos
veios invisíveis da alma. posso, então, colher a flor,
e o que tenho na mão é este poema que
me deste.","how to make a poem
if we’re going to talk about how to make a poem,
rhetoric has nothing to do with it. it’s simpler than that, and doesn’t
require subtleties or formulas. pick
a flower, for example, but not one of those flowers that grow
in the middle of fields, nor the ones they sell in stores,
or in the markets. a flower of syllables rather, in which the
petals are vowels, and the stem is the consonant. place it
in the vase of the stanza, and let it be. so that it doesn’t die,
it’s enough to put a little spring in the water, which,
on a rainy day, is fetched from the imagination,
or is pushed in through the window when the cool air
of morning fills the blue room. this is when
the flower begins to seem like a poem, but it’s still not
the poem. for it to really sprout, the flower needs
to find more natural colors than those
which nature gave it. they might be the colors
of your complexion – its whiteness, when the sun falls on you,
or the depths of your eyes in which all the colors

to talk about the means of obtaining a poem,
rhetoric is useless. it is a simple thing, which does not need refinements or formulas.
you pick a flower, for example, but it should not be one of those flowers that grow
in the middle of the field, nor the ones sold in shops
or markets. it is a flower of syllables, in which the
petals are the vowels, and the stem a consonant.
you put it in the vase of the stanza, and let it be.
so that it does not die,
all that is needed is a piece of spring in the water, which you
get from your imagination, when it is a rainy day,
or let it enter through the window, when the fresh
morning air fills the room with blue. then,
the flower becomes one with the poem, but it is not yet
the poem. for it to be born, the flower needs to
find more natural colors than those that nature gave it. they may be the colors of your face – its whiteness, when the sun comes to you, or the depths of your eyes where all the colors of life blend together, with the brightness of life. then, I pour these colors over the corolla, and I see them descend into the leaves, like the sap that runs through the invisible veins of the soul. I can then pick the flower, and what I have in my hand is this poem that you gave me.",1.0

and you had no stain other than that of a strange name
then those that as you grew up you painfully wore
the truth of bread the truth of tears
for you are neither flower nor mourning nor lullaby nor star
then those that you won with your semen
where the morning holds up an empty mirror
and a child cries among clouds and abysses
then those that they will place on top of your portrait
when you give them the great memory
that everyone expects so much because they expect it from you
nothing after that, only you and your silence
and veins of coral tearing our wrists
then, my lord, we will be able to pass
across the naked plain
your body with clouds on its shoulders
my hands full of beards white
there will be no delay, no shelter, no arrival
but a square of fire above our heads
and a stone road until the end of the lights
and a deathly silence as we pass",1.0

«transforma-se o amador na coisa amada», com seu
feroz sorriso, os dentes,
as mãos que relampejam no escuro. traz ruído
e silêncio. traz o barulho das ondas frias
e das ardentes pedras que tem dentro de si.
e cobre esse ruído rudimentar com o assombrado
silêncio da sua última vida.
o amador transforma-se de instante para instante,
e sente-se o espírito imortal do amor
criando a carne em extremas atmosferas, acima
de todas as coisas mortas.
transforma-se o amador. corre pelas formas dentro.
e a coisa amada é uma baía estanque.
é o espaço de um castiçal,
a coluna vertebral e o espírito
das mulheres sentadas.
transforma-se em noite extintora.
porque o amador é tudo, e a coisa amada
é uma cortina
onde o vento do amador bate no alto da janela
aberta. o amador entra
por todas as janelas abertas. ele bate, bate, bate.
o amador é um martelo que esmaga.
que transforma a coisa amada.
ele entra pelos ouvidos, e depois a mulher
que escuta
fica com aquele grito para sempre na cabeça
a arder como o primeiro dia do verão. ela ouve
e vai-se transformando, enquanto dorme, naquele grito
do amador.
depois acorda, e vai, e dá-se ao amador,
dá-lhe o grito dele.
e o amador e a coisa amada são um único grito
anterior de amor.
e gritam e batem. ele bate-lhe com o seu espírito
de amador. e ela é batida, e bate-lhe
com o seu espírito de amada.
então o mundo transforma-se neste ruído áspero
do amor. enquanto em cima
o silêncio do amador e da amada alimentam
o imprevisto silêncio do mundo e do amor.","the lover transforms

savage smile, his teeth,

silence of his last life.
