"a necessidade
uma porta fechada não é suficiente para que o homem
esconda o seu amor. ele também necessita de uma porta aberta

um telhado não basta para que o homem se proteja
do calor e da tempestade. para fugir ao relâmpago

o homem precisa de tudo: do amor e do raio.","necessities

from heat and storm. to flee the thunderbolt

if, at the end of such a long and short life,
my living ray were still ignited by you,
I would consider everything I go through to be good.
But I know well that first the extreme step
will come to close my sad eyes
that those for which I live show me love.
The ink and pen will be witnesses,
which have written of such a troublesome life
the least that I have gone through, and the most that I speak.
Oh! I do not know what I write, nor what I speak!
that if I give a thought to another step,
I see such a sad kind of life
that, if so many eyes were not worth it,
I cannot imagine what sorrow would be
that carries this sorrow with which I live.
In my soul I have a living fire,
that, if it did not breathe in what I speak,
the sorrow would already be turned to ashes;
but, over the greatest pain that I suffer and go through,
the tears in my eyes
temper me,
with which, fleeing, life does not end.
I am dying in life,
and I live in death;
I see without eyes,
and I speak without tongue;
and I pass together
glory and sorrow.",2.0

every large hope is a grand illusion.
i chase some good that can’t be had:
