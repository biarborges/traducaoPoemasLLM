"da menina e moça
pensando-vos estou filha
vossa mãe me está lembrando
enchem-se-me os olhos d’água
nela vos estou lavando:
nascestes filha antre mágoa
para bem filha vos seja
que no vosso nascimento
vos ouve a fortuna inveja:
morto era o contentamento
nenhuma alegria ouvistes,
vossa mãe era finada,
nos outras éamos tristes:
nada em dor em dor crescida
não sei onde isto há de ir ter
vejo-vos filha fermosa
cos olhos verdes crescer:
não era esta graça vossa
para nascer em desterro
mal haja a desaventura
que pôs mais nisto que o erro:
tinha aqui sua sepultura
vossa mãe e mágoa a nós
não éreis vos filha não
para morrerem por vós:
não houve em fados razão
nem se consente rogar
de vosso pai hei mor dó
que de si s’á de queixar:
eu vos ouvi a vós só
primeiro que outrem ninguém
não fôreis vós seu não fora
não sei se fiz mal se bem:
mas não pode ser senhora
para mal nenhum nascerdes
com este riso gracioso
que tendes sobr’olhos verdes:
conforto mais duvidoso
me é este que tomo assi
deus voos dê milhor ventura
da que tevestes té ‘qui:
que a dita e a fermosura
dizem patranhas antigas
que pelejaram um dia
sendo dantes muito amigas:
muitos hão que é fantasia
eu que vi tempos e anos
nenhuma cousa duvido
como ela é caso de danos:
mas nenhum mal nom é crido
o bem só é esperado
e na crença e na esperança
em ambas há i mudança
em ambas há i cuidado","from menina e moça
i’m thinking of you, dear girl,
your mother’s memory haunts me.
my eyes fill up with tears,
they are bathing you gently.
you were born amid sorrow—
may it yet prove a blessing.
since fortune, struck with envy,
singled you out at birth.
gone forever was contentment,
you heard no joyful voices.
your mother’s life had ended,
while ours went on in sadness.
in anguish born and raised!
i don’t know where all this is going.
i’ve watched you grow, my girl,
with green eyes so lovely.
beauty like yours wasn’t meant
to be born in exile. curses on
fate! this was clearly a work
of malevolence, not a mistake.
here lies your mother,
and we languish in grief.
you did nothing, my girl,
to incur a loss so great.
the fates spurn reason,
and will admit no protest.
i pity your poor father,
for the pain he must lament.
i heard you crying, alone,
before anyone else. you’d not
be here, had i not been there.
still, i ask if i did right.
but surely it can’t be wrong
for you to have been born
with that elegant smile of yours,
those dazzling green eyes.
it’s an unlikely comfort
that i take for myself.
may god grant you the grace
that has eluded you till now.
beauty and good fortune,
or so the old story goes,
were once the best of friends,
but became bitterly opposed.
many hold that it’s fantasy,
but in my life i’ve seen
enough not to doubt it:
fate inflicts great damage.
no harm is ever believed;
we always expect the good.
in hoping and believing
lies an element of change,
an element of concern.",pt_XX,en_XX,"Of the girl and maid,
Thinking of you, my daughter,
Your mother comes to mind,
My eyes fill with water,
In her I cleanse you:
Born amidst sorrow,
May you be well, daughter,
Fortune envies your birth:
Contentment was dead,
No joy did you hear,
Your mother was gone,
We others were sad:
Grown in pain, in pain,
I see no end to this plight,
I see you, fair daughter,
With green eyes grow tall:
This grace was not yours
To be born in exile,
Cursed be the misfortune
That put more than error in this:
Here lay your mother's grave,
To us, sorrow,
You were not meant, daughter,
To be mourned for:
No fate had reason,
Nor does it allow prayer
I deeply mourn your father,
Who will surely complain:
I heard only you,
First, before anyone else,
If you had not been his,
I know not if I did wrong or right:
But you cannot be mistress
To birth for any ill,
With this charming smile
That you show with green eyes:
This most doubtful comfort
I take thus,
May God grant you better fortune
Than what you've had till now:
For happiness and beauty
Ancient tales say
Fought one day,
Though once good friends:
Many say it's fancy,
I who've seen years and ages,
Question nothing,
As it's a case of sorrow:
Yet no evil is believed,
Good alone is hoped for,
In faith and in hope,
Both have change,
Both have care.",4
"porque o melhor, enfim,
é não ouvir nem ver…
passarem sobre mim
e nada me doer!
— sorrindo interiormente,
co’as pálpebras cerradas,
às águas da torrente
já tão longe passadas. —

às estações do ano.

no prado extenso e raso

fustigue-me o galope
de bandos de cavalos.

onde o viver ingrato
dispõe ao sacrifício

ruam pelas quebradas,
com choques de armaduras
e tinidos de espadas…
ou sob o piso, até,
infame e vil da rua,
onde a torva ralé
irrompe, tumultua,
se estorce, vocifera,
selvagem nos conflitos,
com ímpetos de fera
nos olhos, saltos, gritos…
roubos, assassinatos!
horas jamais tranquilas,
em brutos pugilatos
fraturam-se as maxilas...
e eu sob a terra firme,
compacta, recalcada,
muito quietinho. a rir-me
de não me doer nada.","in the end, it’s better
in the end, it’s better
not to hear or see…
to feel no pain at all

inwardly smiling,
eyelids closed,
at the floodwaters
off in the distance.
brawls, tussles, feuds,
all doing me no harm…
now a stranger to useless labor,
to the changing seasons.
summer passes, then autumn,
shearing, ploughing, hoeing—
while i sleep soundly,
underneath a rock.
better still if fortune
reserves a bed for me
in a wide meadow,
just beneath the grass
that april generously soaks…
and a band of horses
to pummel me now and then
with their gallant trotting.
or on the scrubby hills
where skirmishes play out,
where worthless life
assents to the sacrifice
of the living, bitter deaths
sweeping down the ravine,
to the crack of gunshot
and the clang of swords…
or even beneath
the mean, grubby streets
where the frightful throng
erupts in a tumult…
loudly jostling
in savage conflict,
feral gleams in their eyes,
leaping and shouting!
thievery and murder!
never a moment of peace
as jawbones shatter
in scrappy fistfights…
and i, so very still
beneath the tamped earth,
laughing so hard
because it doesn’t hurt.",pt_XX,en_XX,"because the best, at last,
is not to hear or see...
to let them pass by fast
and feel no pain for me!
— smiling inwardly,
with eyelids closed tight,
to waters that rush by,
long since out of sight. —
squabbles, uproars, strife,
cause me no harm at all...
uninvolved in vain strife,
through seasons, big or small.
autumn, summer, too,
pruning, plowing, and reaping,
and I asleep, anew,
beneath a stone, deep sleeping.
better yet if chance,
provides me a bed so free,
on the vast, flat expanse,
beneath the April grass alone.
slender, at intervals,
galloping hooves may sting,
as bands of horses prance,
with brisk and lively spring.
or in the wild, thin forest,
where strife is often found,
where harsh life, it is asserted,
disposes to be drowned
in sacrifices, deaths,
that echo through the hills,
with clanks of armor, and
the clang of swords that thrills...
or even under the floor,
of infamous, mean street,
where the wild rabble roar,
in tumult, causing heat.
they writhe, they scream, they fight,
like beasts with savage eyes,
in rough and brutal plight,
with leaps and loud cries.
robberies, murders done,
hours never peaceful lie,
in brutal fights, the bone,
of jaw, is often nigh.
and I, so snug and tight,
under the firm, pressed earth,
very quiet, and light,
laughing at not feeling worth.",4
"pulmões
[sobre a fotografia de uma criança encontrada morta numa praia da turquia]
o meu pai chamou-me e pediu-me que escolhesse
um brinquedo – só um – de que gostasse muito; e
que separasse outro brinquedo para o aylan, que
ainda não sabia escolher, mas só um, e tinha de
ser pequeno. o meu pai explicou-me que nessa
noite ia fazer de tudo quase nada numa trouxa
leve; porque assim, quando o aylan e eu caíssemos
de sono, ele e a minha mãe poderiam levar-nos ao
colo sem ficarem para trás. havia lágrimas nos olhos
do meu pai quando contou que, na manhã seguinte,
teríamos de deixar a nossa terra; mas logo se
recompôs, dizendo que kobanî também já não era
bem a nossa terra, que a nossa casa era a ruína da
nossa casa, que toda a síria não passava de um tímpano
exausto de tanto estrondo e dois olhos cansados,
mas tão cansados, de chamas e de sangue. o meu pai
achava que o aylan era demasiado pequeno para
compreender e, por isso, dissera-lhe apenas que
iríamos dar um passeio de barco, que passaríamos
o dia numa praia e que, enquanto eu e a minha mãe
nadássemos no mar até ficarmos sem fôlego, ele
podia simplesmente deitar-se de bruços na areia,
como tanto gostava. o meu pai nunca nos mentiu.","lungs
[on a photograph of a child found dead on a beach in turkey]
my father called me over and told me to pick out
a toy – just one – that i liked the most; and
to pick out another toy for aylan, who
was still too young to choose, but just one, and
it had to be small. my father told me that
tonight he’d wrap up our things in a light
bundle; this way, once aylan and i fell
asleep, he and my mother could carry us
without staying behind. there were tears in my father’s
eyes when he said that, tomorrow morning,
we’d have to leave our land; but he quickly
pulled it together, saying kobanî wasn’t really
our land anymore, that our home was the ruins
of our home, that all of syria was nothing but an eardrum
exhausted from all the noise and two eyes, tired,
so tired, of seeing flames and blood. my father
thought aylan was too little to
understand, so he just told him that
we were going on a boat ride, that we’d spend
the day on a beach and that, while my mother and i
swam in the sea until we were breathless, he
could simply lie face down in the sand,
as he loved to do so much. my father never lied to us.",pt_XX,en_XX,"lungs

"tempo e memória
em qualquer momento, no começo e no fim,
na medida de toda a vida, prostrados de toda a pena,
permanecemos sem amanhã nem princípio,
esbatidos na idade e na distância, saqueados na mentira,
apenas juntando a areia ao fundo de um recreio,
riscando a areia escorada do nosso entendimento,
a simular um amuleto contra o regresso impossível.
não temos trégua, não podemos voltar, e sem
ruído afastamo-nos para onde de longe chamamos
no ar rarefeito, entre os ramos, dos plátanos de ontem,
figuras resumidas a uma branca poeira informe,
em quantas inumeráveis semelhanças com a morte.

drawing lines through the dust that bears our understanding,
pretending there’s some lucky charm against the impossible return.
there’s no truce, we can’t go back, and soundless
we shift away towards there where we call from afar

figures compressed into shapeless white dirt,
in so many countless death similes.
sensing decay, this intimate decline of all there is,
fully aware of incertitude as the exhibited sign of memory
which exposes each breath of time as its own hoax

to simulate a talisman against the impossible return.
we have no respite, we cannot return, and in
silence we drift away to where from afar we call
in the thin air, among the branches, of yesterday's platanus trees,
figures reduced to a white, shapeless dust,
in countless innumerable likenesses with death.
foreseen ruin, that of the intimate decline of all this,
too aware in uncertainty as a sign of memory exposed,

not to believe in what we judge to have not happened,
not to understand the fair acceptance of our life.",4

e escarros escuros

do what she does to her clothes immerse,
I might lose my varied course,

in doing without a reason why,
and even while singing half,
beating clothes on that same shelf...

"que exíguo impulso se move e não esquecemos?
em que dádiva de chão dançamos com as mães cantantes,
onde estão as verdadeiras lágrimas, que as não vemos?
após anos de retiro, lumes brandos, luz de círios,
decorrido que foi o langor de sons pela geada, que
bem remanesce no contorno puído de cidades
– que graça confessamos ter decididamente tocado?
viemos de longe, de patíbulos que ninguém contará,
evocando pontos brumosos e vagas escolhas,
a custo apartados da dor de uma época a outra sobrepondo-se,
para ver enfim esquivas as mansardas donde partimos

e perceber que o caminho se faz lançando mão
ao que dele continuamente resvala, inaudível – apagando-se.

imersos no ruído de fundo de uma escadaria,
pouco a pouco premindo a vida ao tamanho último,

na qual só um recolhimento, tal a subir-se um vão de escada,
é a raiz do que em favor de nós fizemos,
a alegria que emana após o cativeiro.","what tiny, quivering impulse do we never quite forget?

after the torpor of sounds covered by frost
and lingering in the fraying contours of cities

with hazy junctures and choices written in our faces,
caught between the pain of one age and the next,

are all but lost and that we make our path by putting our hand
to what continually slips away, fading without a sound.

the happiness emerging in the wake of our captivity.",pt_XX,en_XX,"what scant impulse moves us, which we never forget?

espezinhada, por onde em grupos, sob os plátanos, já
na voz cabia a tremura que vinha de ceira rente aos cabelos –
“que só nos convirá em sorte acenar, acenar sempre, e sem remorso,
pois que é no que perdido foi que fomos deixando que se viva.”
por que ousaremos então mentir, gentil companheiro?
valerá o esforço em simular, a nossos pobres seguidores,
que nas saudações mais não estamos do que a compensar o nosso medo?
mentiremos sim, mas por razões distintas, algumas as referiste,
outras mercê de não nos vermos vacilar numa partida mais.

a linha que da vida fomos consentindo que se faça.

we grow with changes occurring in our soul, securing
the line we’ve allowed our life to trace.

last walked in our parish

now that all the time ahead of you is free?

a tristeza e aprende a reparti-la pelos dias
podem passar os meses e os anos nunca lhe faltará

e haver árvores ao fim da rua

regressa e entrar humildemente por engano pela morte dentro

que era o verão a única estação

e não soubemos ir até ao fundo da verdura

happy the man who manages sadness wisely
and learns to divide it among the days
though months and years pass it will never leave him
how sad it is to grow old on the doorstep
while weaving in our hands a belated heart
how sad to risk against human returns
the blue equilibrium of summer’s sheer mornings
by the ocean that overflows with us
in the long farewell of our condition
it is sad to see in the garden the sun’s solitude
reaching from the city’s houses and din
to a distant hint of river
and the meager life meted out to us
it is sadder to have to be born and to die
and to have trees at the end of the street
it is sad to go through life as if
returning and to enter humbly into death by mistake
it is sad in autumn to conclude that summer
was the only season
the wind passed by in solidarity and we didn’t see it
and we didn’t know to go to the green depths
like rivers that know where to find the sea
and know which bridges which streets which people which hills to talk with
through the words of a forever uttered water

between sunday and the smoke on a november afternoon

the blue balance of extreme summer mornings
along the overflowing sea of us

to see it from the murmur and the city houses
to a vague promise of a river
and the tiny life conceded to the nails
sadder yet to be born and to die
with trees standing at the end of the street
it's sad to tread life as one
to mistakenly enter humbly into death

that summer was the only season

and we did not go deep into the verdure

through words of water forever spoken
